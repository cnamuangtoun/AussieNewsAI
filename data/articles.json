(Dallas Kilponen)\n\nMelbourne tech entrepreneur Constantine Frantzekos is the brains behind Ansett's timely revival.\n\nHe said he spotted a \"quiet opportunity\" when he noticed the once-famous Ansett trademark had lapsed.\n\n\"I registered the trademark, created a fleet of AI agents, and \u2013 thanks to a tech integration with (Victoria's Startup of the Year) TRAVLR \u2013 The Future of Travel Commerce - have now turned Ansett into a one-founder online travel agency,\" Frantzekos said on LinkedIn.\n\nFrantzekos claims Ansett is the country's first \"truly AI-run travel agency\" and said it uses artificial intelligence to shave money off the price of hotels, flights and holiday packages.\n\nHis new website is already live with advertisements for holiday deals to the likes of Tokyo, Athens, Las Vegas and Bali.\n\nREAD MORE: Plane gashed open after airport collision in Melbourne\n\nAnsett Airlines was grounded in 2001 after Air New Zealand failed to find a buyer.

        "text": "When we're talking about winter illnesses, people use general terms like cold and the flu as if they're the same thing.\n\nBut while they both tend to make us feel pretty rubbish, there are some key differences between them.\n\nAt the same time, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is also circulating in the community, causing similar symptoms.\n\nHere are the differences between the common cold, the flu and RSV.\n\nWhat is a cold?\n\nIt's a generic term for an infection that generally affects a person's nose and throat.\n\nThere are more than 200 viruses that can cause a common cold, most of them being either a type of rhinovirus or coronavirus, Australia's public health information service, Healthdirect, says.\n\n\"The symptoms of a cold are usually mild,\" the service's website says.\n\n\"In most cases, you can treat the symptoms of a mild cold yourself.\n\n\"Most people will get better by themselves within seven to 10 days without any treatment.\"\n\nWhat is the flu?\n\nThe flu is a nickname for influenza.\n\nWhile you may hear people use cold and flu interchangeably, they're actually different diseases.\n\nAnd the flu can be much worse than a cold, Health Direct says.\n\nInfluenza B hitting children hard this flu season Photo shows A young girl in a hospital bed, surrounded by her parents and brother. After missing her flu vaccine for just one year Millie Campbell was fighting for her life.\n\nPeople at risk of developing a severe illness include young children, people over 65 years old and Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander people.\n\nPregnancy is also a risk factor for a serious bout of the flu.\n\nIn serious cases, the flu can lead to pneumonia, breathing difficulties and death.\n\n\"[But] most people will get better by themselves within seven to 10 days and without any treatment,\" Healthdirect's website says.\n\nRest and plenty of water as essential to fighting off an infection. (Getty Images: Roos Koole)\n\nWhat is RSV?\n\nRSV stands for respiratory syncytial virus.\n\nWhile it can affect people of all ages, it's most serious for infants, young children and older adults with chronic health conditions, Health Direct says.\n\nIt can lead to serious respiratory illnesses like bronchitis and pneumonia.\n\n\"There is no specific treatment for RSV, but having lots of rest and drinking plenty of fluids will help you recover,\" Healthdirect's website says.\n\n\"Most people recover from RSV in about 10 days.\"\n\nWhat are the symptoms of a cold, the flu or RSV?\n\nThey might sound the same, but there are specific differences between the three.\n\nHere's how Health Direct breaks it down:\n\nSymptom Cold Flu RSV Cough X X X Stuffy or runny nose X X X Sneezing X X Sore throat and sore ears X Headache X Red eyes X Loss of appetite X Irritability X Fever Some children may X Feeling hot or cold X Shivering X Diarrhoea or vomiting X Fatigue X Wheezing X Body ache X\n\nHowever, Healthdirect says that sometimes symptoms can differ and overlap.\n\nHow do I know if I should see a doctor?\n\nHealthdirect has an online service called Symptom Checker that helps you work out if you should see a doctor or treat yourself at home.\n\nIt asks you a few questions about your symptoms and gives you general advice.\n\nIt can also help you find a healthcare provider.\n\nThe service can help you decide whether you should see a doctor. (Healthdirect)\n\nBut, as a guide, Healthdirect has this advice on its flu website:\n\nSee your doctor if you: are concerned about your symptoms\n\nhave a high fever (over 38 degrees Celsius)\n\nhave a cough that's not improving\n\nare in a high-risk group\n\nWhen should I go to the hospital?\n\nWhile many people won't need specific medical treatment for mild respiratory illnesses, some cases can become quite serious.\n\nHealthdirect says people should call triple-0 if someone is having severe difficulty breathing or turning blue.\n\nHere are some more warnings on the service's website:\n\n\"If your baby is younger than 3 months old and has a fever above 38\u00b0Celsius, take them to the nearest hospital emergency department immediately, or call triple zero (000) and ask for an ambulance.\"\n\n\"If your child is having difficulty breathing, is turning blue, is grunting or is lethargic, call triple zero (000) and ask for an ambulance.\"\n\nThe service also has these specific warnings about the common cold on its website:\n\nSee your doctor urgently if you (or your child) have had cold or flu-like symptoms and you: have signs of dehydration\n\nare vomiting often\n\nhave an intense headache or neck stiffness\n\nhave chest pain\n\nhave trouble breathing\n\nhave a rash\n\nDoes it matter what I have?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had many of us used to the idea that we needed to test ourselves to understand what was causing our illness.\n\nWe asked Gemma Saravanos, a registered nurse and infectious diseases epidemiologist from the University of Sydney, if there was much point in that now.\n\n\"Knowing the specific pathogen causing your respiratory illness may not provide a benefit [for treatment], particularly if you have a mild illness and no risk factors for severe disease,\" Dr Saravanos said.\n\nHowever, there are a lot of benefits to testing.\n\n\"Home testing kits, or testing in healthcare services such as general practice, can guide our decision-making around infection prevention practices,\" Dr Saravanos says.\n\n\"Testing is also important for those who may be eligible for influenza or COVID-19 antiviral medication.\n\n\"Lastly, testing also serves a public health function. It helps us to understand what pathogens are circulating in the community and this can inform public health advice and research, such as vaccine effectiveness studies.\"\n\nTest your knowledge about influenza Photo shows A man with black hair and glasses wears a face mask while animated spike proteins surround him As influenza cases rise, so do the number of myths about how to treat it. We separate fact from fiction.\n\nShould I be testing myself?\n\n\"There are no clear guidelines for respiratory testing in the community,\" Dr Saravanos says.\n\nAnd it's not always easy \u2014 or cheap \u2014 to get tested.\n\n\"Testing may not always be available depending on access and affordability of home testing kits, and laboratory services,\" Dr Saravanos says.\n\n\"Without testing, it is very difficult to know what pathogen is causing a respiratory infection, so it's important to be guided by symptoms and modify our behaviours accordingly to avoid spreading infection.\n\n\"What feels like a mild cold for you may result in a severe illness for another person.\"\n\nSo knowing what you have might help you make better choices about where you go and what you do when you're sick.\n\n\"It's good to know because, for example, I've got parents in their 90s and if I've got a mild cold I might go and see them with a mask,\" Patrick Reading, director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, said.\n\n\"But if I've got influenza, that could be really life-threatening to them.\"\n\nHow do you treat a cold?\n\n\"Most respiratory infections can be safely managed at home with rest, hydration and over-the-counter analgesics (such as paracetamol),\" Dr Saravanos says.\n\n\"We do have antivirals to treat COVID-19 and influenza and these are recommended for older adults and those with certain risk factors.\"\n\nWe asked Dr Saravanos what sorts of foods people should eat if they wanted to speed up their recovery.\n\nBut there doesn't appear to be a magic formula.\n\n\"There is little evidence that foods or supplements will speed up recovery,\" she says.\n\nHow much time should you take off?\n\n\"Be guided by your symptoms,\" Dr Saravanos says.\n\n\"If you are feeling unwell or have active symptoms, it is best practice to stay home, especially in the first few days of illness.\n\n\"This supports recovery and also reduces the risk of passing the infection on to others.\"\n\nHow to call in sick Photo shows woman holding her dog while on the phone We look at your obligations when it comes to calling in sick, including what to say and what evidence you may need.\n\nWhen should you start exercising again?\n\n\"This depends on a range of factors, including severity of illness and individual characteristics such as immune function and fitness,\" Dr Saravanos says.\n\n\"A week may be sufficient for some people, however others will need more time for recovery.\"",

        "text": "Simon Braun is out for blood. Quite literally.\n\nThe father of three has spent the past year driving around the country with his kids, visiting the nearly 80 Lifeblood centres across Australia.\n\n\"Simmo\" said he hoped to enlist more than 33,000 new blood donations, donating plasma himself about every fortnight.\n\nBut tens of thousands of kilometres in a caravan, distance education, and regular donations have not drained him.\n\n\"Donating blood energises me,\" he said.\n\nNew recruits are part of the drive around Australia. (Supplied: Simon Braun)\n\nDonating blood has been a constant bright spot through Mr Braun's challenges.\n\nHe recalled sitting in the donor chair during a \"dark time\" in his life, and feeling \"genuinely happy\" for the first time in a long time.\n\nHe joined the dots.\n\n\"The best way to get out of your own head is to get into someone else's heart,\" he said.\n\nChanges and challenges to donation\n\nThere have long been barriers to blood donation for many people.\n\nThis month, Lifeblood relaxed its rules around sexual activity and donation.\n\nGay and bisexual men and transgender women who have sex with men were allowed to donate plasma.\n\nLifeblood said it was working towards similar changes for whole blood and platelet donation.\n\nChanges to donation rules came into effect this month. (AAP: Angela Brkic)\n\nIn 2022, people who were in the UK during the \"mad cow disease\" outbreak were allowed to donate again after a 22-year ban.\n\nLifeblood researcher Rachel Thorpe said while safety for donors and recipients was the priority, the organisation hoped to get as many people as possible in the blood donation chair.\n\n\"Ultimately we would like more people to be eligible to donate blood,\" she said.\n\nBeing in the regions has also stopped people donating, with Lifeblood centres concentrated in cities.\n\nWA has no permanent centres north of Perth, and the NT's only permanent centre is in Darwin.\n\nThere are pop up centres in some regional towns, and Lifeblood also has mobile \"blood buses\" to allow country people to donate.\n\nRegular visits from blood vans allow donation options in urban and regional centres.

(Supplied: Simon Braun)\n\nFear of needles has been another common setback. But Mr Braun said that was not necessarily a bad problem to have.\n\n\"It's actually quite a privilege to be able to, with courage, face your fear head-on,\" he said.\n\nHe encouraged nervous donors to keep recipients front of mind.\n\n\"Maybe that's the five-year-old with leukaemia who doesn't get a choice about whether they get the needle or not,\" he said.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut in the thousands of conversations Mr Braun has had about blood donation in the past year, the common theme was not fear, or lack of information, or distance.\n\nIt was time.\n\n\"Everybody's busy these days,\" he said.\n\n\"In fact, you ask someone how they are and they say 'busy'.\"\n\nHis answer to the dilemma was simple.\n\n\"A blood donation takes maybe seven minutes with a needle in the arm for whole blood, and you're in and out in half an hour,\" he said.\n\n\" That act can save three people's lives \u2014 so are you really so busy that your time is worth more than six lives an hour? \"\n\nBringing in new blood\n\nMr Braun and his family have been documenting each leg of their journey on The Bloody Good Tour website.\n\nSimon Braun visited Lifeblood centres all over the country. (Supplied: Simon Braun)\n\nThe culmination of the tour will be a national record attempt on July 31.\n\nMr Braun will be donating in Sydney, where the tour wraps up.\n\nBut he has asked people from all over the country to sign up to his donor team, to reach the most donations in a single day by one team.\n\nThe number to beat is 523: a record set by Commonwealth Bank employees in May.\n\n\"With a bit of cheek, we can't let a bank hold the record,\" Mr Braun said.",

        "text": "Australia's Alex de Minaur has won an epic Washington DC Open final against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, claiming his 10th singles title 7-3 in the final-set tiebreak.\n\nThe 5-7, 6-1, 7-6(3) victory gave de Minaur his first championship of 2025, and denied Davidovich Fokina his maiden title.\n\nComing off the disappointment of another impressive grand slam campaign at Wimbledon ending in comprehensive defeat, de Minaur showed all his shot-making, athleticism and grit in the three-hour, three-minute win.\n\nHe etches his name alongside Tony Roche (1971), Ken Rosewall (1972), Lleyton Hewitt (2004) and Nick Kyrgios (2019, 2022) as Australian winners in the US capital.\n\nIt also propels the 26-year-old back into the top 10 after a brief absence, as the tour ramps up towards the US Open.\n\nDe Minaur was favoured against his 26th-ranked opponent, but it was clear from the outset he would not have it all his own way as Davidovich Fokina produced some stirring shots to win the first set in over an hour.\n\nThe Australian number one hit back by tearing through the second set 6-1, before being broken in the fourth game of the decider as Davidovich Fokina jumped out to 4-1 and 5-2 leads.\n\nThe 26-year-old served for the match at 5-3 and looked set for his first championship since turning pro in 2017 as he skipped to 30-0, before de Minaur battled back with four straight points to get back on serve.\n\nDown 15-30 on his serve, de Minaur framed a low volley that snuck over the net and out of his opponent's reach before the pair carried on to the first of six deuces in what turned out to be a 10-minute game, during which de Minaur fought off three match points.\n\nBoth players overcame any jangling nerves with successive clutch service holds to send the match to a tiebreak.\n\nDe Minaur got the early mini break to jump out to a 2-0 lead, before being reeled back in to 2-2, only to poke his nose back out in front at 4-2.\n\nDavidovich Fokina stayed in it with de Minaur's unforced error to keep it on serve, but the Australian rattled off three straight points to close out the match and win a thrilling decider with an ace.\n\nDe Minaur launched a ball into the stands, let out a primal scream and punched the air before shaking hands at the net with a clearly emotional Davidovich Fokina, who then slumped in his chair and buried his face on his towel.\n\nDe Minaur, who played junior tennis in Spain while living there as a teenager, sat with Davidovich Fokina and put his arm around the Malaga native who looked utterly crestfallen having fallen short in a final for the third time this year.\n\n\"You're way too good to not have one of these; it's coming for sure. You deserved it today, I just got lucky,\" the Australian said in the trophy presentation.\n\n\"You are a hell of a competitor, hell of a player. No-one on the tour wants to play you. This is not the end, this is only going up for you.\"\n\nOn the women's side, 2021 US Open runner-up Leylah Fernandez had a much easier time of it, brushing aside Russian Anna Kalinskaya 6-1, 6-2 in just over an hour.",

        "text": "For more than 125 years Mossman's cane growers have delivered a crop to the mill for crushing, but for some this year will be the last.\n\nSince the closure last year of their local factory near Port Douglas in Queensland's far north, farmers have been experimenting with other crops, as the future of their multi-generational industry is still uncertain.\n\nTheir current harvest is trucked 100 kilometres to Mulgrave for crushing, but this subsidised short-term solution may not be sustainable long term.\n\nThe Queensland government has put together a $12.5 million package announced in the budget to support Mossman cane growers with the loss of the sugar mill.\n\nAbout $6m of those funds will fully subsidise the cost of transporting this season's cane harvest from Mossman to Mulgrave Mill, which is critical for growers to make a profit.\n\nThe other $6m will be used to work towards long term solutions and projects beyond 2025.\n\nDiscussions between stakeholders are taking place about how this money is best spent.\n\nDetermined to stay on the land, growers say they have no choice but to try growing crops other than cane.\n\nSpeculation continues about potential buyers of the mill. (Supplied: Far Northern Milling)\n\nGrowers transitioning to new industries\n\nFourth-generation Mossman farmer Don Murday is the deputy chair of Queensland Cane, Agriculture and Renewables, a group that advocates for sugar growers.\n\nHe believes making fuel from plants is the future for Mossman, and has been trialling bana grass, a crop similar to sugarcane but without the sucrose content, used to create biofuels.\n\nHe said the results had been great so far and this would most likely be his last year growing sugarcane.\n\nBana grass looks and grows like sugarcane. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\n\"The leading projects I believe in this transition are bana grass for renewable energy,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm going to transition into bana grass with maybe a few other crops in the interim, but I won't be planning any more sugarcane.\n\n\"I may well be taking the sugarcane out after this harvest.\"\n\nFrom a financial perspective, Mr Murday said using the grass to produce biomass \u2014 organic material that can be converted into a renewable energy source \u2014 was a viable option.\n\n\"With the predicted tonnages of the bana grass and the price that's being offered, we're looking at gross value of between $4,000 and $5,000 per hectare with lower growing cost than sugarcane,\" he said.\n\n\"So I believe growing the bana grass will compare very favourably to growing the sugarcane at the current prices.\"\n\nThe Mossman mill closed last year. (Supplied: Far Northern Milling)\n\nMatthew Watson also farms in Mossman and has been trialling different crops including coffee, cocoa, corn and sorghum.\n\nHe also sees potential in bana grass, which he said was practical to grow in the district.\n\n\"Bana grass is a grass the same as cane \u2026 it grows the same, you can plant it the same, cut it the same [and] we've got all the machinery to do that,\" Mr Watson said.\n\n\"It seems to be growing really well in the trial patches that they've got around the district at the moment.\n\n\" I can't see any reason why it wouldn't, you know, be the greatest thing since sugarcane. What we do with it is the million-dollar question. \"\n\nMatthew Watson has been trialling other crops. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nNeed for processing facility\n\nGrowing anything without a local processor would be challenging, and Mr Murday and Mr Watson are both apprehensive about what will become of the Mossman factory.\n\nMr Murday said he hoped it could be turned into a biomass processing facility.\n\n\"It's probably 12 to 18 months before we're going to have any commercial quantities [of bana grass] available, and one of the processes that we're looking at is could effectively be operating within 12 months from the time they're given the go-ahead,\" he said.\n\n\" It is feasible, it's just a matter of getting through this process of acquiring the mill site if it's necessary, or someone coming in and starting up separately \u2014 I'm not sure which the process is going to be. \"\n\nSome farmers won't make concrete decisions until the future of the mill is more certain. (ABC Rural: Sophie Johnson)\n\nFor now, Mr Murday is only growing bana grass for propagation \u2014 experimenting with reproducing the plants \u2014 and not for commercial processing.\n\nMr Watson said it would be hard to see a clear future for his farm until more decisions about ownership of the mills or new processing facilities were made.\n\n\"We really just don't know, unfortunately,\" he said.\n\n\"The killer is the not knowing what you're doing from day to day, trying not to get stuck in the negatives.\"",

(ABC News: Liam Patrick)\n\nWhat happens if the conventions are breached?\n\nProfessor Twomey said it \"comes down to the people\".\n\n\"It's really a political matter as to how effective they are.

(ABC News: Trent Murphy)\n\nThat was all thrown into jeopardy on Thursday, when Bedford revealed that it was on the verge of entering administration due to cash flow issues.\n\nThe state government stepped in on Sunday with a $15 million loan to \"stave off\" administration, at least temporarily, so the disability employment organisation could get back on its feet.\n\nMr Stevens said he was \"shocked [and] disappointed\" when he heard that Bedford was in trouble.\n\n\"It was really nerve-racking because you thought you were going to lose your job on the spot,\" he said.\n\n\"We were all heartbroken and shocked.\"\n\nHis father Wayne Stevens said the work gave his son daily structure.\n\n\"It has been something for him to go to on a daily basis, and to me, going to a job in a normal sense is more than just money, it's also giving you a purpose,\" Wayne Stevens said.\n\nDavid Stevens (left) and his father Wayne were worried about Bedford's future. (ABC News)\n\nWayne Stevens said he would be concerned for his son and other employees if Bedford was to close.\n\n\"David was really concerned and when we found out \u2026 [Sunday] morning, David felt so relieved, like a weight had fallen off him that he knows that his job is more stable than what it was a couple days ago,\" he said.\n\n\"Knowing that David can still go tomorrow [Monday], still enjoy the friendship of his friends, work there for four days a week \u2014 that has taken a lot off my mind.\"\n\nLoan is conditional, government says\n\nIt is understood Bedford employs more than 800 staff and supports 1,400 people living with a disability at more than 22 sites across South Australia.\n\nBedford's chief executive officer, Myron Mann, has resigned but its chair Janet Miller, who offered to step down, remained in her role.\n\nIn exchange for the $15 million rescue package, the state government will take ownership of Bedford's supported accommodation site Balyana, in Clapham.\n\nBedford's financial status leaves families 'shocked' Photo shows Two men standing in front of a wall of pot plants Families are hoping disability employment provider Bedford Group can be saved to protect the jobs and livelihoods of more than 1,000 South Australian workers who rely on its service.\n\nSA Premier Peter Malinauskas said Bedford's financial position was so \"dire\" that without a loan, the organisation would inevitably lead to liquidation \"by the end of this week if not sooner\".\n\n\"Does anyone seriously think we should sit on our hands and let this hit the fans, and 1,400-1,500 people have their worlds turned upside who were really vulnerable? I just wasn't going to let that happen,\" he said.\n\n\"Jurisdiction responsibilities become a second order of consideration than just doing the right thing.\"\n\nHe told ABC Radio Adelaide advisory firm McGrathNicol had been appointed to work with Bedford on a restructure and \"stem the losses\" in excess of $1 million per month.\n\n\"If that can happen, maybe there is future for Bedford to stand on its own two feet,\" he said.\n\nPremier Peter Malinauskas and Bedford chair Janet Miller announced the loan on Sunday (ABC News: Trent Murphy)\n\nMr Malinauskas said the loan helped saved the Balyana facility, which houses 40 residents but was \"essentially at end of life or fast approaching them\".\n\n\"By us purchasing it, we achieved two things; one we protected the taxpayers' interests as part of this rescue package because it now [has] an asset,\" he said.\n\n\"The second thing is it allows for more thoughtful and compassionate planning around those supported accommodation residents on that facility and a plan for a transition into the future rather than just a overnight liquidation set of circumstances.\"\n\nTreasurer Stephen Mullighan said on Sunday the loan and the transfer of ownership of the Balyana site were \"a good way to structure this support, rather than just providing a cash grant with no recourse for the taxpayers in the future\".\n\nHe added that there would be conditions imposed on how the loan was spent.\n\n\"It won't be a single deposit tomorrow of $15 million and then Bedford has free and unfettered access to it,\" he said.\n\nMartin Mcdermott was glad he can continue to work at Bedford.

        "text": "After spending more than 20 years loyally guarding a flock of about 150 sheep, Larry the llama met a gruesome end in the jaws of one or more roaming dogs.\n\nWARNING: This article contains an image that some readers might find distressing.\n\nOn the day Larry was mauled to death, his owner, Laura Elson, found four dogs running amok on her hobby farm, east of Geraldton.\n\nBut the dogs were not wild \u2014 they were domestic pets, and at least three had registered owners.\n\nOn the day of the attack last month, Ms Elson first realised something was wrong when she caught a pair of border collies on her farm.\n\nShe called City of Greater Geraldton rangers and, accompanied by one, went to check on her flock.\n\n\"We found a freshly dead lamb and a limping ewe,\" Ms Elson said.\n\nPaw prints in the sand where Larry the llama was found dead. (Supplied: Laura Elson)\n\nShortly after the rangers left with the border collies, Ms Elson went back to the paddock for a more thorough check, which is when she found a third dog.\n\n\"I loaded that one up, then I located a fourth dog \u2026 loaded that one up, and then I called the rangers back again to come and collect the other two dogs,\" she said.\n\nIt was then that she noticed one had blood on its fur.\n\nThe ranger accompanied her to Larry's paddock, where they found him deceased.\n\nA devastated Ms Elson said llamas only lived to between 15 and 20 years, but Larry \"was a bit of a record breaker\".\n\nInitially bought in a pair, her beloved pet had outlived his paddock mate, who died of old age.\n\n\"Larry was quite content, as long as he had sheep company, to keep on doing his job by himself,\" she said.\n\nLarry the llama was found deceased in his paddock with bite marks. (Supplied: Laura Elson)\n\nLack of prosecution 'ridiculous'\n\nThree of the dogs were returned by rangers to their owners, while one has not been claimed.\n\nThe owners who could be identified were issued with fines for not containing their pets or failing to ensure they had collars, with the penalties averaging about $500 for each owner.\n\nMs Elson is angry that no one has been held responsible for the attack on Larry or her livestock.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the rangers said that they can't prosecute,\" Ms Elson said.\n\n\"It would be passed out in court as beyond reasonable doubt because I didn't visually see the dogs attacking him.\"\n\nMs Elson said rangers should have more power to declare dogs as dangerous.\n\n\"I think it's ridiculous,\" she said.\n\n\" I find four dogs and a freshly dead llama and freshly dead lamb, and yet that's not enough evidence for the dogs to be held accountable or their owners, even more so, to be held accountable. \"\n\nRangers 'distressed' over cases\n\nCity of Greater Geraldton ranger coordinator Mark Lambert said they still considered the case to be \"open\".\n\nHowever, prosecution was difficult in situations such as these because court cases had to meet criminal standards of proof, he said.\n\n\"We work within the legislation of the Dog Act of 1976,\" he said.\n\n\"That puts us into a criminal framework and any potential prosecutions, in a Magistrate's Court.\n\n\"We have to operate under evidence rules, and that evidence that we have to provide needs to prove things beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nLarry the llama had outlived his pack mate but was content with the company of sheep. (Supplied: Laura Elson)\n\nMr Lambert said such attacks were upsetting for his team, particularly when they could not resolve a case.\n\n\"A lot of the rangers are animal lovers, and that's why they do this job,\" he said.\n\n\"They do get very distressed when they cannot provide the level of service that they want to provide and cannot bring a positive resolution to an incident, particularly with the dog attacks when we've got stock that are being killed or badly injured.\"\n\nMr Lambert said the city averaged about 15 reports a month of attacks on people, pets or livestock, most of which could be prevented.\n\n\"It really is a big call-out to our community to please check your fencing, make sure that it's good, that it can contain your dog appropriately,\" he said.\n\n\"Keep keep your gates closed. Make sure you know where your dog is. Make sure it's contained, and we can really make a big impact on these dog attack figures.\"",

I think that was tongue in cheek.\"\n\nUltimately the match rolled on for a few more overs, with the handshakes inevitably coming after Sundar reached his first Test century on a languid day-five pitch.\n\n\"[England] dominated this Test match, but [have] to admit that the wicket won at the end of the day,\" former England captain Alastair Cook said on BBC.\n\n\"We don't want wickets like this, we want them to deteriorate and wickets like this make batting look very easy on day five \u2014 we want jeopardy either towards the end or at the start.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

(Supplied: Sean Dooley)\n\nSean Dooley from BirdLife Australia said shifting climate patterns could be a factor in why the birds had not moved down the mountains.\n\n\"It could be related to the fact that over the past decade or so, we have had much milder winters, and perhaps the gang-gangs have started to adapt to this shift in climate and not been moving as far,\" he said.\n\n\" So when we get an old-fashioned winter blast, some birds are being caught out. \"\n\nEndangered and at risk\n\nAccording to the latest data, gang-gang populations have already suffered a sharp decline \u2014 a drop of nearly 70 per cent between 1999 and 2019.\n\nThe 2019\u20132020 bushfires caused further devastation.\n\nGang-gang added to threatened list Photo shows Two gang-gang cockatoos in a tree. The gang-gang cockatoo will be added to the threatened species list after climate change and bushfires impact populations.\n\nIn 2022, the parrot was officially listed as endangered, with an estimated 25,300 mature birds remaining in the wild.\n\n\"Experts say the likely reason for the decline in gang-gangs has been the destruction of the big old, hollow-bearing trees that they nest in up in mountainous areas, from native-forest logging,\" Mr Dooley said.\n\n\" With fewer gang-gangs around, events like the recent cold snap will have a greater impact on the overall population. \"\n\nCold blast not over yet\n\nA Bureau of Meteorology spokesperson confirmed that much of Victoria had endured below-average minimum temperatures for June.\n\nThe snow dump has arrived just in time for the Victorian and New South Wales winter school holidays. (Supplied: Vail Resorts.)\n\nAnd while there is still cold weather ahead in the short term, the bureau's forecast for August to October is for warmer-than-average temperatures.\n\nUntil then, Falls Creek head of visitor experience David Leathem urged snow-goers to keep an eye out for \"vulnerable species, particularly the endangered gang-gang cockatoo\".\n\n\"Immediate action can make all the difference,\" he said.\n\n\"We encourage residents and visitors to stay alert and contact local wildlife carers for assistance and advice.\"",

        "text": "England defender Lucy Bronze says she has played the entire European Championships tournament with a broken tibia.\n\nThe Lionesses beat Spain 3-1 in a penalty shootout to win Euro 2025 and defend its title after an enthralling game that ended 1-1 after extra time in Basel, with Chloe Kelly firing home the decisive spot kick.\n\nBut after the match, 33-year-old Chelsea fullback Bronze disclosed she had been playing through considerable pain.\n\n\"I actually played the whole tournament with a fractured tibia, but no-one knew,\" Bronze told the BBC, with coach Sarina Wiegman confirming her star right back's plight.\n\n\"That is why I got a lot of praise from the girls after the Sweden game because I have been in a lot of pain.\n\n\"But if that's what it takes to play for England, that's what I'll do. They know that. We inspire each other by playing through things like that and it got us to the end, in the end.\"\n\nBronze, England's most decorated player and, with 140 caps one of its most experienced, played 598 minutes throughout the tournament, the fourth most minutes of any England player.\n\nShe even scored in the quarterfinal victory over Sweden that sent the game to extra time.\n\n\"She had some issues with her tibia so of course we tried to manage that,\" Weigman said.\n\n\"When you play 120 minutes you're not managing it, are you?\n\n\"The whole team has a great mentality but she has a crazy mentality. It's unbelievable.\"\n\nThe BBC pundits were aghast at the lengths Bronze went to in order to play, describing her efforts as \"not normal\".\n\n\"I mean this in the nicest way but she is not human,\" Ellen White told the BBC.\n\n\"I love her and adore her, but she is proper England.\n\n\"To say she has just won a major tournament on a fractured tibia, that is not normal. That pain must have been insane.\"\n\nKelly the hero as England fights back again\n\nChloe Kelly was once again the hero for England. (Getty Images: James Gill/Danehouse)\n\nEngland's victory was another spectacular turnaround from Sarina Wiegman's side, which came back from two goals down to beat Sweden in a shootout in the last eight and beat Italy in the semifinals with another extra-time goal from Kelly.\n\nWorld and Nations League champions Spain made the breakthrough in the 25th minute as Ona Batlle crossed and caught the England defence flat-footed, allowing Mariona Caldentey to head the ball past goalkeeper Hannah Hampton.\n\nIt put Spain in a position to emulate its 1-0 win over England in the 2023 World Cup final, but Kelly's introduction proved a turning point.\n\nWith Lauren James suffering an ankle injury, England was struggling, but Kelly came off the bench to replace her just before the break.\n\nKelly, the extra-time hero from England's 2022 final win over Germany, helped close down England's porous left flank and provided the cross for Alessia Russo to level in the 57th minute, the forward heading home her inch-perfect assist.\n\nSpain continued to monopolise the ball but could not find another goal before the end of normal time, and the story continued through extra time as they pressed and probed, but could not break the English defence as the game finished 1-1.\n\nThe Spaniards got the shootout off to a great start when Cata Coll stopped Beth Mead's effort \u2014 controversially retaken after she initially scored but was called to retake due to a double touch \u2014 but England keeper and player of the final Hannah Hampton saved from Caldentey and from Aitana Bonmati to put England in the driving seat.\n\nDo you have a story idea about women in sport? Email us abcsport5050@your.abc.net.au\n\nColl got Spain back into it with another one-handed stop to block Leah Williamson, but Spain substitute Salma Paralluelo hit her kick wide of the target.\n\nThat set the stage for Kelly to repeat her 2022 heroics, making her trademark prancing run-up before smashing the ball into the net and peeling away in ecstasy to celebrate with her teammates in front of the England fans.\n\n\"I'm so proud, so proud of this team, so grateful to wear this badge, and I'm so proud to be English \u2026 I was cool, I was composed and I knew I was going to hit the back of the net,\" Kelly said.\n\nThe final was the first time since the inaugural edition in 1984, in which England were beaten by Sweden, that the tournament was decided by a penalty shootout.\n\nFor player of the tournament Bonmati, the defeat was bitter.\n\n\"I don't have much emotion left to be honest. I have emptied myself of emotion. We are all exhausted,\" she said.\n\n\"I have to say sorry, because it was my fault in the end, but I was not able to score it [the penalty]. Congratulations to our opponents.\n\n\"In my opinion we were superior in the match, [but] on some occasions, that's not enough in football.\"\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

        "text": "Agreeing to buy energy from the US was a no-brainer for the EU and Japan, given their reliance on imported energy. The EU, which ended its purchases of Russian gas after the invasion of Ukraine, now imports about half its LNG from the US. LNG is a commodity traded at global market prices, so there is no financial penalty for the EU in sourcing more gas from the US. Perversely, however, there could be an adverse impact on the US - its increased exports of LNG in recent years have flowed through to higher US domestic gas prices. The deals that may underpin this new global trade order have been hastily and clumsily negotiated, are half-formed and have unintended consequences for American companies, consumers and the US economy. The promise, if there is one, to invest $US600 billion in the US was vague and one whose delivery is beyond the EU\u2019s control. It is individual European companies that would have to decide whether or not to invest. Unlike the deal with Japan, where Trump claimed the Japanese would invest $US550 billion in a fund from which the US would get 90 per cent of the profits, the investment agreement with the EU appears just a broad statement of intent.\n\nTrump and his administration have a tendency to over-egg their accomplishments. The Japanese version of what they have agreed to, for instance, varies significantly from what Trump has described. The Japanese have agreed to provide equity, loans and loan guarantees for investments in the US, but government officials say any profits would be split according to the level of contributions made and that the final degree of profit-sharing would rest with the private sector companies involved and the returns they required. It would appear the Japanese envisage their state agencies mainly facilitating debt funding for US projects, with the decisions on which projects to pursue and the apportionment of profits left to the Japanese and US companies involved. Trump said Japan would invest, \u201cat my discretion,\u201d the $US550 billion but, as is the case with the EU, he can\u2019t force Japanese companies to invest.\n\nIt should be noted that the presentation card on Trump\u2019s desk that outlined the investment agreement originally said Japan would invest $US400 billion, but the \u201c$400B\u201d was crossed out with a marker pen (a Sharpie, perhaps) and altered to $US500 billion. When Trump announced the detail, in a post on Truth Social, it had suddenly become $US550 billion. It is unclear whether the Japanese were consulted on the revisions. What that episode demonstrates is how rushed the trade deals have been as the administration tries to demonstrate that the threat of Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs has been successful in forcing other countries to accept Trump\u2019s terms before the 90-day delay before those tariffs are imposed expires on August 1. That\u2019s why there are obvious blank pages in the EU and Japanese deals to be filled in before they remotely resemble a fully-detailed trade agreement.\n\nIt\u2019s also why, as is the case with Australia\u2019s recent decision to allow more imports of American processed beef, the outcome of the agreements will depend, not on what Trump decrees or the EU and Japanese trade negotiators have agreed to, but on companies and consumers within the markets that the US says it is opening up. The Japanese won\u2019t buy any meaningful volume of US SUVs and pick-up trucks. There is no market for them in Japan and the American auto companies aren\u2019t going to re-tool in order to produce a few gas-guzzling right-hand drive vehicles. Trump mused that the Europeans would enjoy those SUVs and pick-ups. He doesn\u2019t appreciate that there are significant cultural differences between Europeans and Americans and that it is improbable that the narrow and congested streetscapes in European cities are suddenly going to be littered with over-sized US vehicles. Trump doesn\u2019t appreciate that there are significant cultural differences between Europeans and Americans and that it is improbable that the narrow and congested streetscapes in European cities are suddenly going to be littered with over-sized US vehicles. Credit: iStock The 15 per cent tariff on European auto and auto part exports is, however, a big win for the Europeans, as were the same tariff concessions won by the Japanese.\n\nThe EU and Japanese carmakers don\u2019t face tariffs on their raw materials, like steel and aluminium, or components. Their US counterparts, which are heavily integrated into a North American auto industry, with cars and components flowing across the borders with Mexico and Canada, do. Thanks to Trump, who has imposed 25 per cent duties on imports of steel, aluminium, auto parts and those components of US autos not made within the US, the European and Japanese companies will have a material competitive advantage over America\u2019s own carmakers. The fact that the two key trading partners, both heavily reliant on the auto industry, were able to win such advantages for their companies says that, in its haste to proclaim that Trump\u2019s tariffs threats have produced results, the administration hasn\u2019t looked at the complex ways the deals interact with America\u2019s own industries and their supply chains. It does seem rather bizarre that Trump is using the threat of punitive tariffs to bludgeon other countries into trade deals that gives their key industries what is effectively a tariff advantage over his own. He and his advisers also don\u2019t appear to appreciate that allowing tariff-free imports of products from the US is irrelevant if consumers aren\u2019t going to buy what the US is selling or, as is the case with the 100 Boeing aircraft that Japan agreed to buy, if the US companies can\u2019t deliver what the countries have agreed to buy. Boeing\u2019s current backlog of orders is about 6000 planes, or nearly 17 years of production at the rate at which it delivered planes last year.",

Alphington is quite resilient,\u201d he said.\n\nLoading \u201cIt is an interesting pocket of Melbourne with a lot of families and more family homes. It is less dense than other areas of the inner north, but you still have access to all the things in the area.\u201d The property was one of 752 scheduled for auction in Melbourne in the past week. By Saturday evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 75.8 per cent from 557 reported results, while 44 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate. A three-level townhouse in Eltham designed by renowned architect Graeme Gunn sold under the hammer for $1.41 million on Saturday. The home at 2/93 Arthur Street was advertised with a reserve of $1,300,000, which selling agent Tom Kurtschenko from Jellis Craig said \u201cwas part of the strategy going into the auction\u201d.\n\nPositioned at the highest point of Eltham, the home is a part of the gated Kinloch Estate, which was established in 2000. The property\u2019s treetop and city views on the upper level, along with its three bedrooms and thoughtfully crafted layout, attracted two active bidders, both local families, to the area. \u201cThe two bidders went toe to toe,\u201d Kurtschenko said. \u201cIt got a run on, and it was a pretty clean auction and got to where it needed to.\u201d\n\nLoading The successful bidders want to do some improvements to bring the home back to its former glory, Kurtschenko said. \u201cIt\u2019s a 25-year-old home, and it\u2019s just showing its age a little bit,\u201d he said. Stock markets in the local market were \u201cvery low\u201d, the agent said. \u201cLocally in Eltham and Eltham North, there are 75 homes up for sale, which is well down. It usually trends at around 110 to 130 homes, so it is notably down, so I think that\u2019s putting pressure on what\u2019s on the market,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, in Mornington, a deceased estate located in an ex-housing commission area fetched $815,000 at auction, above its reserve of $690,000. 13 Carramar Street originally had a price guide of $610,000-$670,000, which was increased in week two of the campaign to $640,000-$680,000, said selling agent James Stamatopoulos of Ray White Frankston. \u201cGiven the amount of interest we had, we wanted to make the price guide more transparent,\u201d he said. The auction drew four bidders, a diverse mix of aspiring first home buyers, downsizers, investors and developers.\n\nLoading The underbidders were downsizers who wanted to relocate from the city, and the successful bidders were investors from Sydney. \u201cWe are seeing more interstate investor interest in this pocket,\u201d said Stamatopoulos. \u201cThere\u2019s great value here and buyers are responding.\u201d For the sellers, the sale was bittersweet.",

        "text": "The United States struck a framework trade deal with the European Union on Monday AEST, imposing a 15 per cent import tariff on most EU goods, but averting a spiralling battle between two allies which account for almost a third of global trade.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement came after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen travelled for talks with US President Donald Trump at his golf course in western Scotland to push a hard-fought deal over the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think this is the biggest deal ever made,\" Trump told reporters after an hour-long meeting with von der Leyen, who said the 15 per cent tariff applied \"across the board\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have a trade deal between the two largest economies in the world, and it's a big deal. It's a huge deal. It will bring stability. It will bring predictability,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deal, which also includes US$600 billion ($915 billion) of EU investments in the US and US$750 billion ($1.14 trillion) of EU purchases of US energy over Trump's second term, will indeed bring clarity for EU companies.\n\n\n\nEven so, the baseline 15 per cent tariff will be viewed by many in Europe as a poor outcome compared with the initial European ambition of a zero-for-zero tariff deal, although it is better than the threatened 30 per cent rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed the deal, saying in a statement that a trade conflict had been averted that would have hit Germany's export-driven economy and its large auto sector hard.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Bernd Lange, the German Social Democrat who chairs the trade committee of the European Parliament, said he was \"quite critical\" because the tariffs were imbalanced and the pledged $600 billion of investment would likely come at the expense of EU industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe euro rose around 0.2 per cent against the US dollar, UK pound sterling and Japanese yen within an hour of the deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deal mirrors key parts of the framework agreement the US clinched with Japan last week.\n\n\n\nThe agreement will mean EU goods exported to the US will be liable for a 15 per cent tariff. Source: AAP / Davide Bonaldo / SOPA Images \"We are agreeing that the tariff ... for automobiles and everything else will be a straight-across tariff of 15 per cent,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat rate, however, will not apply to steel and aluminium, for which a 50 per cent tariff will remain in place, although von der Leyen said it would be cut and replaced with a quota system.\n\n\n\n\n\nVon der Leyen said the rate also applied to semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, and there would be no tariffs from either side on aircraft and aircraft parts, certain chemicals, certain generic drugs, semiconductor equipment, some agricultural products, natural resources and critical raw materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will keep working to add more products to this list,\" she said, adding that the situation on spirits was still to be established.\n\n\n\n\n\nEric Winograd, chief economist at investment firm AllianceBernstein in New York, noted the similarity with Japan's US deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will need to see how long the sides stick to the deal. From a market perspective, it is reassuring in the sense that having a deal is better than not having a deal,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTrump, who is seeking to reorder the global economy and reduce decades-old US trade deficits, has so far reeled in agreements with the United Kingdom, Japan, Indonesia and Vietnam, although his administration has failed to deliver on a promise of \"90 deals in 90 days\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has periodically railed against the European Union, saying it was \"formed to screw the United States\" on trade.\n\n\n\n\n\nArriving in Scotland, Trump said the EU wanted \"to make a deal very badly\" and said, as he met von der Leyen, that Europe had been \"very unfair to the United States\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHis main concern is the US merchandise trade deficit with the EU, which in 2024 reached US$235 billion ($357 billion), according to data from the US Census Bureau.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU points to the US surplus in services, which it says partially redresses the balance. Trump also discussed the \"hundreds of billions of dollars\" that tariffs were generating.\n\n\n\nOn 12 July, Trump threatened to apply a 30 per cent tariff on imports from the EU starting on 1 August, after weeks of negotiations with the major US trading partners failed to reach a comprehensive trade deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU had prepared counter tariffs on \u20ac93 billion ($166 billion) of US goods in the event there was no deal, and Trump had pressed ahead with 30 per cent tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome member states had also pushed for the bloc to use its most powerful trade weapon, the anti-coercion instrument, to target US services in the event of a no-deal.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Gwyneth Paltrow is starring in a new ad for Astronomer.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost a fortnight after the tech company's married CEO, Andy Byron, was caught on a Coldplay concert kiss cam with his arms around his HR executive Kristin Cabot, Paltrow has been hired as a \"temporary\" spokesperson for Astronomer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 52-year-old, who was married to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin from 2003 until 2016, appeared in a short video on Astronomer's social media speaking about the company's strengths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've been hired on a very temporary basis to speak on behalf of the 300-plus employees at Astronomer. Astronomer has gotten a lot of questions over the last few days, and they wanted me to answer the most common one,\" she says in the ad.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first question, \"OMG! What the actual f***?\", then appeared on the screen in writing.\n\n\n\nHowever, she dodged the question and plugged the company's products: \"We've been thrilled so many people have a newfound interest in data workflow automation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next question to Astronomer was, \"How is your social media team holding ...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Paltrow moved on before the whole question could be asked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will now be returning to what we do best, which is delivering game-changing results for our customers. Thank you for your interest in Astronomer,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe video was captioned: \"Thank you for your interest in Astronomer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial media users chimed in after the video was released, with tech journalist Neville Lahiru saying: \"Getting Chris Martin's ex-wife was a genius move lol.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPR and communications consultant Ronke Lawal lauded the move as an \"engaging way to handle a PR crisis\" and \"socially relevant without being too corny and cringe.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother user, Matt Brian, commented: \"Marketing genius. Owning the Coldplay kiss cam video *and* hiring Chris Martin\u2019s ex-wife? Splendid.\"\n\n\n\nAt Coldplay's 15 July concert near Boston, a cameraman panned across the crowd and showed Byron and Cabot in an embrace.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a video shared to TikTok, as the couple frantically tried to dodge the camera, frontman Martin could be heard saying: \"Oh, look at these two. All right, c'mon, you're okay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Oh, what? Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Byron and Cabot have since resigned from the company.\n\n\n\n",

I started to like be a bit scared, a bit concerned, like oh.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's returned every six months since to monitor more closely how the condition is progressing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost 300,000 people in Australia live with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C - often without any warning signs of liver damage.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Gregory Dore of the Kirby Institute says that silent progression is exactly why routine testing matters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because it doesn't cause symptoms in the initial years, and sometimes even in the initial decades of infection, that's why it can be termed the silent killer because people can have the infection and it can be causing damage to the liver, but they're completely unaware of that, so that's why it's really crucial that we get the message out about who should be screened and tested.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis Australia CEO Lucy Clynes says understanding who's most at risk is also a crucial part of that process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that half that population are either undiagnosed, that means they don't know they are living with hepatitis or they are not connected to the care or the treatment that they need. Hepatitis is Australia's leading cause of cancer death - we have to get people connected to care and support.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIts new report poses the question - if 100 people were living with viral hepatitis, who would they be?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found 69 would be living with Hepatitis B and almost a quarter with Hepatitis C.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome can live with multiple forms.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conditions differ as do their treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis C is curable, but has no vaccine.\n\n\n\n\n\nHepatitis B has a vaccine and treatments, but no cure.\n\n\n\n\n\nEliminating viral hepatitis as a public health threat is the major goal, with almost 1,000 deaths in Australia recorded each year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government is aiming to get there by the end of the decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Hepatitis Australia wants more action, warning the current rate of progress won't reach that target.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know migrant communities are disproportionately impacted by viral hepatitis - particularly Hepatitis B. That means we have to be providing information in a range of community languages and in ways that are culturally sensitive to the needs of migrant populations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe snapshot shows 70 per cent of people affected by Hepatitis B would be born overseas, including higher rates from countries in south east Asia, where mother-to-child transmission is more common.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile more than half - 56 per cent - speak a language other than English at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nMei Mak has the experienced the stigma that can come with a diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she's urging others not to let that stop them looking out for their health.\n\n\n\n",

There's the beautiful day that we were waiting for this first six months of his life where he could hear us for the first time. That was unbelievable. We were waiting, so excited for this day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was 12 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nRafael, now 13, was diagnosed with profound hearing loss soon after birth.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd so too, were his younger brothers, 10-year-old Gabriel and six-year-old Luca.\n\n\n\nThe Sydney-based siblings all had the device implanted around the age of six months but it was just the beginning of their journey towards hearing and speaking.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile a cochlear implant can be life-changing, the technology alone is not enough, says Dr Aleisha Davis, CEO of the Shepherd Centre, a not-for-profit that helps children with hearing loss learn to listen and speak.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's such a misconception that hearing aids or cochlear implants help a child hear, but they don't. They provide access and the technology helps them hear sound, but brains aren't wired to understand sound at such early ages. So we provide the therapy that enables the children to understand what those signals are and to learn to use them in their everyday environments.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe brothers also took part in the Shepherd Centre's early intervention program.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe children are now thriving, says their mother Renata, who migrated to Australia from Brazil 17 years ago.\n\n\n\nMusic is a big part of the family's cultural identity and the two eldest boys are members of their school band.\n\n\n\n\"The program here was essential for them to thrive. You come here for maybe a day in the week, but it's all about the work that you put in every single day, exposing them to language, to sounds and music. They're doing quite well at school. They are very social little people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a decade ago that prominent Japanese hearing health specialist Doctor Akira Takagi first learnt about the work at the Shepherd Centre.\n\n\n\nHe says in Japan, children diagnosed with hearing loss who wish to receive a cochlear implant don't typically have the surgery until the age of one or two.\n\n\n\nIn Australia, it's around six months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The sooner the surgery the better the outcomes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Doctor Takagi adds there's a lack of services in Japan to teach children how to use the devices.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he was 'amazed' by the program offered by the Shepherd Centre.\n\n\n\n\"This is the system I am trying to create in Japan in collaboration with the Shepherd centre.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis month that became a reality with the launch of an early intervention pilot program.\n\n\n\n\n\nAleisha Davis says the partnership has been a decade in the making. \"I am thrilled that it's happening and that we can help many more children than those locally here in Australia. It really will change the way that children grow up learning to listen with cochlear implants in Japan.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all children born with hearing impairment use a cochlear implant.\n\n\n\nSome families opt for Auslan, while others are bilingual using both sign-language and spoken language.\n\n\n\n\n\nShirley Liu, the CEO of Deaf Australia - the main association representing deaf people in Australia - says there is a diversity of experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to SBS in Auslan, which we've translated to spoken language, she emphasises the need for access to sign language from birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not an either/or, black or white, system that you can either have access to sound or access to Auslan and they can be used in conjunction with each other. Our position is that Auslan is essential and it's a valuable and vital language for deaf children to have access to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 90 per cent of deaf children are born to hearing parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means many families are initially unfamiliar with deafness.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was the case for Liz Speilman, whose two-and-half-year-old son, Louis was diagnosed with hearing loss shortly after birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We didn't know anything about hearing loss. We don't have anyone that's deaf in our family. So it was a new world to us as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLouis, who has been fitted with a cochlear implant, has been taking part in therapy sessions at Shepherd Centre every week for the past two years.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australia's Kaden Groves has completed his set of grand tour stage wins after traversing the slippery roads to triumph on the penultimate day of the Tour de France.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian sprinter is normally renowned for fast finishes, but excelled in the tough and wet slog over the hills to claim an emotional victory from the 13-man breakaway.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Alpecin-Deceuninck rider surged ahead 16 kilometres from home and held on for his first Tour stage win and 10th at major races. The 26-year-old from the Sunshine Coast has claimed two at the Giro d'Italia and seven at the Spanish Vuelta.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe finished 54 seconds ahead of Frank van den Broek and 59 clear of Pascal Eenkhoorn, bursting into tears as he crossed the finish line in Pontarlier.\n\n\n\n\n\nGroves' first career Tour stage win was a third of this race for his Alpecin-Deceuninck team but the first since stage two, with their previous two winners, Jasper Philipsen and Mathieu van der Poel, since lost to injury and illness.\n\n\n\n\"Today we weren't sure whether to go for the stage or wait for tomorrow but when the rain falls I have a super feeling normally in the cold weather,\" an emotional Groves said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's so much pressure at the Tour, and having won in the Giro, having won in the Vuelta, all I ever get asked is am I good enough to win in the Tour? And now I show them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's my first time winning, so it's pretty incredible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in the stage, another Australian, Harrison Sweeny, had made his mark.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the front group tackled the 3.6km C\u00f4te de Th\u00e9sy, Frenchman Jordan Jegat launched a solo attack, but he was then overtaken by Sweeny.\n\n\n\nKaden Groves celebrates on the podium after winning a Tour de France stage for the first time. Source: AP / Mosa'ab Elshamy As rain fell heavily again after 40km, Sweeny opened up a 50-second lead, only to be quickly reeled in.\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from the Australian cameos, Poga\u010dar kept things safe to maintain his healthy lead over arch-rival Vingegard and set the stage for a triumphant finale into Paris on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Slovenian ace has a 4 minutes 24 seconds advantage over two-time Tour winner Vingegaard with Germany's Florian Lipowitz 11:03 behind Poga\u010dar in third overall.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarring a dramatic misadventure, Poga\u010dar should complete the job on Sunday (local time) and move level with British rider Chris Froome on four Tour titles.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictory would also give Poga\u010dar a fifth Grand Tour after winning the Giro d'Italia in dominant fashion last year.\n\n\n\nHowever, Sunday's final stage is not a processional one, as is usually the case, and could potentially prove troublesome toward the end with three consecutive climbs.\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday's 184.2km route from Nantua through eastern France featured three small climbs and a moderately difficult one up C\u00f4te de Th\u00e9sy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wet roads were treacherous at high speeds, with France's Romain Gr\u00e9goire and Spaniard Iv\u00e1n Romeo both crashing as they attempted to navigate tight turns. Both were able to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final stage is a 132.3km ride from Mantes-la-Jolie to Paris, where the peloton will cycle up the famous Butte Montmartre three times before the final laps on the Champs-Elysees.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Agreeing to buy energy from the US was a no-brainer for the EU and Japan, given their reliance on imported energy. The EU, which ended its purchases of Russian gas after the invasion of Ukraine, now imports about half its LNG from the US. LNG is a commodity traded at global market prices, so there is no financial penalty for the EU in sourcing more gas from the US. Perversely, however, there could be an adverse impact on the US - its increased exports of LNG in recent years have flowed through to higher US domestic gas prices. The deals that may underpin this new global trade order have been hastily and clumsily negotiated, are half-formed and have unintended consequences for American companies, consumers and the US economy. The promise, if there is one, to invest $US600 billion in the US was vague and one whose delivery is beyond the EU\u2019s control. It is individual European companies that would have to decide whether or not to invest. Unlike the deal with Japan, where Trump claimed the Japanese would invest $US550 billion in a fund from which the US would get 90 per cent of the profits, the investment agreement with the EU appears just a broad statement of intent.\n\nTrump and his administration have a tendency to over-egg their accomplishments. The Japanese version of what they have agreed to, for instance, varies significantly from what Trump has described. The Japanese have agreed to provide equity, loans and loan guarantees for investments in the US, but government officials say any profits would be split according to the level of contributions made and that the final degree of profit-sharing would rest with the private sector companies involved and the returns they required. It would appear the Japanese envisage their state agencies mainly facilitating debt funding for US projects, with the decisions on which projects to pursue and the apportionment of profits left to the Japanese and US companies involved. Trump said Japan would invest, \u201cat my discretion,\u201d the $US550 billion but, as is the case with the EU, he can\u2019t force Japanese companies to invest.\n\nIt should be noted that the presentation card on Trump\u2019s desk that outlined the investment agreement originally said Japan would invest $US400 billion, but the \u201c$400B\u201d was crossed out with a marker pen (a Sharpie, perhaps) and altered to $US500 billion. When Trump announced the detail, in a post on Truth Social, it had suddenly become $US550 billion. It is unclear whether the Japanese were consulted on the revisions. What that episode demonstrates is how rushed the trade deals have been as the administration tries to demonstrate that the threat of Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs has been successful in forcing other countries to accept Trump\u2019s terms before the 90-day delay before those tariffs are imposed expires on August 1. That\u2019s why there are obvious blank pages in the EU and Japanese deals to be filled in before they remotely resemble a fully-detailed trade agreement.\n\nIt\u2019s also why, as is the case with Australia\u2019s recent decision to allow more imports of American processed beef, the outcome of the agreements will depend, not on what Trump decrees or the EU and Japanese trade negotiators have agreed to, but on companies and consumers within the markets that the US says it is opening up. The Japanese won\u2019t buy any meaningful volume of US SUVs and pick-up trucks. There is no market for them in Japan and the American auto companies aren\u2019t going to re-tool in order to produce a few gas-guzzling right-hand drive vehicles. Trump mused that the Europeans would enjoy those SUVs and pick-ups. He doesn\u2019t appreciate that there are significant cultural differences between Europeans and Americans and that it is improbable that the narrow and congested streetscapes in European cities are suddenly going to be littered with over-sized US vehicles. Trump doesn\u2019t appreciate that there are significant cultural differences between Europeans and Americans and that it is improbable that the narrow and congested streetscapes in European cities are suddenly going to be littered with over-sized US vehicles. Credit: iStock The 15 per cent tariff on European auto and auto part exports is, however, a big win for the Europeans, as were the same tariff concessions won by the Japanese.\n\nThe EU and Japanese carmakers don\u2019t face tariffs on their raw materials, like steel and aluminium, or components. Their US counterparts, which are heavily integrated into a North American auto industry, with cars and components flowing across the borders with Mexico and Canada, do. Thanks to Trump, who has imposed 25 per cent duties on imports of steel, aluminium, auto parts and those components of US autos not made within the US, the European and Japanese companies will have a material competitive advantage over America\u2019s own carmakers. The fact that the two key trading partners, both heavily reliant on the auto industry, were able to win such advantages for their companies says that, in its haste to proclaim that Trump\u2019s tariffs threats have produced results, the administration hasn\u2019t looked at the complex ways the deals interact with America\u2019s own industries and their supply chains. It does seem rather bizarre that Trump is using the threat of punitive tariffs to bludgeon other countries into trade deals that gives their key industries what is effectively a tariff advantage over his own. He and his advisers also don\u2019t appear to appreciate that allowing tariff-free imports of products from the US is irrelevant if consumers aren\u2019t going to buy what the US is selling or, as is the case with the 100 Boeing aircraft that Japan agreed to buy, if the US companies can\u2019t deliver what the countries have agreed to buy. Boeing\u2019s current backlog of orders is about 6000 planes, or nearly 17 years of production at the rate at which it delivered planes last year.",

Alphington is quite resilient,\u201d he said.\n\nLoading \u201cIt is an interesting pocket of Melbourne with a lot of families and more family homes. It is less dense than other areas of the inner north, but you still have access to all the things in the area.\u201d The property was one of 752 scheduled for auction in Melbourne in the past week. By Saturday evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 75.8 per cent from 557 reported results, while 44 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate. A three-level townhouse in Eltham designed by renowned architect Graeme Gunn sold under the hammer for $1.41 million on Saturday. The home at 2/93 Arthur Street was advertised with a reserve of $1,300,000, which selling agent Tom Kurtschenko from Jellis Craig said \u201cwas part of the strategy going into the auction\u201d.\n\nPositioned at the highest point of Eltham, the home is a part of the gated Kinloch Estate, which was established in 2000. The property\u2019s treetop and city views on the upper level, along with its three bedrooms and thoughtfully crafted layout, attracted two active bidders, both local families, to the area. \u201cThe two bidders went toe to toe,\u201d Kurtschenko said. \u201cIt got a run on, and it was a pretty clean auction and got to where it needed to.\u201d\n\nLoading The successful bidders want to do some improvements to bring the home back to its former glory, Kurtschenko said. \u201cIt\u2019s a 25-year-old home, and it\u2019s just showing its age a little bit,\u201d he said. Stock markets in the local market were \u201cvery low\u201d, the agent said. \u201cLocally in Eltham and Eltham North, there are 75 homes up for sale, which is well down. It usually trends at around 110 to 130 homes, so it is notably down, so I think that\u2019s putting pressure on what\u2019s on the market,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, in Mornington, a deceased estate located in an ex-housing commission area fetched $815,000 at auction, above its reserve of $690,000. 13 Carramar Street originally had a price guide of $610,000-$670,000, which was increased in week two of the campaign to $640,000-$680,000, said selling agent James Stamatopoulos of Ray White Frankston. \u201cGiven the amount of interest we had, we wanted to make the price guide more transparent,\u201d he said. The auction drew four bidders, a diverse mix of aspiring first home buyers, downsizers, investors and developers.\n\nLoading The underbidders were downsizers who wanted to relocate from the city, and the successful bidders were investors from Sydney. \u201cWe are seeing more interstate investor interest in this pocket,\u201d said Stamatopoulos. \u201cThere\u2019s great value here and buyers are responding.\u201d For the sellers, the sale was bittersweet.",
