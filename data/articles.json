        "text": "President Donald Trump took to social media before meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung to threaten not to do business with Seoul because of a \u201cPurge or Revolution\u201d that he claimed was taking place in the country.\n\nBut any prospect of a hostile Oval Office meeting evaporated after Lee heaped praise onto the US president \u2014 lauding the decor, beseeching Trump to continue to help with Korean peace efforts and even suggesting a Trump Tower in North Korea.\n\n\u201cWe've known each other and gotten along very well,\u201d Trump said, before adding: \u201cIt's a great honour to be with you and congratulations on your election. That was a big one, and we're with you 100 per cent.\u201d\n\nThe Oval Office has been decked out with gold decor in Donald Trump's second term. (AP)\n\nThe cordial display showed how world leaders are taking notes from previous meetings between Trump and heads of state, who've largely chosen the route of praise and adulation rather than confrontation as they seek favourable trade terms and continued military aid from Washington.\n\nIt was one of the first big foreign policy tests for Lee, who took over a country in a state of political turmoil since its former leader, Yoon Suk Yeol, was ousted from office after imposing martial law .\n\nLee, elected in June, began by praising one of Trump's pet projects: presidential interior design.\n\n\u201cI heard that you recently redecorated the Oval Office, and I would like to say that it looks very bright and beautiful,\u201d Lee said through an interpreter. \u201cIt has the dignity of America, and it symbolises the new future and prosperity of America.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the Dow Jones index has reached record highs (although Lee made sure to add the caveat that \u201cit went down a bit\u201d) and asked Trump, who has been on a mission to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, to reunify the two Koreas and even perhaps see the construction of a Trump Tower in North Korea accompanied by a round of golf.\n\n\n\nLee also agreed with Trump's assertion that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would not have continued to enhance his nuclear capabilities the last few years had Trump remained in office.\n\nNoting a \u201crenaissance\u201d that is taking place, Lee said, \u201cI believe you are the only leader who has made such accomplishments.\u201d\n\nWhat happened in South Korea\n\nThe tone was a far cry from Trump's confrontational social media post earlier on Monday.\n\nHe later elaborated that he was referring to raids on churches and on a US military base by the new South Korean government, which they \u201cprobably shouldn't have done.\"\n\n\u201cI heard bad things,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday morning. \u201cI don't know if it's true or not. I'll be finding out.\u201d\n\nTrump did not identify specific raids. But earlier this month, South Korean police raided a church led by a conservative activist pastor who authorities allege is connected to a riot by Yoon\u2019s supporters at a Seoul court in January, after it issued an arrest warrant for him.\n\nA special prosecutor\u2019s team that is investigating corruption allegations against Yoon\u2019s arrested wife, former first lady Kim Keon Hee, also raided the facilities of the Unification Church over allegations that one of its officials gave her luxury goods.\n\nSouth Korean President Lee Jae Myung meets with Donald Trump in the Oval Office. (AP)\n\nMeanwhile, Osan Air Base, which is jointly operated by the United States and South Korea, was also the target of a raid last month by investigators looking into how Yoon\u2019s activation of martial law transpired. South Korean investigators stressed the search was limited to areas controlled by Seoul and did not involve US military operations.\n\nAsked about his assertions by a reporter in front of Lee, Trump declined to confront the South Korean president and instead said the two will discuss it later.\n\n\u201cIt didn't sound to me like South Korea,\u201d Trump said.\n\nLee explained that the special prosecutor was tapped by the country's National Assembly to investigate the actions of Yoon, who Lee said staged a \u201cself-coup.\u201d\n\nAt that point, Trump interjected, \u201cIs his name Deranged Jack Smith, by any chance?\u201d He was referring to the special prosecutor who led two criminal cases against Trump before the Republican president was reelected to a second term.\n\nYoon, who was elected to a five-year term in 2022, was considered more ideologically aligned with Trump and had even taken up golfing again after the U.S. president was reelected last November to try to forge a bond with him.\n\nLee led the South Korean parliament's efforts to overturn Yoon's martial law decree while impeaching him. The nation's Constitutional Court formally dismissed Yoon in April.\n\nThe new president\n\nElected in June, Lee was a former child laborer with an arm deformity who rose his way through South Korea\u2019s political ranks to lead the liberal Democratic Party and win the presidency after multiple attempts.\n\nAt a subsequent remarks in Washington on Monday night, Lee suggested that Trump's post had been \u201cthreatening\u201d and said it had him worried he might face a \u201cZelenksyy moment\" \u2014 similar to when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was hounded out of the Oval Office by Trump and Vice President JD Vance following a contentious meeting in February.\n\nBut Lee also said the South Korean-US relationship was strong enough that he was confident Trump wouldn't work to undermine it. Instead, he said the pair had \u201cvery good conversations\u201d that went \u201cbeyond my expectations\" and took longer than originally scheduled.\n\n\u201cEverybody gave me the advice to have patience,\u201d Lee said of his meeting with Trump.\n\nHe said he also told Trump that South Korea would increase its defence spending, even as it works to ease tensions between his country and North Korea.\n\nSouth Korean troops march during a celebration to mark the 75th anniversary of Armed Forces Day. (AP)\n\n\u201cWe will increase our defence budget, which will be used to transform the Korean military into a smart military that will prevail in future,\u201d Lee said.\n\nLee said he and Trump also discussed modernising their countries' trade relations, which follows a July deal that has Seoul investing hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S. That agreement set tariffs on South Korean goods at 15 per cent after Trump threatened rates as high as 25 per cent.\n\nSeoul has one of the largest trade surpluses among Washington\u2019s NATO and Indo-Pacific allies, and countries where the US holds a trade deficit has drawn particular ire from Trump, who wants to eliminate such trade imbalances.\n\nTrump also said Monday that he\u2019d like to scrap the US lease with South Korea that covers Osan Air Base and instead get ownership of the land.\n\nREAD MORE: Australia Post suspends deliveries to the US after Trump tariffs",

(Supplied: Brendan Cullen)\n\nMr Gregory joined Mr Cullen's family in the boat to cheer him on.\n\nPushing through discomfort and fatigue as the swim went on, Mr Cullen was jubilant when he made it to shore in LA.\n\n\"My shoulders took a bit of a belting,\" he said.\n\n\" Probably the last three hours my shoulder packed it in, so I had to change up my swimming stroke. \"\n\nBut he was determined not to quit, and recalled thinking: \"There's no way in hell I'm getting out.\"\n\nNot just about swimming\n\nMr Cullen has been a champion for mental health awareness \u2014 he has battled his own illness in the past and is an advocate across western NSW.\n\nSo the grazier thought it would be good to raise awareness and money for not-for-profit Find Ya Feet, which runs workshops in schools and sporting clubs about vulnerability.\n\n\"School's a tough place to be, especially if you don't want to be there \u2026 and [so I] figured it would be an awesome thing to do to raise a few bucks,\" Mr Cullen said.\n\nFind Ya Feet's founder and chief executive, Tom Herschell, said it was Mr Cullen who first reached out because he wanted to help.\n\n\"Anyone who swims out in the Menindee Lakes in the middle of winter when it's as cold as a mother-in-law's kiss has got plenty of front, which I bloody love,\" Mr Herschell said.\n\n\"[He's] just a beautiful man with a beautiful heart and has a vision, and he's a doer.\"",

        "text": "For many Australians, our first contact with official dietary guidelines was the food pyramid, which had fruit, veggies, and carbs as its base, and fats and sugar at the very top.\n\nOver the decades, the various blocks that made up the food pyramid shifted slightly. It recently got a makeover and is now the \"healthy eating plate\".\n\nLoading...\n\nBut the plate is based on guidelines published back in 2013, which are due for an update. They're currently under revision to take into account the latest nutrition research, and are expected to be published next year.\n\nWhile we don't know what the new guidelines will say, we can look overseas to see what the latest dietary guidelines of other countries include.\n\nAnd one issue pops up time and again: the health of the environment.\n\nSustainability in newer dietary guidelines\n\nOver the past five years or so, new dietary recommendations from elsewhere around the world haven't just addressed human health \u2014 they've incorporated the health of the planet too.\n\nProduction of certain food groups, such as red meat, have a relatively higher environmental impact \u2014 on carbon emissions, land use and biodiversity loss \u2014 than others.\n\nIn 2019, a group of researchers, called the EAT-Lancet Commission, published the planetary health diet. It's designed to be adapted for different countries and cultures, and is a \"plant-forward\" diet, where most foods are whole grains, fruit, vegetables, nuts and legumes.\n\nHow to get the fibre you need Photo shows Smiling girl with glasses eating apple and looking at laptop. People share a lot of their lives on social media. This can even include digestion details, with content about \"staying regular\", bloating and fibre far from off-limits.\n\nWhile red meat is not off the table, the planetary health diet suggests people eat no more than 98 grams of red meat each week.\n\n\"That's about a third of what the current Australian Guide to Healthy Eating recommends,\" Jessica Danaher, a RMIT University dietitian and nutrition scientist, says.\n\nThe Danish dietary guidelines, published in 2020, also emphasise climate-friendly, plant-rich eating. They suggest people eat less meat, and choose fish and legumes instead.\n\nOther sets of dietary guidelines also explicitly incorporate environmental sustainability, but not all. Norway's guidelines, while being similar to the Danish guidelines, don't mention the environment at all (but do suggest people \"eat with pleasure and make time to sit down and eat\").\n\nSo will we see a focus on planetary health in the next iteration of the Australian Dietary Guidelines?\n\nDr Danaher suspects so: \"[We may be] shifting towards looking at health from a more holistic perspective as opposed to just looking at the clinical perspective or nutritional adequacy.\"\n\nWhat are the current Australian dietary guidelines?\n\nYou may be wondering what our current recommendations even are.\n\nThey include recommendations about breastfeeding and food safety, but mostly focus on people eating a variety of nutritious foods.\n\nThe visual representation of our guidelines is called the Australian guide to healthy eating plate, and it's divvied up into five food groups.\n\nThe five food groups include vegetables, fruit, grain, protein and dairy. (Getty Images: fcafotodigital)\n\nWhat is a 'serve'? Vegetables: half a cup cooked green or orange vegetables, 1 cup raw salad vegetables, or 1 medium tomato\n\nFruit: 1 medium apple, two small plums, or 1 cup canned fruit (no added sugar)\n\nGrain (cereal) food: 1 slice of bread, half a cup cooked rice, pasta or noodles, or quarter of a cup muesli\n\nProtein: 65 grams cooked lean red meat, 2 large eggs, or 1 cup cooked or canned legumes\n\nDairy: 1 cup fresh milk or calcium-enriched plant-based milk, 2 slices of cheese, or three quarters of a cup yoghurt\n\nRecommended daily minimum serves of these five food groups vary with age and sex Source: Eat For Health\n\nIt comprises around a third of grain-based foods, a third veggies and legumes, and the rest split roughly between fruit, lean protein, and dairy and dairy-alternatives.\n\n\"Discretionary foods\" such as chips, chocolate, cream and soft drinks are recommended to be eaten \"sometimes and in small amounts\".\n\nDespite being portrayed as a single meal, the healthy eating plate is not designed to show you what you should be eating every meal, Dr Danaher says.\n\n\" It's not so much about ticking that off every single day, but more of what it looks like, say, over the space of a few days or a week. \"\n\nFor instance, the guidelines recommend no more than two serves of \"discretionary foods\" every day.\n\n\"One quarter of a pie at the footy is a serve of discretionary foods, so my whole pie is doubling the daily recommendations,\" Dr Danaher says.\n\n\"But I'm not going to eat half my pie and chuck it in the bin and go, 'Oh, I've met my pie limit for today'.\n\n\"I'll have that whole pie, but I'm not eating a pie every single day.\"\n\nHow many people meet the current Australian dietary guidelines?\n\nThe fruit and vegetable sections recommend people aged nine years or older eat two serves of fruit and at least five serves of vegetables every day.\n\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, only 4.2 per cent of Australian adults met the recommended targets for both fruit and vegetables in 2022.\n\nThat may seem incredibly low, but the Australian dietary guidelines are just that \u2014 guidelines, Dr Danaher says.\n\nAussie to eat more junk by 2030, study finds Photo shows A close of a woman's mouth as she eats a donut with pink frosting, sprinkles and a rainbow-coloured lolly on it. The CSIRO says the average Australian's diet is likely to get worse within five years, hurting our health and the taxpayers' purse. So what is standing in the way of better eating?\n\n\"It's called the Australian guide to healthy eating, not the Australian rule book to healthy eating.\n\n\"It's to give us a sense of proportion, variety and moderation for a nutritional balanced approach \u2026 it gives us something to aim towards.\n\n\"Realistically, with real-world, everyday eating, people have things like travel and social events, appetite, your time, what you're able to eat between work commitments, cost, availability and even stress playing a big role.\"\n\nFor more on dietary guidelines, check out the full episode of Lab Notes.",

And it is definitely the case that in Victoria, retail crime is escalating more than what we are seeing in other states.\u201d\n\nRetailers are increasingly coming forward to call out the worsening issue as punching a hole in sales and putting the safety of front-line staff at risk.\n\nDan Murphy\u2019s and BWS has implemented body-worn cameras and augmented technology to help train staff, while Rebel Sport\u2019s margins have been dented by the persistent thievery.\n\nLiquor merchants Dan Murphy\u2019s and BWS say they are grappling with organised theft.

Its grocery business grew sales by 4.3 per cent to nearly $40 billion as Coles focused on fewer, deeper promotions and locked in everyday low prices on a broad range of products during the year.\n\nWeckert said a focus on quality, value for money, availability and customer experience improved customer-experience metrics, resulting in bigger basket sizes and numbers of transactions. Investors also celebrated the result, sending Coles\u2019 share price 8.1 per cent higher.\n\nAs interest rates fall, the supermarket chief is watching to see how cost-conscious customers will respond, with behaviours like cutting back on treats, cross-shopping and using loyalty points currently still \u201cin play\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re seeing those green shoots around sentiment. The question is going to be: when do we start to see some of the behaviour change and catch up with that? The timing on that is a bit unclear on this,\u201d Weckert told reporters on Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cAs we head into the summer months and we head into Christmas, that will be something we\u2019ll keep a strong eye on because I think that will be the pull for customers to start to return to some of their behaviours around going out a bit more and catching up with friends at the park or at a restaurant.\u201d",

She\u2019s very glad he did. \u201cHe said, \u2018Let\u2019s have a chat. I\u2019m not sure what this would be like, but how about you come up to Lombadina and see my Country, and we\u2019ll go from there\u2019. So I went to Lombadina and met his elders and the leaders in this community. And we talked about who I was, what I wanted to do, Bangarra \u2013 you know, not everyone has seen or knows Bangarra, when you live in a community.\u201d Cured trout at Yarra Botanica Credit: Chris Hopkins Bangarra has a cultural and creative cycle to ensure that at every stage of a work\u2019s development, the company is working with community and has consent and permission from the people whose stories they are telling. Having secured permission from the elders in Sibosado\u2019s community, Rings returned to Lombadina in February of this year with lighting designer Damien Cooper, set designer Charles Davis and composer Brendon Boney. They woke with the sun and spent their days learning from the land. \u201cIt\u2019s being guided through that Country and given that insight. And really changing your observation from your city eyes to having bush eyes, which takes a couple of days. And not listening, not seeing and listening with the head, but it has to come from an internal feeling that\u2019s a different experience altogether.\u201d\n\nShe says the entire process in Lombadina took about a week. Was there pressure to deliver in that short time, I asked her? \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Bangarra Dance Theatre\u2019s production Illume. Credit: Daniel Boud But she\u2019s been preparing for this kind of creative endeavour her entire life. \u201cI knew what I wanted to be when I was five years old,\u201d she says. \u201cDance is my first language. I was a dreamer, an imaginer, and would be found in the backyard creating my own world, creating these theatrical productions.\u201d The first professional production she ever saw was Cats at Sydney\u2019s Theatre Royal as a year 11 HSC dance student. \u201cIt was transformative and confirmed that that\u2019s the direction that I wanted to go,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was fascinating for me that you could take people on a journey just through the movements of the body, through this language of movement.\u201d\n\nWhen she arrived at NAISDA at the age of 17, she initially wanted to do ballet. \u201cBut I found out pretty quickly that that ship has sailed,\u201d she says. That was disappointment number one, the first of several key setbacks that made her the dancer and artist she is. She refocused her attention from ballet to modern dance and forged a connection to her Indigenous heritage through the medium. \u201cWhat I saw at NAISDA was that you could express your identity, or your challenges, or the complications of being a First Nations young person trying to find themselves and balancing lots of different issues.\u201d Frances Rings\u2019 latest work is a collaboration with a visual storyteller, the first in Bangarra\u2019s history. Credit: Chris Hopkins Rings found NAISDA transformative not just culturally and artistically, but also politically. \u201cWe turned up in 1988, the year at the Bicentenary ... Carole Johnson [NAISDA and Bangarra founder] came in with the other leaders of NAISDA at the time said, \u2018There\u2019s a big march going on, we\u2019re cancelling classes. We\u2019re all heading to Redfern. We\u2019re marching to Hyde Park\u2019.\u201d Stephen Page worked with NAISDA students on a Bangarra production while Rings was at the school, and she desperately wanted to be cast in it. She wasn\u2019t. Disappointment number two.\n\n\u201cI was devastated,\u201d she admits. \u201cAnd I thought, I\u2019m just going to use this disappointment as a motivation to just keep working and set some new goals.\u201d Baked scallop at Yarra Botanica Credit: Chris Hopkins When she graduated she auditioned for Bangarra to join the company and was put on a traineeship. \u201cStephen was very strict, and it was, \u2018you\u2019re a trainee, so you should just watch, take in what these senior artists and cultural leaders are going to teach you\u2019. \u201cAs a graduate, you\u2019re feeling on top, and then you drop to the bottom again. It was extremely humbling to be in that kind of environment where you have to listen, you have to observe, you have to wait, you\u2019ve got to be patient.\u201d Rings was patient \u2013 to a point. But she really wanted to get out on stage. Her big break came in Melbourne, where the company was performing at the Arts Centre. But it also came with disappointment number three.\n\n\u201cI was understudying some of the roles from Praying Mantis Dreaming, Stephen\u2019s first full-length work, and one of the dancers got injured. It was a matinee, and Stephen said, \u2018You\u2019re on. This is it\u2019. And he said, \u2018Do you know it?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah, I think so\u2019. We had no videos back then, so I was learning it backstage. It was a big learning experience \u2013 you\u2019ve got to be ready to go when he says go.\u201d Terrified backstage, Rings threw up a few times, and then it was showtime. \u201cI went on stage, forgot all the choreography, made up my own choreography. When I came off-stage, I was just beside myself. I thought, \u2018oh my God, Sis, you don\u2019t have a job any more\u2019.\u201d But Page was impressed that she\u2019d covered so well. \u201cHe let me have it, like, what was that? So I got a big dressing down. But [he also said], \u2018well, you got on and you kept going and you covered it. So you\u2019re lucky that you still have a job\u2019.\u201d She never did that again, always making sure she truly knew every part in the show. \u201cIt was learning by falling over and getting back up again. And I felt like I did that my whole life.\u201d\n\nNow that she\u2019s the artistic director of the company, she makes sure she pays plenty of attention to the understudies. \u201cWhen I\u2019m holding rehearsals and I see the dancers, and I always watch on the side who\u2019s understudying, who\u2019s covering, and I\u2019ve got my list in front of me. I know who\u2019s supposed to be doing which role, and if I see that they\u2019re not, I could pull them to the side and say something, but it\u2019s a lesson a dancer needs to learn on their own journey.\u201d Loading Mentorship is a hugely important part of what she does with Bangarra, and Rings says she wants her up-and-coming dancers to learn the lessons she did \u2013 though perhaps not to invent their own choreography on stage. \u201cThey\u2019d be like, \u2018well, you did it!\u2019\u201d she laughs. Her dancers all know the story, and yes, they all think it\u2019s hilarious.",

Not all Australia Post parcels will be affected.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe change will primarily affect Australian businesses that are selling to American customers, or Australians sending over expensive presents to loved ones across the ocean.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Australia spared tariff hike as Donald Trump raises rates for 92 nations SBS News 06:51 English\n\nThe temporary suspension will impact businesses shipping goods to retail customers in the US, including those using MyPost Business and Business Contract.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will affect many Australian e-commerce retailers, with some needing to make the decision overnight to halt serving customers in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdinary letters and documents, as well as gifts valued under US$100 ($153), are unaffected by the change.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means that if you're planning on sending a loved one an Aussie care package with Vegemite and Tim Tams, you'll want to make sure that it's valued under $153.\n\n\n\nWhy is Australia Post suspending parcels to the US?\n\nThe action being taken is in response to the US government's imposition of customs and import tariff rules for parcels sent to the US, Australia Post said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration is set to change customs rules for parcels. Until now, low-value packages heading to the US were subject to the \"De Minimis\" exemption \u2014 which allows parcels and goods valued below US$800 (about $1,200) to enter the country duty-free.\n\n\n\nAs of 29 August, that rule will be suspended, with parcels subject to the tariff imposed on that country.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian goods are subject to the baseline 10 per cent tariff.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia Post's temporary partial suspension also includes parcels to Puerto Rico, as it is a US customs territory and has also been impacted by tariff changes.\n\n\n\nWhat other countries have done the same?\n\nAustralia Post says its action is in line with other postal operators globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nPostal services across Europe have already suspended most parcel shipments to the US, including France's La Poste, Germany's Deutsche Post, Spain's Correos, Poste Italiane and the Belgian, Swedish and Danish postal services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustria's \u00d6sterreichische Post and the United Kingdom's Royal Mail are expected to stop sending parcels to the US by the end of August.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Australia Post is working with Zonos, an authorised US Customs and Border Protection third-party provider, on a solution for business customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nGary Starr, Australia Post's executive general manager of parcels, post and e-commerce services, said: \"We are disappointed we have had to take this action; however, due to the complex and rapidly evolving situation, a temporary partial suspension has been necessary to allow us to develop and implement a workable solution for our customers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia Post continues to work with US and Australian authorities and international postal partners to resume postal service to the US as a priority,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhat's the reaction been?\n\nIt's believed Australian businesses will still be able to send parcels to the US through more expensive commercial models like DHL and FedEx.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this might not be viable for many Australian businesses, who have announced they'll be suspending shipping to the US and Puerto Rico immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Just, a bespoke fountain pen maker from Brisbane, said he has had to suspend sales to the US \"effective immediately\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's still unclear at this stage what exactly is going to happen and if Australia Post can come up with a solution to this anytime soon. So I have no choice but to suspend sales until more information becomes available,\" he wrote on his business's Instagram page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My only other option currently for international shipping is DHL, the shipping cost starts at $55 AUD or $65 ... for some addresses into the US it can be as much as $120 AUD.\"\n\n\n\nNatural Fibre Arts, a hand-dyed yarn business based in Perth, was forced to expedite orders before the changes took place. Now, they've needed to pause new orders from the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth businesses said if they continue shipping to the US, the tariff would need to be paid to the US Customs and Border Protection before the product enters the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian book small business, Beyond The Pages, said it was \"doing everything to minimise the impact, including declaring the lowest possible parcel values\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for now, it's a state of limbo for many Australian businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

Source: Getty / TkKurikawa University of Tasmania, communities and social justice associate professor, Catherine Robinson told SBS News she was hopeful the release of this data would prompt action as child homelessness in Australia had been \"invisibilised\" until now.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data that has been released had not been broken down this way previously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"AIHW has traditionally only reported and referred to \u2018young people\u2019 as being unaccompanied, and have reported on \u2018children's homelessness\u2019 and included that as part of children who might be homeless with their parents,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So this is a really significant moment in which one of our lead national institutions is finally properly recognising that children are experiencing homelessness without a parent or guardian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's the first time that they've done a standalone report and used that language of 'unaccompanied homeless children,' and that they've isolated the records around that cohort,\" Robinson said.\n\n\n\nAssociate professor in communities and social justice at the University of Tasmania Catherine Robinson has welcomed the release of this data from the Australian Institute of Health and Wellbeing. Source: Supplied / Richard J Ho, Minch Media She said this had influenced people's perception of homelessness in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They think about young people, and they might assume, well, they might be over 18, they might have access to independent income, they can apply for a rental.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What's been happening is we've had this situation where all of this discussion of youth homelessness has actually 'invisibilised,' for want of a better word, the specific issue of children's homelessness, and it's let governments and community off the hook,\" Robinson said.\n\n\n\nFactors influencing and the trauma of child homelessness\n\nUnderwood said for Home Base staff \"the biggest issue by far that we see is family breakdown and family domestic and sexual violence is the reason young people turn up\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is also what the AIHW data has shown, with 42 per cent of unaccompanied children identifying interpersonal relationships as the main reason for seeking assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These young people are homeless because their homes, where their parents are, are not safe places,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderwood described how experiencing homelessness as a child could cause further trauma.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said once a child experienced unaccompanied homelessness, they were exposed to other young people and situations \u201cthat they probably shouldn\u2019t be\".\n\n\n\nHome Base chief executive officer Di Underwood says staff within the Tasmanian-based service dealt with unaccompanied children who were experiencing homelessness, as young as 10 years old. Source: Supplied Robinson said there was a shortage of crisis care available for children to access, and \"if our governments don't want to provide safe accommodation for our children, there are other people in the community who do provide that accommodation, and they're not the kind of people that we'd want children to be staying with.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That could include violent peers and exploitative partners, it's very common for girls, you might have a 14-year-old staying with their 19 or even 24-year-old boyfriend and they're completely dependent on that young man for their accommodation, so lots of girls report absolutely horrific intimate partner violence because they're entirely trapped,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"Then you have criminal networks who might offer kids a place to crash in exchange for helping them move drugs, something I definitely see in my research.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRobinson said there was a \"fundamental misunderstanding\" of the role government child protection departments play with homeless children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a highly residualised and specialist service; it is not universally available, you have to meet particular evidenced and legally prosecuted grounds to be removed [from a home] and provided with alternative care in the out-of-home care sector,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to see that that process is extremely rigorous, I'm not suggesting it shouldn't be, but that tells you that there's a particular threshold and definition of which children will be offered out-of-home care, homelessness in itself does not ensure a child meets the threshold for a child protection response,\" Robinson said.\n\n\n\nStatistics only show part of the problem\n\nShe said the number of unaccompanied children experiencing homelessness was likely far higher than the 13,301 accounted for in the AIHW statistics, as it only showed the number of children who presented to services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If those relevant services don't exist in many states and territories, then clearly you're not getting the number of children in Australia who are experiencing this,\" Robinson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRobinson said only Tasmania and New South Wales \"provide significant shelter accommodation in the specialised homeless service system for homeless children\".\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, whilst she said the data provided \"a great indicator, it's not a representation of the reality of this issue\".\n\n\n\nAddressing child homelessness\n\nRobison said, \u201cwhat we need is a very distinct conversation about what unaccompanied child homelessness is, and what drives it, as distinct from adult homelessness.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said while housing stock would be playing a role in overall homelessness, \"when we talk about unaccompanied child homelessness, we are talking about very different main drivers of that homelessness, which is really around family conflict, relationship breakdown, abuse, neglect and violence.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In terms of thinking about what does a good response look like? It's not about housing affordability, it's about family support, addressing family poverty.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRobinson said early intervention mechanisms, particularly in schools and health services were required for the early identification of families and children individually who might be struggling and \"on a pathway to having to exit home early because those family relationships are broken down\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The 'damaging' hidden crisis affecting thousands of Australian children\n\nHomelessness Australia wants to see a national action plan on child homelessness.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organisation's chief executive Kate Colvin said systems that identified children at risk need to be established.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Put in place the protections so they don't become homeless, but also deliver rapid responses to children if they do become homeless, so that they immediately have a safe environment and the support they need to find a pathway into a safe home and with the care that they need,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is currently developing a housing and homelessness plan, which had been expected to be released by now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not clear that they'll identify child homelessness as a separate issue and with a separate response within that overall plan,\" Colvin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we're calling for is within that plan that children who are homeless be separately identified and separate systems put in place to respond to them, because the responses are really different.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said while homelessness in terms of adults was about having physical housing stock and providing the support for individuals to be able to manage a tenancy \"when we're talking about children who are homeless, particularly young children, it's about providing a pathway for them into an environment where they're getting the care they need, you can't set a 13 year old up in a tenancy.\"\n\n\n\nPoor outcomes for children experiencing homelessness\n\nOf the unaccompanied children who sought support, just 19 per cent were able to escape homelessness during the period they were accessing such services.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso part of the AIHW data release were statistics that showed children who received support from an SHS accounted for one in 13 deaths among Australian children from 2012-13 to 2022-23.\n\n\n\n\n\nColvin said this highighted the \"shocking risks\" that children face when they are homeless.\n\n\n\nHomelessness Australia chief executive Kate Colvin wants to see a national action plan on child homelessness created to address the issue affecting thousands of Australian children every year. Source: Supplied \"Before they've come to a homeless service, generally, they've had really traumatic experiences, then they come into homelessness, and often have further traumatic experiences of not getting the help they need around violence and exploitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Devastating mental health outcomes are a consequence of that, we can see that in the deaths report where we've lost 520 children in 10 years, that's about one a week, and the leading cause of death is suicide,\" she said.\n\n\n\n",

During that time, I've gotten behind in filing taxes. When the call came, it says the A-T-O is going to prosecute you for not filing tax returns. And that there had to be money today to show good faith.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJulian says his scammer was a master of psychological manipulation - using his shame to lure him buying gift cards to show his good faith.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also kept Julian talking to them over the phone, to ensure he completed the payment without thinking about it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe found out it was a scam when it was too late.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It took five minutes for me to call the A-T-O and confirm what the scammers say is false.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, Julian has joined the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission - or the A-Triple-C - to alert fellow Australians of scam threats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you are in a heightened emotional state in the financial situation like that, give yourself five minutes, to stop, check and protect yourself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJulian's message comes as the national consumer watchdog has released a new report on Australians reporting scams.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt shows that while the number of reports of scams are down compared to last year, there was a 40.5 per cent increase of reports that involve financial losses.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the number is higher among two demographic groups, according to A-triple-C Deputy Chair Catriona Lowe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For culturally and linguistically diverse Australians, that number was 44 per cent increase in reports involving losses, and for First Nations Australians it's 55.3 per cent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Lowe says online shopping is the most common type of scam, and they are getting more sophisticated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Gone are the days we could look for the obvious spelling errors or the very, very basic website, we are seeing highly sophisticated spoof websites, very good fake advertisements and some pretty convincing impersonations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPhishing, which refers to scammers deceive a person into giving their personal information, is another type of the most common scams, and it's caused $19.5 million in financial losses so far.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Jeannie Patterson specialises in consumer laws and A-I at Melbourne Law School.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says artificial intelligence is becoming the power behind scams, including technologies such as deepfakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The scams are also getting better at pushing our buttons, making us anxious or emotional in some ways.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nParliament has returned to Canberra, and Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has already indicated that housing is among the issues set to dominate the fortnight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're absolutely determined to do everything we can to fast track home ownership, fast track improved number of rentals, fast track social ownership of homes as well. We want to make a difference as we target our 1.2 million homes objective with our $43 billion dollar home for Australia plan.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister says that the government will fast-track the expansion of an initiative aimed at making the property market more accessible: the First Home Buyer Guarantee.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Guarantee allows first-home buyers to buy a property with a smaller 5 per cent deposit, compared to the usual 20 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the scheme, a first home buyer looking to purchase a property at the national median price of $844,000 will only need a $42,200 deposit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government then acts as guarantor, contributing the remaining 15 per cent and allowing buyers to avoid taking out costly lender's mortgage insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing minister Clare O'Neil says it's about making the property market more equitable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This policy is going to have a hugely meaningful impact for the people who choose to use it. What we know is that it is incredibly challenging for this younger generation to get into home ownership. We are seeing young people having to save 8 or 9 years to build a deposit. With the 5 per cent deposit program that our government is expanding, we see that timeline brought back to two or three years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviously, the scheme had an annual cap on the number of people accessing it, as well as income caps on eligible participants and price caps on eligible properties.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut starting October 1st, there will be no income limit, no uptake limit, and an increased price cap on properties to better align with the national average.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn estimated 70,000 people are expected to use the expanded scheme in its first year of access, 20,000 more than the current yearly cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition has already criticised the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nNationals Senator Barnaby Joyce has told Seven's Sunrise that it will drive up property prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Housing Australia Future Fund has been, I mean huge promises, disastrous delivery, is of course just put out the price of houses people are going to be able to borrow more money so they're going to go to the auction and say 'hey guess what? We can - we can bid for more because we've got access to more money,' The price of houses just goes up. You've got to deal with the other issues and the Labor Party are not.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition housing spokesperson Andrew Bragg meanwhile is critical of the scheme being open to all first-home buyers without any income testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I think it is perverse and bizarre that children of billionaires will now have access to a government insurance scheme. Effectively, a welfare system is now going to be opened up to the children of billionaires. So it was once a targeted scheme, and now it's a universal scheme without any means testing, so that I think that is quite bizarre.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Housing Industry Association says the move is welcome and an important step in opening the doors to more people entering the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Property Council of Australia has also welcomed the scheme's expansion but says it should be regularly reviewed to ensure key markets don't overheat.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Master Builders Australia chief executive Denita Dawn says while more access is a good thing, it must be coupled with more supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We now ask the focus of the government to be on people. We simply do not have enough people to build at the moment, that's our next big issue. What are we doing around migration to make things easier for migrants to have their skills recognised in this country, it takes too long, it's too expensive. We don't have tradies as the number one skilled priority, even though they would meet the 130,000 or more threshold that needs to be changed. What are we also doing around encouraging more people into trades that should now be the next focus of the government when it comes to housing issues.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scheme's earlier start date follows the government announcing a pause on upcoming changes to the National Construction Code [[NCC]] to allow for quicker approvals to new housing projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the economic roundtable in Canberra last week, regulatory barriers described by some as burdensome were singled out as a key barrier to efficient home building.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe N-C-C will now be put on hold until 2029 - though the freeze excludes essential safety and quality changes and maintains residential standards adopted in 2022, including seven-star energy efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Bragg says the government needs more coherence in its housing policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, if you're confused about the government's housing agenda, then that makes a lot of Australians, because the government says that they want to cut red tape, but then they announced today they want to become the nation's largest mortgage insurer in addition to being a massive property developer. So either you want to cut red tape and make it easy for builders and traders and developers, or you want to have a big government solution to everything, which is what we've seen today with this expansion of the home guaranteed scheme.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Sussan Ley also hit out at the Prime Minister, saying the government has adopted policies she says were initially proposed by the coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PM hit right back.\n\n\n\n",

Phishing refers to attempts by scammers to deceive a person into giving their personal information, such as bank account details or passwords.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese losses were driven in part by a rise in cryptocurrency impersonation scams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Technology is helping scammers reach more people than ever before, and we see scams becoming more sophisticated and harder for people to detect,\" ACCC deputy chair Catriona Lowe said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Scams don't discriminate and can affect anyone, which is why open conversations with loved ones and greater awareness are so important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Government, business and individuals all have a role to play in building a scam-aware community and reaching every group, including those who may face extra barriers to understanding or reporting scams.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The scams more Australians are falling for\n\nScamwatch also received more than 6,300 reports of financial loss to shopping scams in the first half of the year. That type of scam had more reports of financial loss than any other.\n\n\n\n\n\nShopping scams can involve scammers \"creating convincing online shopping platforms, advertising fraudulent products and luring consumers with deals that appear too good to pass up\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Scammers are increasingly targeting people on websites and social media, knowing we\u2019re all spending more time and money online,\" Lowe said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Taking just a few moments to verify a seller or offer can be the difference between a good deal and a devastating financial loss.\"\n\n\n\nAI-powered scams to look out for\n\nBanks are urging Australians to remain alert to \"emerging\" scam threats, which are powered by AI.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Banking Association (ABA) chief executive Simon Birmingham said AI, a \"powerful tool\" for banks and law enforcement to combat scams, has also become the \"new weapon of choice for scammers\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Unfortunately, we live in a world where advances in AI\u2011generated video and audio make it possible for criminals to impersonate celebrities, your friends, family members or even your bank,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From fake investment ads by celebrities to voice clones asking for help, AI scams are becoming more targeted, sophisticated and emotionally manipulative.\"\n\n\n\nThe ABA is warning Australians to be on the lookout for scams using voice cloning, deepfake videos or AI-generated phishing scams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Banks will continue to fight back by using AI to detect and shut down scams so as to protect people's money, however customer vigilance is still the best form of defence,\" Birmingham said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew data from ANZ showed a 15 per cent drop in customer losses to scams between last October and June.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank said on Monday that although scams were getting more sophisticated, there was greater customer engagement with security features and more awareness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our customers are becoming increasingly aware of how to protect themselves,\" said Shaq Johnson, ANZ's head of Australia and New Zealand customer protection.\n\n\n\nANZ said it stopped $100 million worth of scams in the nine months to June and urged customers to \"continue building their awareness through available education opportunities\".\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier in August, the Commonwealth Bank said it was getting the upper hand on scammers, citing a 76 per cent fall in customer losses to fraud since a peak in early 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank said it spent almost $1 billion in 2024 to 2025 on preventing scams, including the rollout of \"two new defensive assets\" to help protect customers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the ACCC's Lowe said while it's distressing to see so many people affected by scams, it's encouraging to know that Australians \"are speaking up, seeking help and sharing what they know\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This information helps us continue to disrupt scam networks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

We acknowledge that there are issues in superannuation and tax, and that's why two and a half years ago, I proposed what is a pretty modest change, but a meaningful change which makes the system a bit more sustainable, but still maintains an element of concessionality when it comes to tax treatment and super.\u201d\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Albanese government is set to bring forward the expansion of a scheme allowing first home buyers to put down a deposit of as little as five per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile previous iterations of the initiative had a yearly cap on participants, the scheme will now be open to all home buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally slated for implementation in January 2026, the expanded scheme will begin rolling out from October.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the scheme, a first home buyer looking to purchase a property at the national median price of $844,000 would only need a $42,200 deposit.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing minister Clare O'Neil says it is clear young people need greater access to the property market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This policy is going to have a hugely meaningful impact for the people who choose to use it.

        "text": "All first home buyers in Australia will be able to get on the property ladder with a lower deposit sooner, as a federal scheme kicks in earlier than scheduled.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government's expansion of the First Homebuyer Guarantee will allow all first-home buyers to put down a deposit of 5 per cent, and will start rolling out from 1 October, three months earlier than its original start time of January 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe earlier start date for the scheme would reduce hurdles to entering the property market, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to help young people and first home buyers achieve the dream of home ownership sooner,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bringing the start date of our 5 per cent deposit scheme will do just that, getting more Australians into their home quicker, while saving money along the way.\"\n\n\n\nWhat is the first home buyer scheme?\n\nThe scheme allows first-home buyers to buy a property with a smaller 5 per cent deposit, compared to the usual 20 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government acts as guarantor and contributes the remaining 15 per cent of a deposit, allowing buyers to avoid taking out costly lenders' mortgage insurance.\n\n\n\nWhat changes are coming to the scheme?\n\nWhile the scheme isn't new, it will be expanded from 1 October to all first-home buyers \u2014 after previous versions had a yearly cap on the number of participants.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, there will no longer be income limits for participants' eligibility for the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice caps for eligible homes in the scheme in almost all jurisdictions will also be raised from October.\n\n\n\nHousing Minister Clare O'Neil said the scheme would make access to home ownership fairer. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas In Sydney, the cap will increase from $900,000 to $1.5 million, in Brisbane it will increase from $700,000 to $1 million, and in Melbourne it will increase from $800,000 to $950,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's estimated 70,000 people are expected to use the home guarantee scheme in its first year of expanded access, 20,000 more than the current yearly cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing Minister Clare O'Neil said the scheme would make access to home ownership more equitable by \"levelling the playing field\", particularly for younger people entering the property market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's just not right that an entire generation of young Australians have been locked out of the housing market, saving for decades while paying off someone else's mortgage.\"\n\n\n\nProperty prices will 'certainly rise'\n\nAMP chief economist Shane Oliver told SBS News the scheme would likely be popular, as home buyers spend on average around 11 years saving for a 20 per cent deposit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It does give a leg up to first-time buyers over existing home buyers and investors,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The scheme will be pretty popular and you're going to find a lot of buyers trying to get in through this avenue, bringing forward demand and it could lead to competition in the property market, which has the effect of pushing prices up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said property prices will certainly rise, saddling first home buyers with larger mortgages and ultimately debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can get a 5 per cent deposit in just a few years. But you will have 95 per cent of your debt to pay off, that's a very high level of debt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, for some people it may be better financially to buy a property sooner, as the market could move against you while you save a 20 per cent deposit.\n\n\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia's interest rate cuts have also resulted in spikes in property prices, meaning homes across the country could increase in value even more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you've got falling interest rates and the startup of this expanded scheme, it could supercharge the boost to property markets that otherwise would not have occurred,\" Oliver said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it's great news for existing home owners, but I don't really think it's good news for new home buyers.\"\n\n\n\nWhat other reaction has there been?\n\nThe Housing Industry Association (HIA), the country's peak national industry association for the residential construction and development industry, welcomed the expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\nHIA managing director Jocelyn Martin said: \"This promises to open doors for more people and is an important boost for aspirational home buyers in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This will make homeownership more accessible to those who may have previously been locked out of the market.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Property Council of Australia said bringing forward the scheme would help more first-home buyers bridge the deposit gap and enter the market.\n\n\n\nBut CEO Mike Zorbas said on Monday the scheme design would need to be carefully reviewed on a regular basis from mid-2026 \"to ensure key housing markets do not overheat\".\n\n\n\n\n\nEverybody's Home, a national campaign aimed at addressing Australia's housing crisis, partially through increased social housing, said the scheme was \"good for some\" but was \"not a solution to the housing affordability crisis for all\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The real solution to Australia's housing crisis is to bring down the cost of housing for everybody through measures including tax reform and more social housing,\" spokesperson Maiy Azize said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Too many Australians are locked out of home ownership because they are stuck in a rental market that makes it extremely difficult to save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To tackle the housing crisis, the federal government must make major investments in social housing; these are low-cost rentals that are guaranteed to remain affordable. Australia already faces a social housing shortfall of 640,000 homes, and that gap is only widening.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition housing spokesperson Andrew Bragg was critical of the scheme being open to all first-home buyers without any income testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is an uncapped scheme which is available to billionaires, or the children of billionaires, if they want to use a government program,\" he told ABC radio on Monday morning, warning of taxpayers \"underwriting mortgage insurance schemes for extremely wealthy people\".\n\n\n\nWhat other changes are coming to housing?\n\nThe scheme's earlier start date comes as upcoming changes to the national construction code were paused to allow for homes to be built quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code will be put on hold until 2029, with the exception of safety standards, which have been touted as reducing complexity for workers in the construction industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pause follows the federal government's productivity roundtable, which also led to the fast-tracking of environmental approvals for more than 26,000 homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

He says he's lost almost all his business. Source: SBS News It's now flagging more rules to come; planning to cut shop numbers back almost 90 per cent to 2,000 and require each one to have a doctor on site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The customers are gone,\" cannabis shop owner Suradeth Wattanasoontornkul says. \"They are scared. Everyone's business is going down.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The shop opposite us just closed. They probably couldn't bear it anymore.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, there's no real evidence Thai authorities have started enforcing the new regulations, but Suradeth says the fear they will has scared most of his customers away.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe used to sell more than $7,000 worth of cannabis every month. Last month, it dropped to less than $500.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We paid 5,000 baht ($240) to the government for a licence, but once we get that licence, they release new regulations and tell us the one we have is useless,\" Suradeth says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sure, you can hire a doctor, but the cost is very high, and not every doctor wants to work in a cannabis shop.\"\n\n\n\nThe governmental feud fuelling recriminalisation\n\nThailand's health minister says the reforms are about improving public safety and addressing rising cannabis addiction, but analysts say they are also wound up in Thailand's latest political crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June, former Cambodian leader Hun Sen leaked the audio from a controversial phone call with Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra , during which she appeared to make disparaging remarks about her own military's handling of the recent border crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer political allies in the Bhumjaithai Party, which was the main driving force behind cannabis decriminalisation, withdrew from the coalition in outrage.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin a week, Shinawatra's Pheu Thai Party had moved to recriminalise the drug .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reversal on cannabis \"has a lot to do with coalition dynamics and coalition politics,\" political analyst Thitinan Pongsudhirak from Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The cannabis policy in Thailand is synonymous with the Bhumjaithai Party. It wanted to broaden its political base by decriminalising cannabis. So, suddenly, you had these cannabis shops mushrooming around Thailand, especially in Bangkok,\" he says.\n\n\n\nThe Thai government has flagged plans to cut cannabis shop numbers back almost 90 per cent to 2,000 and require each one to have a doctor on site. Source: SBS News The industry experienced near-instant economic success; its value was already estimated above $1 billion, with the Thai Chamber of Commerce predicting that number could rise to $1.8 billion by the end of this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts believe tourists were behind much of the enthusiasm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think there was a public backlash against it,\" Pongsudhirak says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The constituencies in favour of cannabis were limited; some vendors, proprietors, tourists, the hospitality industry. But the public sentiments at large are very sceptical. The Thais, being a predominantly Buddhist country, still frowned upon vices like this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThailand's public health minister Somsak Thepsuthin says he eventually wants to relist cannabis as a category five narcotic, which would result in tougher penalties for recreational use and possession, including jail time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to tell tourists they are welcome to enjoy Thailand's culture and nature, but Thailand should not be seen as a destination for recreational cannabis use,\" Thepsuthin recently said. \"It affects children, causes nuisance from unwanted odours.\"\n\n\n\nAn industry moving underground\n\nWith the new restrictions widely unenforced and more regulations on the way, the industry has settled into a grey zone for now.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose trying to keep their businesses open say there is little clarity and a lot of confusion.\n\n\n\nKitty Chopaka says cannabis dispensary owners are reporting a rise in tourists selling the drug to other tourists, suggesting the billion-dollar business is now moving underground. Source: SBS News \"The health department is coming out with one set of information, the provinces are coming out with another set of information, when a lot of things are actually still on the drawing board,\" Kitty Chopaka from advocacy group Writing Thailand's Cannabis Future says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The shops in the provinces where the health officers happen to be strict, they are now either shut down, or are being told 'We suggest you shut down until the rules are more concrete, but if you don't shut down we will come and do a little inspection where we're then probably able to suspend your licence'.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChopaka has been speaking with a network of dispensary owners almost daily as they try to navigate the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have consistently been reporting a drop in sales since the prescription rules came into effect, but they do not believe that correlates with a drop in usage. Many believe tourists are now buying the drug from other tourists instead of the dispensaries.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the 18,000 registered shops have begun shutting down, while others are holding out to see if they might be one of the few that get to stay in business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of the small businesses are going to get removed, the small farms, the ones where the husband is the grower, the wife is the trimmer, then maybe the mother-in-law is the seller at the shop. Those guys are not going to exist anymore,\" Chopaka says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would say one small business is about ten lives you're dealing with. You've got the owner, the farms, the people who work in the shop, all of the production side of things. Each of them will have a family. And you times it by 18,000 \u2014 that's a lot of people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says: \"That's the sad part.\"\n\n\n\n",

And it is definitely the case that in Victoria, retail crime is escalating more than what we are seeing in other states.\u201d\n\nRetailers are increasingly coming forward to call out the worsening issue as punching a hole in sales and putting the safety of front-line staff at risk.\n\nDan Murphy\u2019s and BWS has implemented body-worn cameras and augmented technology to help train staff, while Rebel Sport\u2019s margins have been dented by the persistent thievery.\n\nLiquor merchants Dan Murphy\u2019s and BWS say they are grappling with organised theft.

Its grocery business grew sales by 4.3 per cent to nearly $40 billion as Coles focused on fewer, deeper promotions and locked in everyday low prices on a broad range of products during the year.\n\nWeckert said a focus on quality, value for money, availability and customer experience improved customer-experience metrics, resulting in bigger basket sizes and numbers of transactions. Investors also celebrated the result, sending Coles\u2019 share price 8.1 per cent higher.\n\nAs interest rates fall, the supermarket chief is watching to see how cost-conscious customers will respond, with behaviours like cutting back on treats, cross-shopping and using loyalty points currently still \u201cin play\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re seeing those green shoots around sentiment. The question is going to be: when do we start to see some of the behaviour change and catch up with that? The timing on that is a bit unclear on this,\u201d Weckert told reporters on Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cAs we head into the summer months and we head into Christmas, that will be something we\u2019ll keep a strong eye on because I think that will be the pull for customers to start to return to some of their behaviours around going out a bit more and catching up with friends at the park or at a restaurant.\u201d",

She\u2019s very glad he did. \u201cHe said, \u2018Let\u2019s have a chat. I\u2019m not sure what this would be like, but how about you come up to Lombadina and see my Country, and we\u2019ll go from there\u2019. So I went to Lombadina and met his elders and the leaders in this community. And we talked about who I was, what I wanted to do, Bangarra \u2013 you know, not everyone has seen or knows Bangarra, when you live in a community.\u201d Cured trout at Yarra Botanica Credit: Chris Hopkins Bangarra has a cultural and creative cycle to ensure that at every stage of a work\u2019s development, the company is working with community and has consent and permission from the people whose stories they are telling. Having secured permission from the elders in Sibosado\u2019s community, Rings returned to Lombadina in February of this year with lighting designer Damien Cooper, set designer Charles Davis and composer Brendon Boney. They woke with the sun and spent their days learning from the land. \u201cIt\u2019s being guided through that Country and given that insight. And really changing your observation from your city eyes to having bush eyes, which takes a couple of days. And not listening, not seeing and listening with the head, but it has to come from an internal feeling that\u2019s a different experience altogether.\u201d\n\nShe says the entire process in Lombadina took about a week. Was there pressure to deliver in that short time, I asked her? \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d Bangarra Dance Theatre\u2019s production Illume. Credit: Daniel Boud But she\u2019s been preparing for this kind of creative endeavour her entire life. \u201cI knew what I wanted to be when I was five years old,\u201d she says. \u201cDance is my first language. I was a dreamer, an imaginer, and would be found in the backyard creating my own world, creating these theatrical productions.\u201d The first professional production she ever saw was Cats at Sydney\u2019s Theatre Royal as a year 11 HSC dance student. \u201cIt was transformative and confirmed that that\u2019s the direction that I wanted to go,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was fascinating for me that you could take people on a journey just through the movements of the body, through this language of movement.\u201d\n\nWhen she arrived at NAISDA at the age of 17, she initially wanted to do ballet. \u201cBut I found out pretty quickly that that ship has sailed,\u201d she says. That was disappointment number one, the first of several key setbacks that made her the dancer and artist she is. She refocused her attention from ballet to modern dance and forged a connection to her Indigenous heritage through the medium. \u201cWhat I saw at NAISDA was that you could express your identity, or your challenges, or the complications of being a First Nations young person trying to find themselves and balancing lots of different issues.\u201d Frances Rings\u2019 latest work is a collaboration with a visual storyteller, the first in Bangarra\u2019s history. Credit: Chris Hopkins Rings found NAISDA transformative not just culturally and artistically, but also politically. \u201cWe turned up in 1988, the year at the Bicentenary ... Carole Johnson [NAISDA and Bangarra founder] came in with the other leaders of NAISDA at the time said, \u2018There\u2019s a big march going on, we\u2019re cancelling classes. We\u2019re all heading to Redfern. We\u2019re marching to Hyde Park\u2019.\u201d Stephen Page worked with NAISDA students on a Bangarra production while Rings was at the school, and she desperately wanted to be cast in it. She wasn\u2019t. Disappointment number two.\n\n\u201cI was devastated,\u201d she admits. \u201cAnd I thought, I\u2019m just going to use this disappointment as a motivation to just keep working and set some new goals.\u201d Baked scallop at Yarra Botanica Credit: Chris Hopkins When she graduated she auditioned for Bangarra to join the company and was put on a traineeship. \u201cStephen was very strict, and it was, \u2018you\u2019re a trainee, so you should just watch, take in what these senior artists and cultural leaders are going to teach you\u2019. \u201cAs a graduate, you\u2019re feeling on top, and then you drop to the bottom again. It was extremely humbling to be in that kind of environment where you have to listen, you have to observe, you have to wait, you\u2019ve got to be patient.\u201d Rings was patient \u2013 to a point. But she really wanted to get out on stage. Her big break came in Melbourne, where the company was performing at the Arts Centre. But it also came with disappointment number three.\n\n\u201cI was understudying some of the roles from Praying Mantis Dreaming, Stephen\u2019s first full-length work, and one of the dancers got injured. It was a matinee, and Stephen said, \u2018You\u2019re on. This is it\u2019. And he said, \u2018Do you know it?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah, I think so\u2019. We had no videos back then, so I was learning it backstage. It was a big learning experience \u2013 you\u2019ve got to be ready to go when he says go.\u201d Terrified backstage, Rings threw up a few times, and then it was showtime. \u201cI went on stage, forgot all the choreography, made up my own choreography. When I came off-stage, I was just beside myself. I thought, \u2018oh my God, Sis, you don\u2019t have a job any more\u2019.\u201d But Page was impressed that she\u2019d covered so well. \u201cHe let me have it, like, what was that? So I got a big dressing down. But [he also said], \u2018well, you got on and you kept going and you covered it. So you\u2019re lucky that you still have a job\u2019.\u201d She never did that again, always making sure she truly knew every part in the show. \u201cIt was learning by falling over and getting back up again. And I felt like I did that my whole life.\u201d\n\nNow that she\u2019s the artistic director of the company, she makes sure she pays plenty of attention to the understudies. \u201cWhen I\u2019m holding rehearsals and I see the dancers, and I always watch on the side who\u2019s understudying, who\u2019s covering, and I\u2019ve got my list in front of me. I know who\u2019s supposed to be doing which role, and if I see that they\u2019re not, I could pull them to the side and say something, but it\u2019s a lesson a dancer needs to learn on their own journey.\u201d Loading Mentorship is a hugely important part of what she does with Bangarra, and Rings says she wants her up-and-coming dancers to learn the lessons she did \u2013 though perhaps not to invent their own choreography on stage. \u201cThey\u2019d be like, \u2018well, you did it!\u2019\u201d she laughs. Her dancers all know the story, and yes, they all think it\u2019s hilarious.",

        "text": "AusPost suspends post to US in huge move\n\nAustralia Post is suspending several services to the US in response to the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs.\n\nThe government-owned agency announced the huge shift on Tuesday morning, saying many other countries\u2019 state-owned carriers have done the same.\n\n\u201cAs a result of recently announced changes to import tariffs for postal items sent to the US and Puerto Rico, Australia Post will temporarily partially suspend postal services to the United States and Puerto Rico, effective 26 August, 2025 until further notice,\u201d the notice says.\n\n\u201cThis response is in line with action taken by numerous postal operators internationally.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAustralia Post parcel and post executive Gary Starr said US Customs and Border Protection had only just alerted postal agencies to the change.\n\n\u201cAustralia Post is focused on providing a reliable and competitive postal service for customers sending parcels internationally.\n\n\u201cGuidance from CBP has only recently been issued and, like more than 190 other postal providers, we\u2019ve been working at pace to find a solution,\u201d Mr Starr said.\n\nAustralia Post has partially suspended services to the US \u201cuntil further notice\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed we have had to take this action, however, due to the complex and rapidly evolving situation, a temporary partial suspension has been necessary to allow us to develop and implement a workable solution for our customers.\n\n\u201cAustralia Post continues to work with US and Australian authorities and international postal partners to resume postal service to the US as a priority.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe national postal services of New Zealand, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France and India have made the same service suspensions.\n\nThe US government is requiring prepayment of tariffs prior to an item\u2019s arrival, and has scrapped the tariff exemption on inbound goods under $US800 ($A1230).\n\nAccording to data from US Customs and Border Patrol, 1.36 billion packages were sent to the US in 2024 under this exemption.\n\nThe White House says scrapping the $US800 tariff-free threshold would curb the supply of illicit drugs. Picture: NewsWire / Jim Watson / POOL / AFP\n\nAn Australian government spokesperson said: \u201cThe United States\u2019 decision to remove exemptions from tariffs and duties for low value imports is disappointing and will only drive up costs for American families and small businesses.\n\n\u201cThe Albanese government will work with Australia Post to limit disruption for affected customers while they make adjustments to comply with new requirements.\n\n\u201cWe continue to advocate for the removal of all tariffs on Australian exports, in line with our free trade agreement.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe parcel suspension applies to Business Contract, MyPost Business and retail customers.\n\nGifts under $US100 ($A154), letters and documents are unaffected by the change.\n\n\u201cAustralia Post is working with Zonos, an authorised US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) third-party provider, to offer a solution that will, once launched, allow services to resume for Business Contract and My Post Business customers,\u201d the notice reads.\n\n\u201cThese customers will receive communications from Australia Post on what they need to do next to be ready for when this solution goes live.\u201d\n\nThe Australia Post alert was issued on Tuesday and is effective immediately.\n\nThe change, effective immediately, affects business customers. Picture: NewsWire / Gaye Gerard\n\n\u201cPostal goods sent to the US and Puerto Rico lodged on or after 26 August 2025 will not be accepted by Australia Post until further notice.\u201d\n\nOpposition small business spokesman, Tim Wilson, said Australia Post\u2019s suspension was \u201cvery concerning\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cA lot of small businesses depend on Australia Post to ship small goods internationally,\u201d he told Sky News.\n\n\u201cSmall businesses are going to be the ones most impacted by this decision.\u201d\n\nMr Wilson put the onus on the government and diplomatic corps to try and find a solution.\n\n\u201cWe need government to engage. I suspect (US ambassador) Kevin Rudd is going to be off to the White House or Congress pretty quick smart, because we need to make sure this relationship is sorted.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last time the Albanese government said they had a relationship with another country sorted, it was Israel, and we\u2019ve seen where that\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\nOn July 31, President Donald Trump issued an executive order confirming Australian goods into the US would be subject to a 10 per cent tariff.\n\nThis 10 per cent levy is under Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d umbrella, despite Australia and the US having a free-trade agreement.\n\nThe 10 per cent duty is separate to the industry-specific, 50 per cent Trump administration tariffs on Australian steel, aluminium and copper imports - these levies remain.\n\nAnnounced on July 30, President Trump\u2019s executive order says ending the under-$US800 \u201cde minimis\u201d exemption would shield the US public from drugs.\n\n\u201c \u2026 closing the catastrophic loophole used to, among other things, evade tariffs and funnel deadly synthetic opioids as well as other unsafe or below-market products,\u201d a White House statement reads.\n\n\u201cThe de minimis exemption has been abused, with shippers sending illicit fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, precursors, and paraphernalia into the United States in reliance on the lower security measures applied to de minimis shipments, killing Americans.\u201d\n\nThe President\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act repealed the legal basis of the de minimis exemption.",

        "text": "A trial of cashless gaming machines in one state failed because \u2018punters don\u2019t governments in general\u2019. Picture: NCA Newswire / Gaye Gerard\n\nA 12-month trial of cashless gaming machines in NSW failed because of a lack of trust from patrons in \u201cgovernments in general\u201d, a budget estimates hearing has been told.\n\nOnly 14 patrons out of the 243 who signed up were deemed \u201cgenuine active users\u201d as part of the state trial, slammed by Premier Chris Minns as largely \u201cineffective\u201d.\n\nGaming Minister David Harris told estimates on Tuesday uptake of machines was low because \u201cfundamentally, the punters don\u2019t trust governments in general\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat the Premier refers to - and is correct - is that the uptake from the public was low, and it was low for a whole range of reasons,\u201d Mr Harris said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t trust the people having possession of their personal details, and that\u2019s what makes this complex.\n\nPremier Chris Minns said the 12-month cashless gaming trial was largely \u201cineffective\u201d. Picture: NCA Newswire / Gaye Gerard\n\n\u201cSo, whatever system we put in place, we have to address those issues, and that was really valuable information from the trial.\n\n\u201cBut, the Premier is right there in terms of uptake. It showed that this is a difficult question.\u201d\n\nThe state government is yet to respond to the independent Panel on Gaming Reform\u2019s road map published at the end of last year.\n\nThe report urged for an account-based gaming system to be launched in 2027 and mandatory by 2028.\n\nThe mandatory system was necessary to ensure \u201canti-money laundering and harm minimisation is achieved\u201d, the report stated.\n\nAddressing the report, Mr Harris said there were a \u201cmyriad of issues\u201d and that the government was talking to industry while developing its pathway.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that (the) government gets it correct, that we pull the right levers at the right time,\u201d Mr Harris said.\n\n\u201cWe have to look at how technology can help us deal with money laundering and criminal activities in venues.\n\n\u201cAnd, we also have to be very understanding of the economic issues, particularly in regional NSW and even patterns of regulation.\n\n\u201cSo this is incredibly complex. We don\u2019t want to get it wrong.\u201d\n\nAsked if he could give an indication of the government\u2019s direction, Mr Harris said it would be \u201ca final decision for cabinet to make\u201d.\n\nGaming Minister David Harris would not commit to the roadmap being rolled out before the next state election. Picture: Christian Gilles / NewsWire\n\nHe would not commit to the roadmap being rolled out before the next state election.\n\nMr Harris said the state government was still committed to the cashless gaming trial, but that it was not an election commitment to introduce it permanently.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at the best system that can be implemented in NSW,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Harris described it as a \u201ctrial of technology\u201d to examine what the implications would be of a \u201creal-world\u201d rollout.\n\nHe said close to 2500 machines - more than the original 500 - were implemented at more venues than initially intended as part of the trial.\n\nThe report found negative perception of the term \u201ccashless gaming\u201d, and recommended a shift to \u201caccount-based gaming\u201d.\n\nMr Harris touted a range of policies implemented by the state government amid continued pressure to implement gaming reform.\n\nHe said 43 per cent of gaming machines had been reduced to a cash limit of $500, down from $5000, since July 2023. The measure was a recommendation of the report.\n\nMr Harris said the government was also examining the potential use of facial recognition as an anti-money laundering measure.",
