(Supplied/Ashlee Sullens)\n\nBut what exactly is \ufeffUGC, how does it work, and can everyday Aussies really make money doing it?\n\nHere's everything you need to know.\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nWhat is UGC and how does it work?\n\nUGC is digital \ufeffcontent created by everyday people and/or influencers to promote products or services for brands.\n\nUGC can be used to promote everything from skincare, to restaurants, \ufeffthe latest tech products, and online services.\n\nBrands typically provide free products or services to UGC creators in exchange for them making content about it.\n\nSome brands also pay creators a fee to create content or to use \ufeffit for advertising.\n\nCommon examples of UGC include:\n\n\ufeffunboxings\n\nproduct reviews\n\nskincare routines\n\nrecipe hacks\n\nREAD MORE: Grim data reveals how a global superpower is on the brink of disaster\n\nThe UGC Sullens creates is predominantly beauty, wellness and lifestyle content. (TikTok/@ugc.ashlee)\n\nWhat sets UGC apart from traditional branded content\ufeff is that it's usually shot \"on a phone, in real homes, by real users\".\n\n\"UGC is relatable, cost-effective and often performs better than polished brand ads because it feels like a recommendation, not a sales pitch,\" said Felicity Grey, founder and managing director at Theory Crew\ufeff, a social media marketing and PR agency.\n\nIt can also help everyday Aussies make extra cash on the side.\ufeff\n\nSullens first noticed UGC on her social media feeds in 2023 and decided to give it a go.\n\nUsing her background in social media marketing, she started by filming videos about \"random products\" she had lying around the house on her iPhone.\n\n\"Before I knew it, I had brands reaching out to work together,\" she told 9news.com.au.\n\nThe \ufeffbrand deals started small but were a great boost to her part-time income.\n\nWant a pay rise? These jobs experienced the fastest salary growth this year View Gallery\n\nTwo years on, she's working for herself full-time and can earn anywhere between $2000 and $6000 per month making UGC.\n\nThere are challenges, like when one brand \"ghosted\" her without payment after she made content for it, but Sullens said the perks outweigh the pitfalls.\ufeff\n\n\"I love the flexibility and time freedom the most,\" she said.\n\nWhat role does UGC play in social media?\n\nMost of the estimated 20 million Aussies\ufeff who use social media have seen a UGC ad, though they may not have realised it.\n\nUnlike traditional brand\ufeff ads, UGC is designed to feel authentic and relatable.\ufeff\n\nThat's because it's created by everyday people rather than a marketing team.\n\n\"As audiences crave more real and relatable content and become better at spotting overly polished ads, the shift towards authenticity has become impossible to ignore,\" Grey said.\n\n\"And we know UGC ads consistently outperform branded ones.\"\ufeff\n\nREAD MORE: How to maximise public holidays and make the most of your annual leave in 2025\n\nFelicity Grey is the founder and managing director at Theory Crew, a social media marketing and PR agency. (Theory Crew)\n\nHow did UGC become popular?\n\nUGC may seem like a new trend but it has been slowly growing for over a decade.\n\nIt started with \ufeffbloggers and early influencers promoting products to online audiences in the 2010s and has only grown with the rise of platforms like TikTok.\n\nNow brands are leaning into the trend and making UGC a key part of their marketing strategy, paying everyday people to promote their products and fuelling the UGC boom.\n\nThat's largely because traditional advertising isn't as effective as it used to be.\n\nUp to 70 per cent of consumers avoid advertising and prefer to \ufeffhear from experts or everyday people rather than influencers or celebrities, as evidenced by the recent Sydney Sweeney American Eagle ad controversy.\n\nUGC \u2013 which is made almost exclusively by \"normal\" people \u2013 checks that box.\n\n\"UGC helps bring products to life in a way traditional advertising often can't,\" Grey said.\n\nTheory Crew built RISER, a mass influencer sampling platform\ufeff, specifically to meet the demand for UGC.\n\nAnd she predicts the UGC boom will only get bigger and more lucrative in the years ahead.\ufeff\n\nWhat is the difference between UGC creator and influencer?\n\nWhere \ufeffinfluencers build a personal brand to attract engaged followers, UGC creators focus on making relatable content for brands.\n\nTheir photos and videos are designed to feel more natural and they don't need a \ufefflarge following to work with big-name brands.\ufeff\n\nFrom a brand perspective, working with UGC creators typically costs less than working with influencers.\n\nBut that doesn't mean they're not making money; Sullens says she earns thousands of dollars every month from UGC.\n\nSullens can make up to $6000 a month creating UGC about things like skincare and beauty products. (Supplied/Ashlee Sullens)\n\n\"Everyday people are turning their creativity into careers, getting paid to produce content from their own homes,\" Grey said.\n\n\"You don't need a huge following, just a camera, a spark of creativity, and a willingness to show up authentically on screen.\"\ufeff\n\nHow do you become a UGC creator?\n\nGetting started as a UGC creator is fairly simple, according to both Sullens and Grey.\n\n\"Shoot content in natural light, use your own voice, and focus on being helpful or entertaining,\" Grey advised.\n\n\"You don't need a massive audience, just a clear idea of what makes a good piece of content. And don't be afraid to put yourself out there.\"\n\nYou don't need to invest in any fancy tech either.\ufeff\n\nSullens began with an iPhone and didn't pay for a tripod, microphone or editing software until she was already making money from UGC.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump calls on Intel CEO to resign for alleged ties to China\n\nSullens said Aussies don't need to invest in fancy tech to start making UGC. (Supplied/Ashlee Sullens)\n\nShe advises beginners to research what makes good UGC, focus on video quality over quantity, and get comfortable with being on-camera.\ufeff\n\nAnd remember that, like most side hustles, UGC \ufeffisn't a \"get rich quick\" scheme that guarantees overnight success.\n\n\ufeff\"As much as UGC is glamourised and seems like a super easy way to make money \u2013 which is partly true \u2013 it also takes a lot of work behind the scenes,\" she said.\n\n\"There's a lot around consumer psychology, branding, marketing and scripting that goes into each video.\"",

Moderate to extreme turbulence happens tens of thousands of times a year across the world.\n\nFor most passengers it will be felt as a few bumps, but in severe cases it can cause structural damage to the plane, temporary loss of control and injuries.\n\nREAD MORE: Top Trump officials discussed Epstein at White House meeting\n\nSouth America's bumpiest flights in 2024 traversed the Andes Mountains, home to some of the world's most turbulent skies.

In Asia, the most turbulent routes are in Nepal, China and Japan. (CNN)\n\nMountain ranges are large, immovable obstacles that alter air flow.\n\nThey can create waves of air able to travel hundreds of miles. When these waves break, they cause a lot of turbulence, like ocean waves breaking into churning white foam, said Gallego Marcos.\n\nThe majority of the 10 most turbulent routes in the world involve mountains, including the Andes, the longest land-based mountain chain on Earth, and the Himalayas.\n\nIn the United States, the bumpiest routes are dominated by flights crisscrossing the Rocky Mountains to and from Denver and Salt Lake City.\n\nIt's the same story in Europe, where many of the most turbulent routes are over the Alps, as planes zip between France, Italy and Switzerland, according to Turbli.\n\nPilots are very aware of the need to take extra care over mountains, but the turbulence they cause is not always predictable. It \"can be due to very small-scale features of the mountain\" not always picked up in forecasts, Gallego Marcos said.\n\nMountains are always there, but another form of turbulence can seemingly appear from nowhere, with no obvious visual cues to warn pilots.\n\nREAD MORE: Netanyahu says Israel plans to take over Gaza as officials discuss widening its offensive\n\nPlane service carts, food and items thrown about after turbulence during a Delta flight on July 30 (CNN)\n\nIt's called clear-air turbulence and is most often used to describe turbulence near jet streams, wavy rivers of fast-moving air high in the atmosphere where planes cruise. It's caused by \"wind shear,\" a rapid change of wind speed or direction with altitude.\n\nThis type of turbulence is \"hazardous because it's hard to detect and forecast,\" said Piers Buchanan, aviation applications science manager at the UK Met Office.\n\nThe 320-mile route between the Japanese cities of Natori and Tokoname is one of the most turbulent in Asia because of this phenomenon, Gallego Marcos said.\n\nJapan has a \"particularly strong jet stream,\" he said, as the Americans discovered during World War II when bombs they dropped on Japan were swept off target by strong winds.\n\nJet stream strength is driven by temperature difference. In Japan, frigid air from Siberia meets warm air from Pacific Ocean currents, fueling a very strong and relatively stable jet stream throughout the year.\n\nA similar phenomenon happens on the US East Coast, where warm air from the Gulf Stream meets cold air from Canada. \"The North Atlantic Corridor, especially between North America and Europe, (is) where jet streams are strongest,\" Buchanan told CNN.\n\nREAD MORE: The costly hidden issue lurking under the toilets in homes around Australia\n\nMost of the bumpiest flights were in South America and Asia, but the list also included long-haul flights across the Indian Ocean. (CNN)\n\nAs the planet warms, clear-air turbulence is intensifying, according to recent research.\n\nIt works like this: Climate change increases temperature differences in the upper atmosphere which makes wind speeds more volatile and results in more clear-air turbulence where planes fly.\n\nSevere clear-air turbulence over the North Atlantic \u2014 one of the planet's busiest flight routes \u2014 was 55 per cent more frequent in 2020 than 1979, according to a 2023 study, which also found increases of 41 per cent over the continental US.\n\nAnd it's set to get worse. Turbulence strong enough to cause injury is projected to double or even triple in frequency globally by the end of the century, according to a 2017 study\n\nThunderstorms and towering cumulus clouds are another key source of turbulence, which is particularly pronounced near the equator. \"It's driven by strong vertical air movement and can be sudden and severe,\" Buchanan said.\n\nThis type of turbulence does not feature in Turbli's rankings because pilots tend to avoid it.\n\nA flight attendant was thrown into the ceiling during mid-air turbulence on board an ALK Airlines flight in Kosovo. (Storyful)\n\nPlanes are constantly scanning for storms using onboard radar and ground-based equipment. \"Your pilot will be kind of zigzagging around thunderstorm clouds,\" Gallego Marcos said.\n\nThere are still perils, however. Forecasts are not always precise enough catch thunderstorm turbulence and storms can also generate outbursts that can't really be predicted or seen by the radar, said Gallego Marcos.\n\nA particular danger is when several storms form at the same time and pilots risk getting caught between huge thunderstorm clouds.\n\nAviation experts believe this may have happened to the London-to-Singapore flight last year, when it encountered storms over Myanmar.\n\nScientists are exploring whether climate change may also be increasing this kind of turbulence as a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, which fuels more intense thunderstorms.\n\nThe relationship between expected climate changes and turbulence \"is a very active area of investigation,\" said Robert Sharman, senior scientist emeritus at the National Centre for Atmospheric Research. It's hard to pin down firm data, he told CNN.\n\nThough there have been no commercial deaths from turbulence in over a decade, it can still create serious risks. (CNN)\n\nExperts stress flying is still the safest form of transport. Planes are specifically designed to withstand even severe turbulence and buckling your seatbelt is the surest way to avoid injury, Gallego Marcos said.\n\nOur understanding of the phenomenon is also getting better. We can now accurately forecast about 75 per cent of turbulence, said Joana Medeiros, a meteorology researcher at Reading University.",

        "text": "The Perth Institute of Contemporary Art's (PICA) annual national graduate show, Hatched, is a chance for 23 artists from around the country to get their first taste of professional life.\n\nNow in its 34th year, Hatched takes the best of graduating artists' work from 20 institutions around Australia to create the only national graduate survey exhibition.\n\n\"[Hatched] is part of our work in supporting emerging artists,\" PICA director and CEO Hannah Mathews said.\n\n\"Hatched, over its exhibition history, has presented the work of over 1,400 artists to audiences here in Perth, and some of those artists have gone on to really big careers.\"\n\nHannah Mathews says the exhibition helps emerging artists from around Australia to find each other. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nOne of those artists is Archie Moore, whose work 'kith and kin' won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 2024. Khaled Sabsabi, whose work featured in Hatched in 2005, will represent Australia in Venice in 2026.\n\nTo be selected for Hatched, graduating artists are nominated by their lecturers and then hand-selected by a panel of artists and curators from each school.\n\n\"It's quite a rigorous process. So it means that the quality, the rigour of the work, the ambition and experimentation of the work is quite high, which is really good,\" Mathews said.\n\n\" This is a professional gig. It's a creative compulsion for artists, but it's also a professional pathway that PICA wants to support them on. \"\n\nPICA Hatched temporary exhibition space in Forrest Place. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nMaking a career in art\n\nOver the years, Hatched has expanded from being an exhibition to a professional development opportunity that teaches participants what's involved in being a working artist, and how to keep going financially while they do that.\n\n\"The artists all come to Perth. They meet, they spend time together, they watch someone else install their work, they learn about fundraising, they learn about media writing, they learn about how to think about accessibility and training and access for their work,\" Mathews said.\n\nMarcus Payne's work, Yorkshire Tea, involves real tea and many smashed tea cups. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nThis year, through the philanthropic support of the Mindaroo Foundation, PICA has paid each artist a loan fee for their work, which is industry best practice.\n\nNo-one quite seems to remember how the only national survey of art school graduates in the country came to be in Perth, but Mathews says one of the great things about the event, especially for artists not based in Sydney or Melbourne, is giving them a community.\n\n\"One of the big things that the artists in Hatched reflect on each year is that they love having made this community of peers, so that when they travel to Adelaide or they travel to Sydney, or they go up to Darwin, they know someone in town,\" she said.\n\n\" They've got someone to call when things get challenging. They've got someone to call if they have a question or a problem or an achievement. \"\n\nMadi Jones's hyper-realistic self-portraits, Internalised I & II, were created with ball-point pens. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nThe fragility and comfort of home\n\nRosemary Tamas-Cao, who graduated from the Queensland College of Art and Design in Brisbane, has a work in Hatched called 'ee with ellow owers' that the notes record is made of Vietnamese rice paper, onion skins, hair, cotton thread, rice, a fridge shelf, perspex wire and LED lights.\n\nRosemary Tamas-Cao says her work highlights the fragility of home. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\n\"This work is an installation performance and it's set as an incomplete room, so the walls are made of Vietnamese rice paper and there are missing walls as well,\" Tamas-Cao said.\n\n\"The space itself recalls temporary housing that my family and I were accommodated in when I was younger.\n\n\"All the materials, including the rice paper, the onion skins and my hair, which is used to stitch poems, they are all really impermanent and scant.\n\n\"But for me, they evoke a comfort, the nourishment and presence of my home. And a key part of this work, too, was showcasing the fragility of home in a time of the upheaval of both the climate and housing scenes.\"\n\nRosemary Tamas-Cao's work, ee with ellow ours, on display at Hatched. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nRosemary Tamas-Cao's work uses rice paper which degrades over the course of the exhibition. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nTamas-Cao said being chosen for Hatched was \"super exciting\".\n\n\"I'm immensely grateful for this opportunity,\" she said, adding that her university gave her a lot of encouragement.\n\nTalking back to colonial imagery\n\nFor Tom Duffy, a Dharug man who studied creative arts at the University of Wollongong in New South Wales, art is a way of speaking back to colonial narratives and depictions of Aboriginal people.\n\nHis triptych, 'Djagats (The Newly Arrived/Native Dignity)' takes two paintings by 19th century artist Samuel Thomas Gill and challenges how Gill depicted First Nations people.\n\nTom Duffy has challenged depictions of Aboriginal people in colonial art. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nIn Gill's Native Dignity, a First Nations couple promenades down a street, wearing shredded versions of Victorian dress \u2014 the frockcoat, top hat and crinoline skirt.\n\nIn the background, a white couple, more conservatively dressed, regard the couple with disdain and horror, and the picture seems to mock the Aboriginal couple's confidence.\n\nIn Duffy's interpretation, the couple's true dignity is restored, and the paintwork references possum fur, a traditional garment that was stamped out by the colonists who insisted Aboriginal people must wear European-style clothing.\n\nOne of the three works from Tom Duffy's Djagats (The Newly Arrived/Native Dignity) triptych. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\n\"I wanted to use [Gill's] material and flip it so that it became a symbol of pride for Aboriginal people,\" Duffy said.\n\n\"I've used the craft of possum fur as a symbolic thing in the work as well. It was a craft that got put to sleep by colonialism.\n\n\"When the settlers came, there was a process where Aboriginal people had to dress like the white men.\n\n\"The possum fur clothing disappeared, and in the last maybe 50 years, it's been reawakened.\n\n\"And so now that possum fur is a symbol of cultural resilience.\"\n\nTom Duffy's work Djagats (The Newly Arrived/Native Dignity) triptych. (ABC News: Emma Wynne)\n\nThe centre image references Gill's painting, 'The Newly Arrived', where a group of newly arrived colonists have encountered a First Nations father and son, who are dancing for them, as one of the men reaches into his pocket to give them a few coins.\n\n\"[The original image] positioned the Aboriginal man who was dancing in a position of desperation,\" Duffy said.\n\n\"I was hoping that this work could bring back what dancing is for our mob, that it's a huge part of culture.\n\n\"It's a way of sharing knowledge and celebration. And it's not something that we do to please people.\"\n\nMotivation to continue\n\nDuffy said that having his work selected for the Hatched exhibition was a huge boost.\n\n\"I honestly couldn't believe it,\" he said.\n\n\"I only started doing art when I signed up for university, and so to be here so soon \u2014 and in such a big opportunity for all of us artists who are so early in their careers \u2014 is very exciting.\n\n\" It's definitely a lot of motivation to keep doing what I'm doing. Yeah, and hopefully there are still bigger things to come. \"\n\nGallery in former office\n\nThis year, with PICA's entrance blocked by construction work in the Perth cultural centre and the interior of the gallery taken up with installation of long-awaited air-conditioning, Hatched has relocated.\n\nThe exhibition space is on level three of Forrest Chase, the shopping centre that includes Myer and other retailers, and was formerly a Flight Centre office.\n\nMim Kowner used still photos from Matildas matches to create her series of three paintings.

(Supplied: Tex Beck)\n\nLisa was \"hooked\" and started paragliding every day, even during lunch breaks at her retail job.\n\n\"I was good at selling because I was so happy all the time,\" she said.\n\nLisa then learned how to hang glide, which involves pilots flying underneath a rigid, triangular frame rather than under a parachute-like wing.\n\nHang gliding is a niche but beloved sport. (Supplied: Tex Beck)\n\nBut she said that drew protests from her boyfriend, as hang gliding had a much bigger physical strain on her injured leg.\n\n\"So I'd sneak out and I was learning hang gliding on the sly,\" she said.\n\n\"I did my first solo and I was so happy, but I couldn't tell him, so I thought it [was] probably time to move on.\"\n\nOver the years, Lisa's passion for hang gliding and paragliding grew stronger.\n\nSo much so that she has built a three-decade career as a paragliding and hang-gliding instructor.\n\nShe has also competed in international competitions.\n\nFuture of sport up in the air\n\nNow based near Beaudesert in Queensland, Lisa has seen the number of young people learning to hang glide drop significantly.\n\nLisa Bradley takes a customer on a hang-gliding joy flight. (Supplied: Lisa Bradley)\n\nShe said rising insurance premiums, membership fees for clubs, and the cost of equipment had made \"a lot of instructors drop out of the sport\".\n\n\"The future for hang gliding, it's really unknown to be honest,\" she said.\n\n\"Most instructors only put through six people a year, so if you're paying thousands and thousands of dollars in insurance, you're not even going to be getting it back.\n\n\"The sport is not looking real good.\"\n\nThis hang glider designed by John Dickenson was flown in a water-skiing stunt at Grafton in 1963. (Supplied: Fuller family archive)\n\nHang gliding grew in popularity from the 1960s but enthusiasts began shifting towards paragliding in the 1990s, according to the Sports Aviation Federation of Australia [SAFA].\n\n\"A paraglider is a bit more convenient to set up. It only takes five or 10 minutes compared to half an hour or an hour for some of the more advanced hang gliders,\" SAFA president Alistair Dickie said.\n\n\" [Paraglider] technology, the wings, is better now [and] the materials they're made of are better. \"\n\nAlistair said about a quarter of SAFA's 3,000 members were hang gliders, while around 75 per cent were paragliders.\n\nHe estimates there are fewer than 10 hang-gliding schools left in Australia.\n\nParagliding has been rising in popularity since the 1990s. (Supplied: Tex Beck)\n\nBut is it risky?\n\nWhile there are some perceptions that hang gliding and paragliding are dangerous, Lisa said the sport was as \"safe as you want to make it\".\n\n\"I only fly with good equipment and I only fly in conditions I know I have the skills for,\" she said.\n\n\"If you fly in the wrong conditions or with equipment that's not good, well, you're asking for trouble.\"\n\nA 2021 study of injury-related fatalities in Australian sport by researchers at Edith Cowan University found that more people died in skydiving and parachuting accidents over a 19-year period.\n\nBetween July 2000 and December 2019, there were 20 deaths linked to unpowered hang gliding, and 19 deaths linked to unpowered paragliding \u2014 equating to one death per year in each sport.\n\nHowever, over the same period, there were 36 deaths linked to skydiving and parachuting, and 23 deaths of people participating in aerobatics.\n\nAlistair said the number of safety tests conducted on paragliding equipment had increased significantly in recent decades.\n\n\"All of this is making paragliding easier and more accessible for people,\" he said.\n\nWell worth it, despite costs\n\nBut, Alistair said, while hang gliding and paragliding were cheaper than other forms of aviation, anyone wanting to take up either sport would have to find about $10,000 to buy the gear and undergo training.\n\nHowever, the feeling of soaring across the sky was unmatched.\n\n\"We've got these magical aircraft that give us wings,\" he said.\n\n\"Stepping off the hill late in the day into air that's going up, and floating around \u2014 soaring \u2014 is just so relaxing and lovely.\"\n\nLisa described hang gliding as amazing, but it required participants to be strong.\n\n\"You need to be fit and fully committed,\" she said.\n\n\"It needs to be in the public eye more because if you don't see it, people don't even think about it.\"",

(ABC North Qld: Lily Nothling)\n\nThe state government intends to consult the public before the proposed changes come into effect, potentially by the end of the year.\n\nMr Miller said while the new stock level was good news it still showed a long-term decline in the last decade that had only seen a \"slight uptick\" in the last couple of years.\n\nHe said the state government should wait until it saw stronger evidence of stock recovery for changes to be made to catch limits.\n\n\"We still need to be very precautionary in how we're managing Spanish mackerel,\" he said.\n\nMr Bobbermen hoped the move would bring commercial operators back to the water.\n\n\"It means they won't have to surrender so many units of quota to get one kilo of fish, which is going to give them more value,\" he said.\n\n\"Some of the guys that stepped away from the industry will return.\"",

(ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\nYes In My Backyard Hobart (YIMBY Hobart) spokeswoman Susan Wallace said it was a \"golden opportunity\" to increase inner-city housing opportunities.\n\n\"We're constantly pushing the outer urban boundary and people are finding themselves pushed right to the outskirts of the city and thus having to drive cars into the city when they work,\" Ms Wallace said.\n\n\" Our concern is that it will get developed into either a big box shopping centre, car parking or another car yard for Hobart. \"\n\nThe site is on a busy street in Hobart. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\nThe group wants the state or federal governments to buy the block, or for UTAS to ensure it is sold with housing in the developer's plan.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the university said they recognised the significance of the site and the potential it held to enhance the city.\n\nThe ABC understands UTAS has not placed conditions on the sale to ensure the developer includes housing in the project.\n\nCity of Hobart councillor Ryan Posselt said building homes would help increase city density to reduce congestion and enhance the economy.\n\nCity of Hobart councillor Ryan Posselt says he will advocate for the site to become residental. (ABC News: Scout Wallen)\n\n\"[The site] represents a unique once-in-a-generation opportunity for the city to control what is built on an entire city block,\" he said.\n\n\"We cannot squander this opportunity and leave it to the private sector to build another big box store car yard or even single-storey development.\"\n\nLack of demonstrated market demand\n\nMr Purves said governments need to incentivise and de-risk the project for developers, and others like it, by reducing the planning assessment pathway, or by helping provide major infrastructure upgrades.\n\n\"Coordinating those types of add-ons to projects like that can be quite problematic, difficult and expensive,\" he said.\n\n\"What we've seen is that these types of sites tend to get a one to two-storey response, which is a pretty low level of development, and we lose that opportunity for more intense projects.\"\n\nThe site is right in the central business district of Hobart. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\nThe Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme, which provides financial assistance for costs incurred for shipping goods over Bass Strait, does not cover building and construction materials and equipment.\n\nMr Purves said while changing that would help reduce construction costs and provide subsidies for transport, there were still larger issues at play.\n\n\"The problem we have is that the development sector isn't really able to fund and kick those projects off the ground because there is a lack of demonstrated market demand,\" he said.\n\nMayor Anna Reynolds says the council would be willing to provide concessions to a developer with the right plan. (ABC News: Leon Compton)\n\nLord Mayor of Hobart Anna Reynolds said although purchasing the block of land outright was not feasible for the council, it would be willing to offer incentives.\n\n\"We can play a role in waiving rates, waiving fees \u2026 and waiving other sort of planning restrictions that add to the costs of the development,\" Cr Reynolds said.",

        "text": "Ever since she was barely a teen, the only quarrels I have ever had with my adored niece, Winnie, have been over the royalties payable on intellectual property.\n\nI'm aware that sentence makes weekends at Auntie Virginia's sound like a real barrel of laughs. To be honest, such weekends could often include impromptu lectures on the only acceptable cheese for making cheese on toast, and the importance of making sure one's undies are actually on before going out (\"doesn't matter\", was usually her airy reply) but as she got older and brought her own worldview on movies, music and TV shows into my world \u2014 that's when we'd clash.\n\nShe was a fine representation of her generation and stood up with great gusto for the things that matter to them \u2014 to whit, ripping as much content as possible online and from streaming platforms without paying for it.\n\nWhat's yours is mine\n\nI was aghast. \"But you love those musicians! If you don't actually pay for their music, and pay them a living, how do you imagine they're going to be around to keep making the music you love?\"\n\nThe answers usually involved something about Sony/Apple/Netflix/Universal \"being able to afford it.\" Why should her friends care when they were broke teenagers staring into the content-rich maw of the mega-corporations?\n\nArtist fights back against AI fakes Photo shows Four members of Grammy nominated band Hiatus Kaiyote pose against pink backdrop Australian musician Paul Bender says a lack of security is making AI-generated Spotify scams easier than ever.\n\nMaybe it was their version of sticking it to the man, the man being the billionaire nerd who now controlled their every means of communication.\n\nAnd she wasn't copping from me what she regarded as some gen X hypocrisy: \"You taped songs from the radio and copied songs onto 'mixed tapes' \u2014 what's the difference?\" (You and I know that radio stations pay royalties for playing those songs, and you had to have the hard copy of the music in your hands in the first place to make the mix \u2026 but let's leave it there.)\n\nShe and her generation had been trained by experts to take and share content, and to unhesitatingly share their data and privacy back: what's yours is mine, what's mine is yours.\n\nMy philosophical battle with Winnie is on my mind because we stand at the brink of a generational fight over the importance of IP and its value to the creator, and I have a terrible feeling that if you are 50 or older, then we are going to be fighting this on our own.\n\nWe stand at the brink of a generational fight over the importance of IP and its value to the creator. (Unsplash: Glenn Carstens-Peter)\n\nAI could be trained on copyrighted Australian work\n\nIn an interim report released this week, the Productivity Commission has put forward a bold proposal: a text and data mining exception to the Australian Copyright Act. Put simply, this would legalise using Australian copyrighted material to train AI large language models \u2014 ChatGPT and the like. The proposal aims to slot AI training into the existing \"fair dealing\" exceptions already built into copyright law.\n\nWhy is this on the table now? Because the commission sees a potential windfall for the Australian economy \u2014 an estimated $116 billion over the next decade \u2014 fuelled by developments in AI and digital tech. Harnessing data this way isn't just about innovation, the commission says, it's about a very real shot at economic growth.\n\nJim Chalmers is pitching himself as a Goldilocks on AI Photo shows Jim Chalmers Treasurer Jim Chalmers is optimistic the benefits of AI will ultimately outweigh the risks.\n\nAh, growth! The sole defining feature of a successful modern economy. Even at a time with the failures of late-stage capitalism collapsing around us like the special effects of a Marvel movie, we cling to this as the only ideal, the only aim. And, in service to this ideal, the commission would like us to be comfortable with trading away the few financial benefits that come from original creativity.\n\nOnce again, I'm aghast. Artists have already had to make the worst deal of their lives with streaming services, trading away what would have been worth a fortune, even during the \"bad\" old days of big, bad record labels. Please watch this interview with songwriter Julianna Zachariou, who adds up live on air what she makes from a Spotify stream, and you'll never feel the same about your music streaming services: she's talking about numbers that, as sold records as part of a decent contract, would have made her an actual millionaire in the 1970s.\n\nThis new proposal means taking away, for free, the one and only thing that creatives make and from which they can make money. We should all be astonished at the suggestion.\n\nLoading...\n\nFree food for Big Tech\n\nI know I'm not surprising you with this point of view: you would expect someone like me, who spends their time celebrating original creativity, to be appalled at the notion that the copyrighted work of creatives can be used as literal free food into the aforementioned maws of Big Tech to enable them to get even richer.\n\nStatement against AI training passes 50,000 signatures Photo shows Composite image of Charles Dance, Thom Yorke, and Julianne Moore on various red carpets More than 50,000 people have called for an end to the unlicensed use of creative work to train generative AI models.\n\nAs someone who struggles mightily with the existing \"fair dealing\" provisions in producing the ABCTV show Creative Types \u2014 we have to tie ourselves in knots justifying the use of 45 seconds of a film even when it's part of a relevant, thoughtful, highly analytical discussion about the detail of said copyrighted work, and mostly we can't get there because of the law's restrictions. It infuriates me that content-making like mine will remain hard, while self-enriching will get easier for the behemoths.\n\nThe move seems so foolish that opposing it seems self-evident. That's when you know it'll probably get through. On countless subjects, including even the safety of children, Big Tech has escaped unsanctioned and unregulated. Of course, they've managed to persuade institutions like the Productivity Commission that getting more for nothing is in everyone's interests.\n\nLoading...\n\nAn educated world?\n\nSince those childhood days, younger Australians like my Winnie have stepped back from total absorption by the online world: she is protective of her privacy. And she is also as angry as me at how little this digital world has benefited the hard work of the musicians she loves.\n\nSign up for Weekend Reads in your inbox Photo shows Virginia Trioli in a stylish suit on a set with lighting behind her Start your weekend with the best of the ABC's journalism, presented by Virginia Trioli.

Decades after Isaac Asimov predicted his happy world where \"machines will do the work that makes life possible and that human beings will do all the other things that make life pleasant and worthwhile\", we have finally made the trades that allow it. But it looks like we may have forgotten his most important qualifier. Asimov had a condition for this reality: \"A properly automated and educated world.\"\n\nIn our rush to hand off the work that we imagine to be a waste of our time, we've failed to educate ourselves on the real consequences.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Mark Schwarzer can still recall the look of terror in Eddie Thomson\u2019s eyes. It was 1993, and Australia was playing a World Cup qualifier against Canada in Edmonton. Fifteen minutes into the match, goalkeeper Robert Zabica made a rash challenge on striker Dale Mitchell, who had broken through the Socceroos\u2019 defensive line and was bearing down on goal. Mark Schwarzer made two penalty shootout savess for the Socceroos in 1993 but it wasn\u2019t until more than a decade later that he became a household name. Credit: SMH Zabica clattered into him just outside his box. Schwarzer, aged 20 and just a couple of months removed from winning the National Soccer League grand final with Marconi, was expecting him to be shown a yellow card. But after a period of deliberation, the referee produced a straight red \u2013 prompting a shocked Thomson, the then-Socceroos coach, to turn to his bench and look at the player he\u2019d have to send on. \u201cI remember Eddie Thomson just turning to me with his eyes wide open,\u201d Schwarzer says. \u201cProbably thinking: \u2018Oh my god. Now I\u2019ve got to play him\u2019.\u201d In a more just world, Schwarzer wouldn\u2019t have even been there. He\u2019d been called up only because Mark Bosnich, then Australia\u2019s best goalkeeper, chose club over country, a common dilemma before FIFA introduced designated international windows in 2002. The Canada games clashed with the start of the Premier League season, and Bosnich, trying to cement his spot at Aston Villa, withdrew. Schwarzer got the last-minute call-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his Aston Villa days, Mark Bosnich was considered one of the best goalkeepers in the English Premier League. Credit: Reuters \u201cIt was such an unfair scenario for \u2018Bozza\u2019 and other players to be in,\u201d Schwarzer says. \u201cIt was completely out of order for them to be put in that position. The good thing is it\u2019s been changed. But obviously, whenever those sort of scenarios develop, there\u2019s more often than not someone else who benefits from it.\u201d That was him. These were the inauspicious circumstances that launched his almost 20-year international career: one that spanned four World Cup cycles, a record 109 caps and some of the most important moments in Australian football history. It has now been recognised with a place in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, making him just the ninth footballer to be inducted. It wasn\u2019t the steadiest start. After coming on, Schwarzer conceded at his near post as Canada prevailed 2-1 over the 10-man Socceroos but in the second leg in Sydney, Australia won by the same scoreline, forcing the tie into extra time and then penalties: Schwarzer emerged as the hero by making two saves in the shootout. Bosnich was back in the team by the time the Socceroos faced Diego Maradona\u2019s Argentina in another losing World Cup qualifying play-off. It wasn\u2019t until another two saves in a shootout more than a decade later, against Uruguay, that Schwarzer would become a household name, and that the Socceroos would actually break their long World Cup drought. \u2018There were football fans that were born that night\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe story of \u201cthat night\u201d, as it has come to be known \u2013 Mark Bresciano\u2019s goal, Tony Popovic\u2019s substitution after just 31 minutes for Harry Kewell, the tension of extra time, Schwarzer\u2019s famous stops to deny Dar\u00edo Rodr\u00edguez and Marcelo Zalayeta\u2019s penalties, Mark Viduka\u2019s miss, the eternal image of a shirtless John Aloisi wheeling away after scoring his, and how it all turbocharged the growth of the sport in Australia \u2013 has been told and retold so many times that, in truth, there is nothing new to say about it. But the impact still echoes today. This year marks the 20th anniversary of that landmark achievement \u2013 one that, without a hint of hyperbole, Schwarzer believes changed not only the face of Australian sport, but the trajectory of thousands upon thousands of lives, far beyond the players and coaches who were directly involved. As he processed the heartbreak of their failure against Uruguay four years earlier, Schwarzer remembers sitting on the team bus in Montevideo, telling himself: \u201cWe just need to qualify. If we qualify, the game is going to change.\u201d As a young fan, Schwarzer remembers watching the Socceroos continually fall short of qualification, contemplating the possibility that it would never actually happen. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to get there. We\u2019re just so far away from it,\u201d he thought. \u201cYou just felt that there was something seriously missing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd then obviously as a player, at that stage in my career, I was thinking: \u2018Gosh. Am I going to miss out on this opportunity? Is it going to be after I finish playing that we\u2019re going to qualify? Am I going to be one of these players that just misses out, like so many \u2013 like Ned Zelic, Paul Okon, just to name a couple\u2019. They were instrumental in us coming through as players. They were kind of like the pioneers of the game \u2026 they missed out. I still sometimes think about it.\u201d Mark Schwarzer played for the Socceroos on 109 occasions, more than any other player in history. Credit: Getty Images Strikers always get the glory, so Aloisi\u2019s celebration became the enduring symbol but Schwarzer\u2019s performance was a seminal moment of its own. It became the benchmark by which all future Australian penalty shootouts would be measured, and it inspired many young footballers to pick up the gloves. \u201cIt\u2019s a ripple effect on not just football players, but the football community,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were football fans that were born that night, that were sucked into supporting the national team. As players who were playing week in, week out at the highest levels, in front of massive crowds and massive stadiums. It was hard to take, going back to Australia not having that all the time. \u201cFor people not to fully understand, or to really get that feeling of what it\u2019s like to go to a World Cup \u2026 we\u2019ve seen it, we\u2019ve watched it but we\u2019ve never been part of it. We all talked about it. We knew that things would change. Part of it was always about, if you can create change as big as this, to qualify again for only our second World Cup, after 32 years, this rollercoaster of emotions and experiences that we\u2019d all been part of \u2026 but none of us thought it would change to the effect that it did.\u201d \u2018The boys won the title, not me\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSetting aside his contribution at international level, Schwarzer\u2019s club career alone is possibly grounds for Hall of Fame induction. After enduring some tough early years in Germany, the country of his parents\u2019 heritage, he made his name in England. Indeed, no Aussie has played more often in the Premier League than Schwarzer, who made 514 appearances across 21 seasons for Middlesbrough, Fulham, Chelsea and Leicester City. The next best, Lucas Neill, made 279 appearances, so it\u2019s almost impossible to imagine anyone bettering Schwarzer\u2019s record, a testament to his longevity, which was incredible even for goalkeepers, who tend to have longer careers than outfields and who can play on into their 40s, as he did. \u201cThe beauty of the position is if you\u2019re able to maintain your levels of fitness and be a little bit lucky in terms of injuries, you\u2019re able to play a lot longer than most outfield players,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was obviously something that I was able to do.\u201d Through all of that time, Schwarzer won just one trophy. Well, there are two others, for which he gives himself zero credit but those aside, it\u2019s just the 2003-04 League Cup he helped Middlesbrough win as their starting goalkeeper, coming in his seventh season of regular football. His only regret? That was in 2010, when Arsene Wenger wanted to bring him to Arsenal. Schwarzer was 37 and eager to play for a club that was not only contending for the Premier League title, but also playing in the UEFA Champions League \u2013 a new experience for him. Harry Kewell and Mark Schwarzer in 2005. Credit: Getty Images At first, Fulham were open to selling him; manager Roy Hodgson told Schwarzer as such. But then Hodgson moved to Liverpool, and his replacement Mark Hughes was interested in letting him only go if the Cottagers could bring in another goalkeeper first. That didn\u2019t happen, and the door was slammed shut. \u201cThat was the one and only time in my career that I really struggled with a decision,\u201d Schwarzer says. \u201cI was desperate, and I was doing everything I possibly could to facilitate the move, but the club were working completely against me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Players obviously want to be part of that, and the desire from numbers 1-23 to run through brick walls in Sydney in the third Lions Test is all you could ask for before two Tests against the Springboks in South Africa.\n\nThe world champions are heavy favourites, and their fans will be expecting nothing less than two comprehensive wins, but even the most pessimistic, here\u2019s-another-false-dawn Wallabies supporter should acknowledge that there was something stirring in that Sydney victory.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers says the government has more work to do on regulatory reform\n\nYoung Australians urge government to set bold 2035 climate target\n\nRookie Tane Edmed not surprised he's been picked for the Wallabies\n\nFederal Treasurer Jim Chalmers admits the government has more work to do on regulatory reform, as the Productivity Commission releases its interim report on potential reforms to National Competition Policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's found aligning Australian standards with international and overseas standards could provide an economic boosts of between 1.9 and 3.8 billion dollars per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it's found greater labour mobility for high-risk licensed occupations could be worth up to 846 million dollars per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Chalmers says reform in these areas would ease burdens on business.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government will hold a conference on reforms later this month.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate change activists say the federal government has to take into account the concerns of young people when setting its 2035 emissions reduction target.\n\n\n\n\n\nA national poll by YouGov, commissioned by activist groups the Climate Council and the Climate Action Network, has found 61 per cent of people want the government to do more on climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Council Chief Executive Amanda McKenzie says support for action is particularly strong amongst younger people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that Australia's largest voting bloc- millennial and Gen Z - are concerned about climate chance. And, again, this shows up in this polling, where almost three-quarters of Gen Z voters expect the government to set a strong 2035 target.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMillenials are generally defined as those born between 1981 and 1996, whilst Gen Z are those born between 1997 and 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is required to set a 2035 emissions reduction target by the UN in the coming months, with activists urging that target to be 60 per cent or more.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nA new report has found up to a third of schools in Queensland are in poor condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Education's Comprehensive Review of Infrastructure Renewal report says there is a maintenance backlog which would cost an $441 million to address.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has identified a number of concerns with unsafe infrastructure that includes rotting ceilings in some school buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation Minister John-Paul Langbroek has blamed the report's findings on the previous Labor government, saying it is evidence the party did not spend enough on schools during their term in office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a report that Labor commissioned because they knew there were issues. These were issues we had last time we were in government when we had a significant maintenance backlog. And it's clear they knew about the issue. And the report shows they under-invested in maintenance, and that's to the detriment of our teachers and students.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations is warning any further escalation in Gaza would be catastrophic, as Israel\u2019s Security Cabinet considers expanding military operations in areas not yet under its control.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 61,250 Palestinians have been killed since the war began nearly two years ago, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the population is now displaced and facing extreme hunger.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 42 more Palestinians were reportedly killed on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tells Fox News Israel intends to completely occupy Gaza to remove Hamas and install a new civilian government, a move still pending cabinet approval.\n\n\n\n\n\nUN spokesperson Farhan Haq says such an escalation would severely worsen the crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have already made clear the fact that the occupation of the occupied territories cannot and must not continue. It is not accepted under international law. Regarding the comments, we'll have to see what actions the government takes, and we will respond accordingly. But we have already make clear our concerns that any expansion of the conflict will be catastrophic.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN also warned that delivering aid will become nearly impossible if the fighting expands further.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nCambodia and Thailand have formally agreed to a ceasefire following border clashes that began on the 24th of July.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deal was signed at an extraordinary General Border Committee (GBC) meeting in Kuala Lumpur, attended by officials from both nations and observers from China, Malaysia, and the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agreement commits both sides to halt all forms of fire, maintain current troop positions, and avoid military build-ups.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptured soldiers will be treated according to international humanitarian law.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ASEAN observer team, led by Malaysia, will monitor the ceasefire, with temporary oversight by defence attaches from ASEAN states.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two sides also pledged to keep communication lines open, hold a Regional Border Committee meeting within two weeks, and convene the next G-B-C session within a month.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nIn rugby union, Tane Edmed says he's not surprised to have been picked in the Australian squad for the start of The Rugby Championship, despite recently being out of the team.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith first-choice fly-half Tom Lynagh out with a concussion, Edmed has been picked in the 35-man squad to travel to Johannesburg to play South Africa in their tournament-opening game on Sunday week.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdmed has never played a Test for the Wallabies, but says his contact with coach Joe Schmidt made him feel he was a chance to be chosen, despite a poor ending to his Super Rugby season for the ACT Brumbies, and his not being picked in the Australian squad that recently played the British and Irish Lions.\n\n\n\n",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Mark Schwarzer can still recall the look of terror in Eddie Thomson\u2019s eyes. It was 1993, and Australia was playing a World Cup qualifier against Canada in Edmonton. Fifteen minutes into the match, goalkeeper Robert Zabica made a rash challenge on striker Dale Mitchell, who had broken through the Socceroos\u2019 defensive line and was bearing down on goal. Mark Schwarzer made two penalty shootout savess for the Socceroos in 1993 but it wasn\u2019t until more than a decade later that he became a household name. Credit: SMH Zabica clattered into him just outside his box. Schwarzer, aged 20 and just a couple of months removed from winning the National Soccer League grand final with Marconi, was expecting him to be shown a yellow card. But after a period of deliberation, the referee produced a straight red \u2013 prompting a shocked Thomson, the then-Socceroos coach, to turn to his bench and look at the player he\u2019d have to send on. \u201cI remember Eddie Thomson just turning to me with his eyes wide open,\u201d Schwarzer says. \u201cProbably thinking: \u2018Oh my god. Now I\u2019ve got to play him\u2019.\u201d In a more just world, Schwarzer wouldn\u2019t have even been there. He\u2019d been called up only because Mark Bosnich, then Australia\u2019s best goalkeeper, chose club over country, a common dilemma before FIFA introduced designated international windows in 2002. The Canada games clashed with the start of the Premier League season, and Bosnich, trying to cement his spot at Aston Villa, withdrew. Schwarzer got the last-minute call-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his Aston Villa days, Mark Bosnich was considered one of the best goalkeepers in the English Premier League. Credit: Reuters \u201cIt was such an unfair scenario for \u2018Bozza\u2019 and other players to be in,\u201d Schwarzer says. \u201cIt was completely out of order for them to be put in that position. The good thing is it\u2019s been changed. But obviously, whenever those sort of scenarios develop, there\u2019s more often than not someone else who benefits from it.\u201d That was him. These were the inauspicious circumstances that launched his almost 20-year international career: one that spanned four World Cup cycles, a record 109 caps and some of the most important moments in Australian football history. It has now been recognised with a place in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, making him just the ninth footballer to be inducted. It wasn\u2019t the steadiest start. After coming on, Schwarzer conceded at his near post as Canada prevailed 2-1 over the 10-man Socceroos but in the second leg in Sydney, Australia won by the same scoreline, forcing the tie into extra time and then penalties: Schwarzer emerged as the hero by making two saves in the shootout. Bosnich was back in the team by the time the Socceroos faced Diego Maradona\u2019s Argentina in another losing World Cup qualifying play-off. It wasn\u2019t until another two saves in a shootout more than a decade later, against Uruguay, that Schwarzer would become a household name, and that the Socceroos would actually break their long World Cup drought. \u2018There were football fans that were born that night\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe story of \u201cthat night\u201d, as it has come to be known \u2013 Mark Bresciano\u2019s goal, Tony Popovic\u2019s substitution after just 31 minutes for Harry Kewell, the tension of extra time, Schwarzer\u2019s famous stops to deny Dar\u00edo Rodr\u00edguez and Marcelo Zalayeta\u2019s penalties, Mark Viduka\u2019s miss, the eternal image of a shirtless John Aloisi wheeling away after scoring his, and how it all turbocharged the growth of the sport in Australia \u2013 has been told and retold so many times that, in truth, there is nothing new to say about it. But the impact still echoes today. This year marks the 20th anniversary of that landmark achievement \u2013 one that, without a hint of hyperbole, Schwarzer believes changed not only the face of Australian sport, but the trajectory of thousands upon thousands of lives, far beyond the players and coaches who were directly involved. As he processed the heartbreak of their failure against Uruguay four years earlier, Schwarzer remembers sitting on the team bus in Montevideo, telling himself: \u201cWe just need to qualify. If we qualify, the game is going to change.\u201d As a young fan, Schwarzer remembers watching the Socceroos continually fall short of qualification, contemplating the possibility that it would never actually happen. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to get there. We\u2019re just so far away from it,\u201d he thought. \u201cYou just felt that there was something seriously missing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd then obviously as a player, at that stage in my career, I was thinking: \u2018Gosh. Am I going to miss out on this opportunity? Is it going to be after I finish playing that we\u2019re going to qualify? Am I going to be one of these players that just misses out, like so many \u2013 like Ned Zelic, Paul Okon, just to name a couple\u2019. They were instrumental in us coming through as players. They were kind of like the pioneers of the game \u2026 they missed out. I still sometimes think about it.\u201d Mark Schwarzer played for the Socceroos on 109 occasions, more than any other player in history. Credit: Getty Images Strikers always get the glory, so Aloisi\u2019s celebration became the enduring symbol but Schwarzer\u2019s performance was a seminal moment of its own. It became the benchmark by which all future Australian penalty shootouts would be measured, and it inspired many young footballers to pick up the gloves. \u201cIt\u2019s a ripple effect on not just football players, but the football community,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were football fans that were born that night, that were sucked into supporting the national team. As players who were playing week in, week out at the highest levels, in front of massive crowds and massive stadiums. It was hard to take, going back to Australia not having that all the time. \u201cFor people not to fully understand, or to really get that feeling of what it\u2019s like to go to a World Cup \u2026 we\u2019ve seen it, we\u2019ve watched it but we\u2019ve never been part of it. We all talked about it. We knew that things would change. Part of it was always about, if you can create change as big as this, to qualify again for only our second World Cup, after 32 years, this rollercoaster of emotions and experiences that we\u2019d all been part of \u2026 but none of us thought it would change to the effect that it did.\u201d \u2018The boys won the title, not me\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSetting aside his contribution at international level, Schwarzer\u2019s club career alone is possibly grounds for Hall of Fame induction. After enduring some tough early years in Germany, the country of his parents\u2019 heritage, he made his name in England. Indeed, no Aussie has played more often in the Premier League than Schwarzer, who made 514 appearances across 21 seasons for Middlesbrough, Fulham, Chelsea and Leicester City. The next best, Lucas Neill, made 279 appearances, so it\u2019s almost impossible to imagine anyone bettering Schwarzer\u2019s record, a testament to his longevity, which was incredible even for goalkeepers, who tend to have longer careers than outfields and who can play on into their 40s, as he did. \u201cThe beauty of the position is if you\u2019re able to maintain your levels of fitness and be a little bit lucky in terms of injuries, you\u2019re able to play a lot longer than most outfield players,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was obviously something that I was able to do.\u201d Through all of that time, Schwarzer won just one trophy. Well, there are two others, for which he gives himself zero credit but those aside, it\u2019s just the 2003-04 League Cup he helped Middlesbrough win as their starting goalkeeper, coming in his seventh season of regular football. His only regret? That was in 2010, when Arsene Wenger wanted to bring him to Arsenal. Schwarzer was 37 and eager to play for a club that was not only contending for the Premier League title, but also playing in the UEFA Champions League \u2013 a new experience for him. Harry Kewell and Mark Schwarzer in 2005. Credit: Getty Images At first, Fulham were open to selling him; manager Roy Hodgson told Schwarzer as such. But then Hodgson moved to Liverpool, and his replacement Mark Hughes was interested in letting him only go if the Cottagers could bring in another goalkeeper first. That didn\u2019t happen, and the door was slammed shut. \u201cThat was the one and only time in my career that I really struggled with a decision,\u201d Schwarzer says. \u201cI was desperate, and I was doing everything I possibly could to facilitate the move, but the club were working completely against me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Source: Facebook/Eseta Leasi\n\nTwo siblings are among the latest deaths in the Pacific nation of Samoa, amid a devastating outbreak of dengue fever. A total of five children have succumbed to the mosquito-borne virus in recent months, with the last three deaths occurring in the space of just four days.\n\nA nine-year-old boy and his two-year-old brother from Mulifanua in Upolu became the fourth and fifth victims of the virus, passing away within days of each other.\n\nAccording to the boys\u2019 grandmother, the older brother was given Panadol in the days before his death on July 30 after showing symptoms of dengue fever.\n\nAfter waiting hours to be seen at their closest medical centre, an ambulance was eventually called to transport him to the main hospital, but his \"heartbeat dropped\" just 10 minutes into the journey.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThey returned back to the clinic, but the child could not be saved.\n\nTragically, his younger brother passed away several days later.\n\nWorkers spray for mosquitoes to help fight the growing number of dengue cases in Samoa. Source: Ministry of Health Samoa\n\nThe three other deaths include a five-year-old girl who died on July 29, an eight-year-old girl who died on July 13 and a 12-year-old boy who died in April after being flown to New Zealand for medical treatment.\n\nPrime Minister Fiam\u0113 Naomi Mata\u02bbafa this week urged parents \"not to wait until it is too late\" to seek medical attention for children affected by dengue fever.\n\n\u201cIt is important to heed advice from the Ministry of Health. For parents and guardians, please seek immediate medical assistance if your child develops dengue fever symptoms,\u201d she said at a press conference on Monday.\n\n\u201cDo not wait until it is too late. Early treatment can save lives.\u201d\n\nSamoa\u2019s Ministry of Health released their latest dengue report on Thursday, confirming four dengue-related deaths and one probable death awaiting confirmation. A further 1446 clinically diagnosed cases were reported from July 28 to August 3.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe spike in dengue cases has caused all schools across Samoa to be closed for another week, heavily disrupting the start of term 3.\n\nSamoa, along with Fiji, Tonga, the Cook Islands and Kiribati are all in the grips of dengue fever outbreaks. Other nations have also reported cases, though haven\u2019t officially announced an outbreak. These include Hawai\u2019i, French Polynesia, American Samoa, Nauru and Tuvalu.\n\nThe mosquito-borne virus has similar symptoms to a bad flu or Covid virus, which can make it difficult to diagnose without a blood test. Symptoms typically include sudden fever, headache, muscle pain, vomiting and a faint red rash.\n\nA large-scale fumigation campaign has been launched in Upolu, targeting schools, businesses and hotspot villages. Source: Government of Samoa\n\nWhy are so many children falling sick?\n\nIn Samoa, a staggering 71 per cent of dengue cases are in children younger than 15 years old.\n\nDr Mark Jacobs, WHO Representative to the South Pacific and Director of Pacific Technical Support, recently told Yahoo News there's a reason why young people are more highly represented in the statistics.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Because being infected with a strain of dengue usually provides lifelong immunity against that strain, children can be at much higher risk of being infected when the strain is reintroduced into the country,\" he said.\n\n\"Many adults would have been infected previously, meaning they are protected from reinfection with that strain.\"\n\nThere are four strains of dengue, with two currently in the Pacific. Once someone recovers from the disease, they generally get life-long immunity \u2014 but only to that strain.\n\nThe WHO advises that even a bottle cap can contain enough water for a mosquito to breed, and urges locals to do their part to clean up any potential mosquito breeding sites. Drains, gutters, bottles, buckets, wheelbarrows and even spare tyres could all collect water and turn into a breeding ground.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
