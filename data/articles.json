        "text": "In her 28 years working for the federal government, Shea Giagnorio provided daycare for the children of US soldiers, training for employees and oversight for safety net programs.\n\nPublic service took her from Germany to Alaska to Kansas City, Missouri, where she moved last year for a long-sought promotion.\n\nBut when she reported to a downtown federal building for work one day last month, her access card did not work. After a co-worker let her into the building, she checked her email: her entire office had been let go in the latest mass firing ordered by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration .\n\nShea Giagnorio packs belongings in her apartment days after getting fired from her job with the Administration for Children and Families. (AP)\n\nThe 46-year-old single mum has cancelled her apartment lease, is selling her new furniture and may have to pull her daughter out of college. She wonders what will happen to the at-risk populations her team helped serve at the Administration for Children and Families, a part of the US Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cNot only me, but all these peoples\u2019 lives are turned upside down,\u201d Giagnorio said.\n\nThe impact of the cuts by Trump appointees and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency can be found everywhere in the Kansas City metropolitan area, which has long been a major hub for federal agencies about 1600km away from Washington, DC.\n\nMoney once promised to the region for public health, environmental, diversity, food aid and an array of other programs has been axed, and thousands of local jobs are in jeopardy.\n\nWith nearly 30,000 workers, the federal government is the largest employer in the region. One longtime Kansas City economic researcher said the region could lose 6000 good-paying federal jobs, which in turn would wipe out thousands of others in service industries.\n\nAn IRS worker said thousands of her co-workers fear they will lose their jobs, even as they put in overtime processing tax refunds in a building so crowded that they struggle to find desks. Under pressure, hundreds more agreed this past week to retire early or take a buyout.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a kick in the stomach to people that are doing everything they can to meet what\u2019s required of them,\u201d said Shannon Ellis, a longtime IRS customer service representative and president of the union representing local workers.\n\nBy Thursday, at least 238 Kansas City workers had taken the buyout offers and were expected to leave the agency in coming weeks. Ellis noted many of those same workers had been told they were essential and required to work overtime during tax season, some seven days per week.\n\nGiagnorio is now on the job hunt after serving almost three decades for the US federal government. (AP)\n\nA US Department of Agriculture grant revocation disrupted a historically black neighbourhood\u2019s plan to expand its program growing fresh produce in a food desert. A nearby pantry reduced its monthly grocery allotment for those in need after federal cuts left food banks shorthanded.\n\nUrban farmer Rosie Warren grew about a ton of fruits and vegetables last year in community gardens to help feed the Ivanhoe neighbourhood, where many black families were concentrated under housing segregation policies of much of the 20th century.\n\nWarren harvested greens, potatoes and watermelons as part of an effort to address food insecurity and health concerns in a neighborhood challenged by blight, crime and poverty. She was ecstatic last fall when the USDA awarded the neighbourhood council a three-year, $US130,000 ($20grant to expand the gardens and farmers\u2019 market serving the area.\n\nIn February, the council received a notice terminating the grant. The USDA had determined the award \u201cno longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you do if you don\u2019t support providing access to food to people who don\u2019t have it? Wouldn\u2019t this make your job easier?\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s absurd. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nThe withdrawal of federal funding for new lab equipment and vaccines means the city may be less prepared for the next pandemic.\n\nElon Musk has pushed the Trump administration to swing the axe on the public service. (AP)\n\nThe Kansas City Health Department\u2019s laboratory is badly in need of an upgrade, with equipment dating to when the building opened in the 1990s.\n\nOne basement space is water damaged and rarely used. Another has equipment that is so inadequate that the city has to ship samples to a state laboratory 150 miles away, causing inefficiencies, agonizing waits for results and delayed response times.\n\nBut the funding for lab upgrades was abruptly eliminated last month as part of the Trump administration\u2019s $US11.4 billion cancellation of federal grants to states for public health.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson said the agency's downsizing, including cutting jobs and consolidating divisions, would save money and make the organisation more efficient. As for the $US11.4 billion in grant funding cuts, the spokesperson said, \u201cHHS will no longer waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a nonexistent pandemic that Americans moved on from years ago.\u201d\n\nThe IRS has offered a similar rationale for its downsizing, saying it is making process improvements that will ultimately more efficiently serve the public.\n\nMusk said last year that Trump\u2019s budget cuts would cause a \u201ctemporary hardship\u201d that would soon put the economy on stronger footing.\n\nOne local economic researcher said it remained unclear just how deep that hardship would be in Kansas City, including whether it would just slow growth or cause population losses.\n\n\u201cIt's a big burden that\u2019s being placed on a narrow group of people,\u201d said Frank Lenk, director of the Office of Economic Development at the Mid-America Regional Council, a non-profit of city and county governments in the Kansas City region. \u201cIt will definitely take some of the steam out of the local economy.\"\n\nTrump has credited DOGE with helping end \u201cthe flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars,\u201d saving billions to help improve the nation\u2019s finances.",

It depends on the day.\"\n\nA long wait for a slice of the pie\n\nThe popular holiday town, home to about 4,000 people, feted the arrival of cruise ships in 2019, with its passengers providing a much-welcome economic injection.\n\nWhile the local council hailed it as the start of an exciting new tourism industry, the boost was short-lived.\n\nThe SA government said the 2023\u201324 cruise season was the state's most successful ever.\n\nIt injected a record $227 million into the economy, according to a report commissioned by Cruise Lines International Association and the Australian Cruise Association.\n\nCopper Coast Council chief executive officer Dylan Strong said the Copper Coast was \"keen to get their slice of that\".\n\nDylan Strong says cruise ships could put Wallaroo on the map. (ABC Riverland: Matt Stephens)\n\nIn a report seen by the ABC, compiled by Regional Development Australia, Seabourn Quest's stopover in Wallaroo in 2027 is forecast to inject $96,638 into the Yorke and Mid North economy.\n\n\"We've got the economic impact, but from a high-level perspective it does put and keep Wallaroo, the Copper Coast and indeed the Yorke Peninsula on the map,\" Mr Strong said.\n\nNot all smooth sailing\n\nState Tourism Minister Zoe Bettison said it was a \"day to celebrate\" but there were still challenges on the horizon.\n\nAustralian travel brand P&O Cruises will cease sailing in March, 2025.\n\nIt announced it would integrate into the Carnival Cruise Line brand in June last year.\n\nMany of P&O's Explorer Cruises \u2014 vessels which travelled to regional ports \u2014 were summarily scrapped.\n\n\"That was a big decision for P&O, and that will be impactful to us here [in SA] \u2014 but we also know there are opportunities that present,\" Ms Bettison said.\n\n\"I'm going to be really up-front: there is going to be some challenges in the next two cruise seasons.\n\n\"But then we see these great opportunities of getting more diverse types of cruise ships.\"",

(ABC South West: Bridget McArthur)\n\nThe major parties have gone somewhat quiet on their respective development plans during the federal election campaign thus far.\n\nMeanwhile, the communities at the centre of these energy projects have been ramping up calls for more detail and demanding local candidates reveal where they stand.\n\nNuclear top of mind for region\n\nThe Coalition's nuclear energy policy has been a hot topic in the seat of O'Connor since Collie's retiring coal-fired power station was announced as one of seven proposed reactor sites.\n\nPeter Dutton walks past protesters to his waiting car in Collie. (ABC South West: Bridget McArthur)\n\nGeorgia Dowdell had just bought her and her young daughter's \"forever home\" down the road from the power plant when she heard the news.\n\nShe said the policy was a \"huge concern\" and would be on the minds of many Collie voters come May 3.\n\n\"I've always kind of stayed out of [politics] but now it's in my backyard \u2026 I'll most definitely be voting against it,\" Ms Dowdell said.\n\nGeorgia Dowdell is concerned a Coalition government would mean a nuclear reactor on her doorstep. (ABC South West: Bridget McArthur)\n\nFellow Collie resident Brian Kippin said he was in favour of the Coalition's plan, believing it filled an impending gap in baseload power and jobs, but acknowledged others had concerns.\n\n\"There are many people who are more supportive of renewables, but when you explain things, it opens their eyes up,\" he said.\n\nAbout 100 kilometres down the road in Bridgetown, John Manera said the nuclear policy had him rethinking his typically Liberal vote.\n\nHe said he was not opposed to nuclear energy, but he felt the plan was too expensive and lacked detail.\n\n\"Even though I've got a lot of reservations about Labor, I think they've probably got the better ideas as far as energy,\" Mr Manera said.\n\nLiberals fear nuclear could cost votes\n\nA number of prominent Liberal voices have spoken out against the Coalition's nuclear plan, including former party leaders Malcolm Turnbull and John Hewson.\n\nFormer Liberal candidate for the Tasmanian seat of Clarke (now Denison) Andrew Gregson said the policy was a death sentence for the party.\n\nHe has been advocating for it to be scrapped under the banner of the new advocacy group, Liberals Against Nuclear.\n\nPeter Dutton brought up nuclear twice in this year's budget reply speech. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\n\"We're still very hopeful that the Liberal Party leadership recognise that their nuclear policy is toxic,\" Mr Gregson said.\n\nNew data from the ABC's Vote Compass survey found about 47 per cent of more than 270,000 respondents disagreed with building nuclear power plants, while 38 per cent were supportive.\n\nUndecided voters were more likely to disagree.\n\nJohn Curtin Institute of Public Policy executive director John Phillimore said the fact Opposition Leader Peter Dutton had not brought up nuclear much in recent weeks could indicate an awareness it was not his party's most popular policy.\n\nJohn Phillimore says energy will be a key voter issue for the federal seats of O'Connor and Forrest. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nMr Dutton only mentioned nuclear twice in his latest budget reply speech \u2014 his first since the nuclear policy was announced \u2014 compared to eight times in his 2024 budget reply.\n\nOn a recent visit to Bunbury, federal Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor said his party wasn't backing away from the policy.\n\n\"I'm happy to say it.

(ABC News: Bridget McArthur)\n\nOffshore wind swaying votes\n\nIn the seat of Forrest, which covers most of the south-west coastline, Labor's 4,000-square-kilometre offshore wind project has rallied a strident protest group concerned about impacts to the marine ecosystem and recreational fishing.\n\nThe group's Facebook page has grown to more than 6,000 people, representing a small but vocal minority of about 110,000 local electors.\n\nTo campaigners' delight, Mr Dutton has promised to scrap the project, and locals are pursuing similar commitments from other candidates.\n\nPeter Dutton visited Busselton last year to announce the Liberals would axe Labor's WA offshore wind project if elected. (ABC South West: Bridget McArthur)\n\nAt a recent candidate forum in Busselton, audience members started heckling independent candidate Sue Chapman to decide \"yes or no\".\n\nMs Chapman chose to remain neutral, saying she would \"assess it based on the evidence and aim to bring the community along\".\n\nSue Chapman faces voters at a forum in Busselton. (ABC South West: Bridget McArthur)\n\nLeading the heckling was swinging voter and Busselton resident Mariah Goria, who said she could not vote for anyone supportive of the offshore wind proposal.\n\n\"If anyone goes ahead with offshore wind, they're going ahead with ignoring the community,\" Ms Goria said.\n\nLiberal candidate for Forrest Ben Small has been quick to leverage the issue, attacking Labor and the Greens candidates for their support, and Ms Chapman for fence-sitting.\n\nBen Small's opposition to offshore wind is the first thing visitors to his web page see.

        "text": "Lennard Walker's eyes widen as he recalls the roaring desert rain.\n\nLast year the Spinifex elder, who was born in the Great Victoria Desert, spent four days stranded on a dirt track in one of the most remote parts of the country.\n\nAlongside him was Noli Rictor, who lived a traditional nomadic life in the bush with his family until 1986, the last known Australians to do so.\n\nThe party of seven had set out from Kalgoorlie, 600 kilometres east of Perth, for their homes at Tjuntjuntjara (pronounced joon-joon-jara), a 10-hour drive further east.\n\nTjuntjuntjara is one of Australia's most remote communities. (ABC: Sharon Gordon)\n\nDespite their deep knowledge of the country, they were shocked at the downpour.\n\n\"Big rain,\" Mr Walker says, arms extended towards the sky.\n\n\"Really big rain.\n\n\"Stuck halfway.\"\n\nWhen they were finally rescued by a helicopter, the community breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nLennard Walker is a senior Pitjantjatjara law man. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\nBut their troubles were only just beginning.\n\nThe washed-out roads between Kalgoorlie and Tjuntjuntjara would remain closed for six months.\n\nThe only other access route, which takes 14 hours to travel from Ceduna, would often leave food delivery trucks bogged \u2014 five once became stranded in a single day \u2014 or needing thousands of dollars' worth of repairs.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe Anangu, or Spinifex People, are famous for their resilience, surviving atomic testing and the missionary era to return to their homelands in the 1980s.\n\nBut Jon Lark, chief executive of the Paupiyala Tjarutja Aboriginal Corporation (PTAC), which manages Tjuntjuntjara on behalf of the Spinifex People, says current pressures are pushing the community to its limit.\n\nLennard Walker and his party were stranded in WA's flooded outback. (Supplied: Jon Lark)\n\nReturning to country\n\nTjuntjuntjara was born of a dream from its old people, desperate to return to their country after years of displacement.\n\nWhite settlers had built missions, launched rockets and, from 1953, tested nuclear weapons at Maralinga and Emu Field within range of their land.\n\nSpinifex elder Ned Grant, who spent his early years crisscrossing the desert country of Western Australia's interior before ending up at Cundeelee Mission, was part of the homelands movement.\n\nNed Grant is a senior elder who helped lead the return to country. (ABC Goldfields: Katrina Tap)\n\nWhen the mission closed, and the state government bought a cattle station called Coonana, thinking former residents would run it, they seized the opportunity to return.\n\n\"[Tjuntjuntjara] is closer to home, where he grew up, Spinifex country,\" Tjuntjuntjara resident Donna Marie Brown said, translating Mr Grant's Pitjantjatjara.\n\nIn 2000 the Spinifex People became the first in Western Australia to achieve native title, using artworks to demonstrate their 25,000-year-old connection to country.\n\nYet 25 years on, profound challenges remain.\n\nTjuntjuntjara remains home to elders who led the return to country in the 1980s. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\n'I can't have a shower'\n\nShona Jamieson's kitchen, toilet and shower have been blocked for months.\n\nThe Tjuntjuntjara woman has long been proud of her independence, working numerous jobs and living alone with her dogs.\n\nShona Jamieson must go to neighbours' houses to access a shower and toilet. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\nBut she has no option but to rely on others for basic facilities.\n\n\"I can't have a shower, I can't go toilet. I can't cook something in the kitchen,\" she said.\n\nThe WA Department of Communities is arranging for a plumber to visit.\n\nJon Lark believes Tjuntjuntjara needs far more support. (ABC Goldfields: Jarrod Lucas)\n\nThe community faces similar hurdles with air conditioning.\n\nIn January, Tjuntjuntjara sweltered through 19 days above 40 degrees Celsius.\n\nMr Lark, who has worked with the Spinifex at different times since 1987, estimated about a third of houses had no functioning air conditioning and others were cut off when pre-paid power expired.\n\nHe said the hot, overcrowded houses put elderly, ill residents at risk and could lead to broader social problems.\n\nBut among the services Tjuntjuntjara lacks is local police.\n\nTjuntjuntjara is 700 kilometres north-east of Kalgoorlie. (Supplied)\n\n\"There are increasing social issues \u2026 about substance abuse and domestic violence and safety,\" Mr Lark said.\n\n\" And what the people see as an answer is a greater police presence. \"\n\nA WA Police spokesperson did not comment on resourcing, but said it flew personnel to the community in emergencies.\n\nMr Lark said while police had once visited every six weeks, their schedule was interrupted by last year's floods.\n\nHe worried that extreme weather would continue to make all kinds of service delivery more challenging.\n\nFood security is a massive challenge for the people of Tjuntjuntjara. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\n'We need a big one'\n\nFood was flown in twice at the state government's expense when roads were out of action last year.\n\nBut the community's 30-year-old shop, with a tin shed for storage, could only hold a small amount in reserve.\n\nLocal resident Lawrence Minning said they needed more space.\n\nLawrence Minning wants a bigger store in Tjuntjuntjara. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\n\"It's too small,\" he said. \"We need a big one.\n\n\" [And it's] too dear, going up. They should drop [prices] down. \"\n\nWhen the ABC visited earlier this month, a small can of tuna was $5.30, two litres of cordial was $8.49, and a four-pack of pies was $14.99 \u2014 compared to $2.70, $4.40 and $9 for the same products at a major supermarket.\n\nFood prices are much higher in Tjuntjuntjara than most parts of Australia. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\n\"The shop is dear,\" Anangu woman Ms Brown said, with Mr Grant nodding in agreement.\n\n\" You've got to go in with $300 or $250 to buy a lot of food. \"\n\nMr Lark said the extreme freight and fuel costs required to get food to Tjuntjuntjara \u2014 via Alice Springs, Adelaide and Ceduna \u2014 added to the high prices.\n\nEvery fortnight, workers rally to unload the food truck. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\nLast year locals worried food and fuel trucks might stop running altogether because the delivery route was so treacherous.\n\nFollowing crisis meetings, Main Roads WA committed $6 million to improve roads to both Kalgoorlie and South Australia.\n\nThe work is expected to occur later this year.\n\nThe Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) said it might reimburse agencies for flood damage repairs along the road to Kalgoorlie, but said the road to South Australia was not government owned or managed and therefore was ineligible.\n\nMr Lark said he worried the roads would remain just as vulnerable to future extreme weather events.\n\nAcclaimed artist Timo Hogan fixes a car on the road to Tjuntjuntjara. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\nFederal party promises\n\nFederal Labor said it would subsidise 30 key products at many remote community stores from July, as part of its 10-year strategy to improve food security.\n\n\"We know that remote First Nations communities are vulnerable to extreme weather conditions, making them disproportionately impacted by food insecurity,\" a spokesperson said.\n\nThey also invited PTAC to apply for a Local Investments Funding grant to improve roads.\n\nWorkers unload the fortnightly grocery delivery. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\nBut a Coalition spokesperson said the food security strategy lacked detail.\n\nIf elected, they vowed the Coalition would reduce cost-of-living pressures by halving the fuel excise and offering cheaper energy.\n\nThey said the Regional Australia Future Fund would ensure money was available for fixing roads and improving supply routes.\n\nMr Lark said he hoped to meet with newly elected federal government representatives after next month's vote.\n\nThe WA government has set aside $6m to upgrade Tjuntjuntjara's access roads. (Supplied/ABC: Katrina Tap)\n\n'Watch this space'\n\nDespite its challenges, many locals would never leave Tjuntjuntjara.\n\n\"The old people were absolutely adamant to return to this place,\" Mr Lark said.\n\n\" And they're adamant they're going to stay. \"\n\nPeople love spending time in the bush surrounding Tjuntjuntjara. (ABC Goldfields: Katrina Tap)\n\nHe said although younger residents went away to boarding school, many had returned.\n\nThe community is known throughout the central desert for the strength of its culture, with people regularly heading out bush for hunting, ranger work and cultural business.\n\nIts artists are internationally acclaimed, with Noli Rictor winning the top award at the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Awards last year, and fellow local Timo Hogan winning it three years earlier.\n\nNoli Rictor with his winning painting (left); Patju Presely painting a large canvas. (Supplied: Olivia Sproull/Amanda Dent)\n\nAnother elder, Patju Presley, has a three-metre painting in the Australian embassy in Washington DC, and the WA Museum has showcased a major Spinifex Arts Project exhibition for months.\n\n\"Pukulpa,\" Mr Grant said, describing his Tjuntjuntjara life.\n\n\"It means he's happy,\" Ms Brown translated.\n\n\"He's on country, you know.\"\n\nTjuntjuntjara residents regularly spend time on country. (ABC Goldfields: Katrina Tap)\n\nBut Mr Lark said unless support from all tiers of government improved, the Spinifex People would suffer, due to the challenges of remaining in community or the fresh ones that came with leaving.\n\n\"People's experience of going to live in metropolitan areas and regional towns isn't always a positive improvement, so I guess it's just watch this space.\n\n\"We can only hope that the \u2026 plans that we're implementing are going to have success.\"",

        "text": "It was the \"super-storm\" that shocked the tight-knit rural town of Dungog, inland from Newcastle, on the morning of April 21, 2015.\n\nMore than 300 millimetres of rain rapidly fell on the town, and water from the Myall Creek rushed toward homes and businesses.\n\nThree locals lost their lives: Colin Webb, 79, Robin MacDonald, 68, and Brian Wilson, 72.\n\nDungog bore the brunt of the storm and was cut off by floodwaters. (Supplied: Rural Fire Service)\n\nMr Webb and Mr Wilson died at the Alison Court aged care community, with a neighbour trying desperately to help.\n\nMs MacDonald died at her home on nearby Hooke Street.\n\n\"The loss is as immense today as it was 10 years ago,\" said Sarah U'Brien, who runs the local community centre and was at the forefront of its response in 2015.\n\n\"We sit with great loss and sorrow of what was taken from us so suddenly, but we also know that we came through this together.\n\n\" The true community spirit of Dungog shines ... it's one of optimism and hope. \"\n\nSarah U'Brien (left), Mayor Digby Rayward and the council's Tracey Lowrey agree that hope got Dungog through the tragedy. (ABC Newcastle: Bridget Murphy)\n\nCritical improvements\n\nA 2017 coronial inquest into the deaths of Mr Wilson, Mr Webb and Ms MacDonald found the floods could not have been predicted.\n\nDungog Shire Council emergency management officer Tracey Lowrey, who has called Dungog home for four decades, said the region had learned about the importance of being prepared.\n\n\"I think overall, Dungog shire has come a long way,\" she said.\n\n\"We seem to have running [weather] events now ... before 2015, we would average maybe one event a year.\n\n\"The ability to have networks and develop them within communities is really important for council and also for community.\"\n\nShe said there was a focus on establishing more community emergency networks across the region to make sure vulnerable and small towns were ready for future events.\n\nThe Dungog township is better prepared for future emergencies. (ABC Newcastle: Bridget Murphy)\n\nNSW State Emergency Service Assistant Commissioner Nicole Hogan said all recommendations from the 2017 inquest had been implemented, including the installation of a flood monitoring system along the Myall Creek.\n\n\"The NSW SES also now has a dedicated meteorologist and a hydrologist from the Bureau of Meteorology based in our state operations centre permanently to aid with detailed observations and forecasts,\" she said in a statement.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Hogan said the SES had carried out more training for volunteers and had improved the availability of emergency response crews and equipment in the Hunter.\n\nThe 2015 flood was widespread in the Hunter Valley. (ABC News)\n\nShe also said the service had \"introduced the Australian Warning System to better prepare and alert the community before, during and after disasters\".\n\n\"The SES has worked closely with the Dungog Shire Council to finalise a Local Flood Emergency Sub Plan, outlining emergency management arrangements for prevention, preparation, response, and initial recovery for flooding in the region.\"\n\nShe said there were now 12 members assigned to the Dungog Unit, and they were actively recruiting for a new unit commander at Dungog.\n\nPower of art\n\nArt has played an important role in helping Dungog over the past decade.\n\nThe Project Bounce Forward exhibition was shown on the first anniversary of the flood in 2016.\n\nGroups impacted by the flood, like the Alison Court community, chose words they felt reflected them and posed for photographs with them.\n\nResidents of Dungog's Alison Court photographed in 2016. (ABC Newcastle: Bridget Murphy)\n\nTo mark the 10th anniversary, those photographs will be re-exhibited at the local library for a week.\n\n\"We wanted to recognise the pain, the trauma, the suffering and the deep loss that had been felt by so many, but we also really wanted to make sure that, from that, we grew,\" Ms U'Brien said.\n\n\" They are joyful photos. You can't help but smile with courage and pride of what our community went through and the grace and dignity that they created for themselves and others. \"\n\nDungog's Anglican Church will hold a community reflection and memorial service at 6pm this evening.",

        "text": "Kicking up the dust at this tiny outback town's annual rodeo at the weekend had never felt more important.\n\nTales of dead livestock, helicopter rescues and flooded properties were told around Eromanga's arena, which was under water only a few weeks ago.\n\nRingers travelled from local stations to attend the rodeo. (ABC Western Qld: Julia Andre)\n\nThe community, 1,060 kilometres west of Brisbane, is one of many in the south-west picking up the pieces after raging floodwaters ripped through the land.\n\nEromanga's Easter Rodeo came as a much-needed morale boost for its residents.\n\nLinda Evans was distraught to lose six horses in the floods. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nEvent coordinator Linda Evans said the rodeo was the first opportunity locals had had to blow off some steam and debrief.\n\n\" Just to know that your mates are there, just ring or yell out, otherwise you'll just bottle it up and mental health's no joke. \"\n\nMs Evans is a fierce woman \u2014 ask anyone in Eromanga and they'll tell you she's not to be messed with.\n\nLinda Evans keeping things under control in the rodeo arena. (ABC Western Qld: Julia Andre)\n\nBut Ms Evans sheds an uncharacteristic tear as she speaks about her six horses that were swept up in floodwaters and drowned.\n\n\"It was tough but that's one of the biggest reasons we decided this had to happen.\n\n\" We know how bad we felt and I'm sure there's a hell of a lot of other people that felt that bad or worse. \"\n\nSome locals still haven't been able to come to terms with their losses. (ABC Western Qld: Julia Andre)\n\nThe rodeo's cattle were supplied by the nearby station Ms Evans and her partner manage, even though its owners are still counting the cost of the floods.\n\nNumbers at the event were down compared to previous years because many roads that connect nearby towns remain closed.\n\nAround 200 people gathered at the rodeo on Saturday. (ABC Western Qld: Julia Andre)\n\nIn this part of the country, properties are hundreds of thousands of acres in size.\n\nIt can be weeks before you see your neighbour, which is why the locals were so grateful to catch up with old mates at the rodeo.\n\nStock agent Sam Bartlett said he was relieved the rodeo went ahead, despite the uncertainty.\n\n\"It's just good to see everyone, have a drink and everyone's got a smile on their face.\"\n\nLocal families attended the rodeo, coming together after the floods. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nMr Bartlett said despite the recent devastation, he was positive about the region's future.\n\n\"We're starting to see the feed grow which is great.\n\n\" Everyone's resilient, there's a good bunch of young people out here and we will rebuild. \"\n\nThe rodeo took place over the Easter weekend. (ABC Western Qld: Julia Andre)\n\nTough rebuild\n\nWhile some areas are seeing the spoils of rain, other grazing land has been devastated.\n\nOn Kyabra Station, 50km north of Eromanga, the torrents of floodwater were so strong they stripped away the top layer of soil.\n\nEromanga is looking green after the floods. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nThere is white sand on the property, and caretaker Maurice Philips said he had no idea where it came from.\n\nThe floodwaters came up to the homestead's steps and Mr Philips drove his car up onto the verandah to keep its motor dry.\n\nMaurice Philips's ute became bogged in Kyabra Station's mud. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nBut that wasn't the biggest challenge; he spent a couple of hours stuck in a tree after trying to go out to rescue animals in a tinny as the floodwaters rose.\n\n\"It didn't have enough power to go upstream; they spotted me in a chopper and sent a jetski out to pick me up,\" he recounted.\n\nMr Philips said the water came in like \"a broom\", sweeping dead animals across the vast outback landscape and trapping others in fencing.\n\nTop soil being stripped away will make it hard for feed to grow back. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nKyabra Station's losses are close to $1 million.\n\n\"All you can do is pull the machinery out of the mud and chuck it because it sat in water for 10 days,\" Mr Philips said.\n\nOnto his fourth pair of shoes because the mud is so thick, the caretaker is determined to keep going.\n\n'Community will get us through'\n\nMany locals have not had time to catch up as they recover from the floods. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nBack in Eromanga, Ms Evans said she was certain the community would rebuild stronger, despite what they had been through.\n\n\"That's what people in the bush do, they don't back down too easy out here.\n\n\" Everyone's supporting one another so much, that's what the rodeo was about \u2014 it's not about anything other than our community. \"",

(Getty Images: Caroline McCredie)\n\nIt marks the latest headache for Cryptoloc and its founder Jamie Wilson, who attended ritzy events with stars and politicians, and whose ventures donated more than $320,000 to both sides of politics.\n\nCryptoloc Holdings' collapse so soon after winning a tender also raises questions about due diligence.\n\nQuestions raised over 'stability' of Cryptoloc Holdings\n\nBrisbane-born Mr Wilson's venture stretches back 15 years and was marketed as a way of storing documents in a hacker-proof online environment. The idea spawned from Mr Wilson's scramble to find documents during a family tragedy.\n\nHe raised funds from investors but entities including Cryptoloc Holdings, whose sole director is also Mr Wilson, split from the head company last year. Some Cryptoloc companies remain active.\n\nAn ABC investigation in November revealed another of Mr Wilson's Cryptoloc-associated companies had gone into liquidation owing taxpayers almost $2 million. (Supplied)\n\nCryptoloc Holdings was selected to run a $15 million program to boost small businesses cybersecurity, announced in the last days of the Queensland Labor administration.\n\nCourt documents show two days later, Cryptoloc Holdings issued an initial $1.762 million invoice. Up to $5 million was allocated for the company over several years.\n\nBut an ABC investigation in November revealed another of Mr Wilson's Cryptoloc-associated companies had gone into liquidation owing taxpayers almost $2 million, and Mr Wilson had admitted in an affidavit to cash-flow problems with paying wages.\n\nJamie Wilson's Your Digital File may have traded insolvent, liquidator says Photo shows A woman and a man on skype call with the words lessons the hard way A liquidator says technology entrepreneur Jamie Wilson, who was repeatedly nominated for a businessperson of the year award, headed a company that may have traded while insolvent.\n\nThe government's lawyers at Clayton Utz asked Cryptoloc Holdings that month about the ABC report and staff issues.\n\n\"These matters raise questions for the department over the stability of Cryptoloc, the accuracy of financial information provided by it,\" said the letter.\n\nThe department found directorship and the legal owner of most shares in the company had changed.\n\nThe change was from Mr Wilson to a woman at the business. It was changed in the month after the tender was won.\n\nThese changes were not disclosed to the department, which it said damaged \"trust and confidence between the parties\".\n\nWilson says 'no intent to deceive'\n\nMr Wilson, who later resumed the sole directorship, initially replied the changes were necessary to protect Cryptoloc because \"a third party with significant influence has taken offence to Jamie personally\".\n\n\"There was no intent to deceive but rather to work with the department to protect this critical program,\" he wrote.\n\nPoliticians sang the praises of a tech startup. Then it collapsed Photo shows A watermarked photo of a bald man wearing a suit and bow tie. A tech entrepreneur who linked arms with politicians and celebrities has had a company wound up over unpaid bills.\n\nHe also said Cryptoloc Holdings had unsuccessfully tried communicating the corporate changes to the department, while his other company's liquidation was a \"mutual\" decision with the Australian Taxation Office.\n\n\"We are unsure why the department has adopted such a combative stance toward a project that is on track,\" he wrote.\n\nHe also wrote $1.247 million had been spent on the program.\n\nThe department's lawyers upped the pressure, questioning spending on subcontractors without government consent, a budgeted $10,000 on a \"Champions Network\", and Mr Wilson having told an external auditor he was in Sydney.\n\n\"Contrary to Mr Wilson's representation, he has in fact been overseas during the past week,\" one email said.\n\nBy mid-December, lawyers complained Cryptoloc Holdings was in breach of information requests.\n\nJamie Wilson speaking at the Cancer Council fundraising ball. (Supplied)\n\n\"You have failed to confirm that Cryptoloc is able and willing to complete the contract in extraordinary circumstances where it has supplied a false address for business, has shut down its website and extraordinarily failed or refused to respond to multiple communications,\" the email said.\n\nThe state contract was terminated in early January, with the government demanding $1.513 million \u2014 the amount initially sent, minus some expenses.\n\n'How is it that they stuffed up so badly?'\n\nNew Small Business Minister Steve Minnikin, of the LNP, declined interview requests, but his office told the ABC: \"An internal audit associated with the tender and associated processes will be undertaken by the department.\"\n\n\"The department has also made representations to (the Australian Securities and Investments Commission) and the ATO,\" his office said.\n\nSteve Minnikin said an internal audit associated with the tender would be undertaken by the department. (ABC News: Rachel Riga)\n\nThe department and minister have refused access to an ABC right to information filing for documents related to the tender process.\n\nFormer Labor small business minister Lance McCallum, who announced the tender win, declined interview requests. An opposition spokesman said the department independently awarded the contract.\n\nPeter Deans, a risk expert with Notwithoutrisk Consulting, said due diligence checks include understanding a company's financial stability and track record of directors.\n\n\"Engaging a start-up, particularly in these technology areas, is again somewhat riskier than if you were contracting with a large multinational corporate to build a bridge,\" he said.\n\nMr Wilson donated more than $320,000 to both sides of politics. (Supplied)\n\nA post-mortem should look at what went wrong with a failed contract.\n\n\"It's not a common event and certainly something the governments would want to avoid,\" Mr Deans said.\n\nGreens parliamentarian Michael Berkman told the ABC questions surrounded the contract win for a company with links to political donations to both sides.\n\n\"How is it that they stuffed it up so badly? That the contract's been awarded, and within months, weeks of that, the company's fallen over,\" he said.\n\n\"We clearly need some tighter processes around whether or not tenderers for projects like this actually have the capacity to deliver.\n\n\"I think there's an even deeper question to ask about whether we should be getting the state to develop its own capacity to deliver on projects.\"\n\nMr Berkman said questions surrounded the contract win for a company with links to political donations to both sides. (ABC News)\n\nMr Wilson and Cryptoloc companies are listed on donation records as spending at least $320,000 on major parties, including $18,040 with the ALP in August 2024 and $22,000 with the LNP in 2022. His business also hired LNP powerbroker Santo Santoro as a lobbyist.\n\nMinisterial diaries and social media show Mr Wilson meeting politicians, including Labor's then-deputy premier Steven Miles and LNP Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner.

        "text": "A brilliant opening manoeuvre from Oscar Piastri has won him the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix and the lead in the Formula 1 drivers' championship.\n\nIt is the first time an Australian has led the drivers' championship for 15 years, following his manager Mark Webber in 2010.\n\nAt turn one, Piastri nipped inside Max Verstappen, who had begun the race on pole, resulting in the Dutchman driving off the road to reclaim the lead.\n\nHe was subsequently given a five-second penalty enabling Piastri to regain the lead when the Red Bull rider pitted, and hold onto it all the way to the chequered flag.\n\nVerstappen was 2.843 seconds behind, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc making up the podium.\n\nPiastri's McLaren teammate Lando Norris, who began in 10th after crashing in qualifying, came fourth. Australian rookie Jack Doohan finished 17th in his Alpine with 18 finishing.\n\nMcLaren has won four of five races to start the season, with Piastri winning three. (Sam Bagnall/Sutton Images)\n\nAfter winning in Bahrain last week, 24-year-old Piastri is the first back-to-back winner this season and the new favourite for the title.\n\nIt is early days, with only five races run, but after a disappointing ninth in the opening race in Melbourne, Piastri is the form driver, having won in Shanghai, Bahrain and Jeddah, and finished third in Suzuka.\n\n\"[It was a] great race. We did the parts we needed to do right,\" Piastri said.\n\n\"It was a pretty tough race, one of the toughest in my career,\" he added, \"after 50 laps in temperatures of around a super-fast track.\"\n\nEvery previous race this season, including China's sprint, had been won from pole but Piastri made an early bid to change that as he got a great launch off the line and moved to the inside of Verstappen.\n\nThe Dutchman dived across the run-off area and stayed ahead, with Piastri on the radio to say: \"He needs to give that back, I was ahead.\"\n\nVerstappen's view was: \"He forced me off, there was no intention from him to make that corner.\"\n\nThe stewards sided with Piastri as Verstappen received a five-second penalty. \"Well that is f*****g lovely,\" Verstappen said.\n\nPiastri (right) got the inside line on pole-sitter Max Verstappen (left) on the first turn.\n\n\"Once I got on the inside, I wasn't coming out of turn one in second. In the end, that's what won us the race today,\" Piastri said at the finish.\n\nSubsequently Verstappen said he could not share his true feelings as \"people can't handle the truth\".\n\n\"It is better not to talk about it,\" he said.\n\n\"Anything I say may get me into trouble. Sometimes your words can be twisted or interpreted in a different way.\n\n\"You can't share your opinions because it's not appreciated as it used to be. People can't handle the truth.\"\n\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner printed out photos to show reporters, saying they proved Verstappen had the right of way heading into the corner and his driver should not have been penalised.\n\n\"At the apex of the corner, we believe that Max is clearly ahead,\" Horner said.\n\n\"I can't see how they got to that conclusion. I don't know what happened to, 'Let them race'. That seems to have been abandoned.\"\n\nPiastri, unsurprisingly, disagreed.\n\nMcLaren's Oscar Piastri was all smiles after winning the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. (Reuters: Jakub Porzycki)\n\n\"I knew I had enough of my car in front to take the first corner,\" Piastri said.\n\n\"I braked as late as I could stay on the track. The way it was dealt with was the right thing.\"\n\nFurther back, Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly banged wheels and were both out, forcing a first-lap safety car.\n\nOscar Piastri wins F1 Bahrain Grand Prix Photo shows Oscar Piastri with the Bahrain Grand Prix winner's trophy Oscar Piastri has driven a flawless race from pole position to win the Bahrain Grand Prix, his second win this Formula 1 season.\n\nVerstappen got the jump on Piastri at the restart as the McLaren was forced to defend from George Russell, who would later come fifth in the Mercedes.\n\nPiastri pitted on lap 19, trailing by nearly 3 seconds, with Verstappen in two laps later. The Dutchman served his penalty and emerged 3 seconds behind.\n\nOn his out lap, Piastri completed a sensational overtake on Lewis Hamilton.\n\nOnce he gained clean air ahead of Verstappen, Piastri showcased the might of the McLaren to cruise to victory and the four-time world champion Red Bull driver could only marvel at the Australian's composure in just his third season.\n\n\"He's very calm in his approach, and I like that,\" Verstappen said.\n\n\"It shows on track. He delivers when he has to, barely makes mistakes \u2014 and that's what you need when you want to fight for a championship.\n\n\"I think with Mark [Webber] by his side, he's helping him a lot. It's great. People learn from their own careers \u2014 that's what I had with my dad, and Mark is advising Oscar.\n\n\"At the end of the day, Oscar is using his talent, and that's great to see.\"\n\nPiastri now has 99 points to Norris's 89 and Verstappen's 87. Champions McLaren stretched their lead over Mercedes in the constructors' standings to 77 points.\n\nThe next race is in Miami on May 4.\n\nAAP/ABC",

        "text": "But Leto says much bolder reforms are needed to convince voters under 45 years that major parties are \u201cfully invested\u201d in dealing with the challenges they face. \u201cBoomers and Gen X voters grew up with housing that was affordable, benefited from reforms like Medicare, superannuation and a suite of government policies that allowed them to raise families, retire with good incomes and comfortably contribute to the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout serious action, the picture isn\u2019t as pretty for younger generations.\u201d Shannon Said, a 35-year-old mental health clinician from Mount Druitt, says young people in western Sydney haven\u2019t benefited meaningfully from government investments and feel a sense of \u201cfutility\u201d about politics. Millennial voter Shannon Said predicts many young people in Western Sydney will vote for Greens and independents. Credit: Thomas Wielecki \u201cHow often have these parties actually met with young people and engaged with them meaningfully, not just for a few photos and a few news appearances?\u201d he says. \u201cAre you coming down to places where youth are and actually engaging with what they\u2019re saying? I don\u2019t see that.\u201d\n\nSaid is planning to vote for an independent. \u201cI think we\u2019re probably going to see a lot of voting for the Greens and independents because they seem to be more in tune with what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says. Opinion polls show Labor and the Coalition are struggling to win over younger voters; a Resolve Political Monitor (RPM) survey published earlier this month showed only 56 per cent of those aged 18-35 backed one of the two majors. That compares with 74 per cent support for the Coalition and Labor among those aged over 55. Jim Reed, who conducts the Resolve Political Monitor published by this masthead, says young voters have been hit hard by cost-of-living pressures and a lack of affordable housing.\n\n\u201cYounger people tend to earn less when they\u2019re starting out, and rental prices have hampered their ability to crack property ownership too,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder this group is voting for change via minor parties and independents, and staying there for longer than they used to. They don\u2019t see solutions coming from the major parties.\u201d Lukas Galanto is another young voter unconvinced by what major parties are offering. \u201cI see myself voting more independent \u2026 it just doesn\u2019t really feel like the bigger parties have actual interest in the local communities,\u201d says the 21-year-old who rents in Castle Hill. Much of the information Galanto receives about the election comes via social media.\n\nYoung voters Lukas Galanto and Mara Board Credit: Thomas Wielecki \u201cEvery now and then I do see [politicians on my social media], but it\u2019s never about what they\u2019re planning to do, it\u2019s always what the other party isn\u2019t doing,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like they\u2019re fighting instead of actually telling you kind of the plans they have for you.\u201d His friend Mara Board, a 21-year-old university student, feels politicians are not \u201cdoing much for people our age; they don\u2019t really talk to us.\u201d Board, who lives as St Mary\u2019s, is especially pessimistic about her homeownership prospects. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to afford Sydney when it is that time to get a job and move out,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Australian Election Study (AES), which has surveyed voters after each election since the mid-1980s, shows the behaviour of Millennial and Gen Z voters differs from previous generations. Only about one in four voters under the age of 40 reported voting for the Coalition at the 2022 federal election. \u201cAt no time in the 35-year history of the AES have we observed such a low level of support for either major party in so large a segment of the electorate,\u201d the study said. The share of under-40s voting for the ALP in 2022 was 38 per cent, unchanged from 2019. \u201cThe evidence shows that political partisanship among younger generations is lower than it has been in the past for both Labor and Liberal,\u201d says Griffith University\u2019s Dr Sarah Cameron, a chief investigator on the AES. \u201cIt\u2019s higher, however, for the Greens.\u201d\n\nThe latest electoral roll data published by the Australian Electoral Commission shows the seat of Greenway in Sydney\u2019s north-western suburbs has the city\u2019s highest share of Millennial and Gen Z voters at 54 per cent followed by the neighbouring electorate of Chifley (53 per cent). Loading The inner-city electorate of Sydney is the only seat outside the western suburbs where Millennials and Gen Z are the majority of voters (52 per cent). Major differences in age profiles are emerging across Australian electorates as the population ages. The seat of Greenway has only 10,315 voters over the age of 70 while in Mackellar there are over 26,592 voters in that age group, the latest election roll data shows. The share of older voters is much higher in many regional electorates. In the north coast NSW seat of Lynne there are 36,580 voters aged over 70 and in the marginal south coast electorate of Gilmore there are 34,593 voters in that age group.",

He got a better start than Verstappen off the line, led down the inside into turn one, and the only way Verstappen could stay in front was to leave the track. The race stewards saw it and slugged Verstappen with a five-second penalty that he needn\u2019t have served if he gave the on-track position straight back.",

        "text": "Loading My Marriage Sabbatical: A Memoir of Solo Travel and Lasting Love is a record of Fisher\u2019s exploration of travel and personal growth, visiting Costa Rica, Guatemala, Ecuador, Cuba, Bali, Java and Colombia. It\u2019s some journey, full of risk and volunteer work. Fisher, who is a marriage counsellor, took Charley along on a few trips, and there were other, regular reunions in Arizona. But Fisher also told Charley that he could see other women in her absence. That changed when Charley announced that he\u2019d formed an emotional attachment to another woman and said he would like to see her. Surprise: Fisher realised that she wasn\u2019t as open to open marriage as she had believed. Her therapist pronounced: \u201cThis is the stupidest plan I\u2019ve heard about in a long time!\u201d So ended the sexual experiment, but not Fisher\u2019s leave-taking for solo travel or her irritation with her husband when they were together. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten sick of each other,\u201d Fisher informed Charley before setting off on the final leg of her sabbatical. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cI think we\u2019ve gotten lonely for each other.\u201d Eventually, Fisher sees the value of both her flawed relationship and her time away from it. \u201cWhat neither Charley nor I realised when we agreed to be apart for a year,\u201d she concludes, \u201cwas that we were in the process of reconfiguring our marriage. We were experimenting with a different version of matrimony, one that was flexible and spacious enough to support independent dreams as well as those we shared.\u201d\n\nThe unnamed narrator of Miranda July\u2019s wildly popular \u2013 and divisive \u2013 novel All Fours makes Fisher\u2019s real-life marital pause seem positively Amish. July\u2019s heroine takes a road-trip detour from her marriage and motherhood to plumb her sexuality, identity and appetite for interior decorating. Her plan is to drive across the country. Instead, she spends $20,000 refashioning a motel room a few miles from her Los Angeles home while panting after incongruous lust objects. Loading Divorce, in the narrator\u2019s view, is for ordinary folk. \u201cRumours began to swirl around Harris and me \u2013 most people thought we were getting divorced,\u201d July writes. \u201cThis made me irate. \u2018Divorce only reinforces the supremacy of marriage!\u2019 \u201d True, but only if you decide to wed in the first place. The narrator is too rarefied to be in something as pedestrian as a conventionally constructed marriage. By the novel\u2019s end, she has a girlfriend, her husband has a girlfriend, and whatever remains of their union is quite different but better, with less suffering.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting formality that had been there since day two had simply lifted like a depression, a cloud of steam, and what remained was a pair of old kids who knew each other very well,\u201d July writes. Readers tend to adore All Fours or wish to fling it against a wall. July\u2019s ambition is impressive and her plot often inventive, but this is one self-absorbed, careless and tiresome heroine, whose bio shares much with the author\u2019s. Still, July\u2019s book, a finalist for a National Book Award and the Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction, is a bestseller that continues to spark conversation on the eve of its paperback publication. People (that would be women) want to talk about what\u2019s wrong with marriage and share, sometimes to the point of TMI, about creative ways to fix it. See also last year\u2019s More: A Memoir of Open Marriage, by Molly Roden Winter, a married non-monogamous Brooklyn mom, and Ada Calhoun\u2019s recent novel, Crush, in which the protagonist\u2019s husband (inspired by Jessica Fern\u2019s 2020 book, Polysecure) suggests the couple flirt with other people while keeping those rings on their fingers. Jessica Stanley\u2019s forthcoming novel, Consider Yourself Kissed, doesn\u2019t waste any time catching this zeitgeist. Her protagonist, Australian Coralie, announces her intention to take a break from a 10-year relationship with Englishman Adam in the second paragraph. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t love, she was half a person. But if she did love, she\u2019d never be whole,\u201d Stanley writes. \u201cMother, writer, worker, sister, friend, citizen, daughter, (sort of) wife. If she could be one, perhaps she could manage. Trying to be all, she found that she was none.\u201d The couple live together, have children together, but never wed. It only feels like they have. So this is more of a relationship sabbatical. As domesticity starts to crush her, Coralie craves not a room of one\u2019s own but, this being London, a flat.",

The pledges range from playgrounds for kindergartens to lighting at multiple sports fields.\n\nAmelia Hamer, the Liberal candidate for Kooyong, with young footballers at Glenferrie Oval this month. Credit: Joe Armao\n\nThe latest promise came on Saturday, where Hamer was joined by Liberal state MPs to announce \u201cresurfacing and safety upgrades\u201d to three stretches of state-managed arterials roads in Kooyong: Glenferrie Road (between Cotham and Wattletree roads), Cotham/Whitehorse Road (between Kew Junction and Union Road) and Balwyn Road (between Doncaster and Canterbury roads).\n\nThe announcement also includes the installation of a pedestrian crossing on Barkers Road in Kew (a council road) at the intersection of Haines Street and Edgevale Road.\n\n\u201cToo often I hear about the fact that a well-used road has more potholes each year, but no work has been done to fix them. This isn\u2019t good enough and we can do better,\u201d Hamer said in the announcement.\n\nJess Wilson, John Pesutto and Michael O\u2019Brien \u2013 the state Liberal MPs for Kew, Hawthorn and Malvern, respectively \u2013 appeared in Hamer\u2019s social media post announcing the funding \u2013 as did the sole remaining Liberal councillor at Boroondara Council, Felicity Sinfield.\n\nIn the media release for the announcement, the state MPs accused the Allan government of ignoring requests for upgrades and suggested Ryan had no leverage to get funding for community projects.\n\n\u201cThe state government has failed to listen, and the federal member isn\u2019t listened to \u2013 but Amelia Hamer will actually deliver,\u201d Pesutto said.\n\nLoading\n\nWhen asked under what criteria the roads were chosen, a Liberal campaign spokeswoman said: \u201cRoads were selected based on community feedback and the failure of both the Albanese and Allan Labor governments to invest in road upgrades across Melbourne and regional Victoria.\n\n\u201cOur Victorian infrastructure commitments will be delivered in partnership with state and local governments.\u201d\n\nA Victorian government spokeswoman acknowledged the state had received a petition for the pedestrian crossing from Wilson, but had not received any formal requests from local MPs or councils to repair the three stretches of state roads named in the funding pledge.\n\nRyan described the Liberals\u2019 funding announcements in her electorate as pork-barrelling.\n\n\u201cRolling out pre-election promises of money for infrastructure projects is a tired major party trope. It didn\u2019t work for Josh Frydenberg in 2022,\u201d she said on Sunday, referencing the infamous commuter car parks scandal.\n\nIn March 2022, Frydenberg, then the Kooyong MP and then federal treasurer, announced that four commuter car parks would no longer go ahead in Kooyong, following community consultation, three years after they were promised during the 2019 election campaign. The Australian National Audit Office had criticised the former Coalition government\u2019s allocation of money from the fund for favouring Liberal seats.\n\n\u201cMore than 80 per cent of Australians see pork-barrelling as a form of corruption: I think that figure would be higher in Kooyong,\u201d Ryan said on Sunday in response to Hamer\u2019s full list of pledges.\n\nRyan also claimed several of the projects the Liberal Party had announced funding for were already funded or had not been raised with the two council areas they fall within, although her office would not reveal which projects she was referring to.\n\n\u201cThe Kooyong community wants funding for sporting grounds and community infrastructure projects to be allocated transparently and fairly,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working collaboratively with Boroondara and Stonnington councils to find support for the projects they\u2019ve identified as high priority, on the basis of their detailed, evidence-based assessments.\u201d\n\nAll of Hamer\u2019s commitments for the Stonnington council area were requests made in the council\u2019s official election advocacy document. A spokesman for Boroondara council said all four sport projects announced by Hamer in the municipality were all priority projects that the council already planned to deliver regardless of the outcome of the federal election.\n\n\u201c[But] where aligned with existing Council priorities, co-contributions from other levels of government allows projects to have an enhanced scope or to be delivered sooner,\u201d the Boroondara spokesman said.\n\nThe council did not pitch for the pedestrian crossing on Barkers Road, the spokesman said, but it welcomed funding from any prospective candidate \u201cto help us deliver services and projects that improve the lives of our community\u201d.\n\nHamer and Ryan have taken swipes at each other over funding pledges on social media previously.\n\nWhen Dutton announced $400,000 for floodlights at the Malvern cricket ground, Ryan posted a long video on social media describing the pledge as Dutton \u201ccynically offering taxpayers money to try and buy votes\u201d.\n\nHamer defended the pledge in an Instagram video, saying it was \u201can example of how major parties can take action and actually deliver on issues rather than just talk about them\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not pork-barrelling. It\u2019s something we like to call policy,\u201d Hamer said.",

So there's a lot of meaning if we were to dissect each and every thing done here within the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAbraham Habte-Sellassie is a \u201ckesis\u201d or priest at the church.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbraham says there\u2019s keen interest in preserving Ge\u2019ez, and other traditions of the faith, for future generations in the bustling D.C. area, which is home to the largest Ethiopian diaspora community in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our tradition is ancient. It comes from apostolic times and we believe in holy tradition. We have the Bible, we also have the holy tradition, but the two are not separate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo reach young people and new converts, DSK Mariam offers services in Amharic and English.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also display translations in both languages on large TV screens during service.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there are other modern touches: at the end of the service, church members record a video of an elder chanting a liturgy passed on from his ancestors, with the footage posted on the church\u2019s YouTube channel to preserve it for future generations in hopes they maintain the tradition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These kids, if they learn the tradition, the language and also the faith of course, the religion. If they do that they can balance, you know, life here is very hectic, you know, and also geared toward material profit. But the tradition concentrates on, focuses on spiritual development.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe church was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1987.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt now has more than 1,500 registered members, and church leaders say more than 4,000 people attend services each week.\n\n\n\n\n\n21-year-old Kannazegelila Mezgebu is a senior at Morgan State University in Baltimore, and one of the congregation's members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Here it's full of Ethiopians and full of people that are very welcoming because that's how we Ethiopans are. But when I'm here in this church, that's really how it feels and it really feels like home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBeza Bililigne says symbolism is woven throughout their faith practice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we first enter into the church, as you know, we take off our shoes. The reason we wear our \"netela\" symbolises the same way when Christ was born, he was wrapped in cloth.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd keeping with tradition, after the priest reads the liturgy, the holy Gospel is walked throughout the congregation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The deacon will take the Gospel and he'll take it to every believer in the church and they'll kiss that one Gospel that was read to symbolize their kissing the true words of our Lord and our Saviour Jesus Christ.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAbraham Habte-Sellassie says DSK Mariam Church is part of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Churches, one of the oldest Christian faiths in Africa.\n\n\n\n",

Sometimes, there isn't even any information about who to vote for.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer prisoners have described to SBS News the barriers to voting while in jail and say the system does not appear to encourage voting and they are given little information on which to base their decision.\n\n\n\nNSW resident Damien Linnane, 39, says he tried to exercise his right to vote in 2016 but was unable to.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinnane tells SBS that in the lead up to election day, he was told about the process to enrol during a daily headcount, and filled out a form in the guard's office.\n\n\n\nNothing happened on election day. I was not called up to vote, nor was anyone else [that I saw].\n\n\"I asked the guards again and they said they had no idea about anything to do with the election. It was as if there was no election,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was only at the end of the afternoon when we got locked back in that I was sure I would not be voting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Linnane enquired about why he wasn't assisted to vote, the prison staff said there was \"a logistical issue\". He says he complained to the NSW Ombudsman when the agency was at the prison for a routine visit, but he never heard anything back.\n\n\n\nDamien Linnane says he was not able to vote in 2016. Source: Supplied / Michelle Cox The NSW Ombudsman told SBS News it does not comment on individual complaints after being asked about what happened with Linnane's complaint.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Corrective Services NSW spokesperson told SBS News correctional centres in the state only offer postal voting .\n\n\n\nExtremely low numbers of prisoners voted last election\n\nThe Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) told SBS News that just 274 eligible prisoners voted in the 2022 federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the AEC said the 2022 numbers were low due to COVID-19 restrictions, but it also doesn't have data for prior elections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The AEC was restricted in all mobile polling activities [in 2022], meaning we weren't delivering hospital voting and only doing minimal prison and aged care voting etc,\" they said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo data on prior federal elections is available, they said, as the system didn\u2019t allow for the tracking of numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, systems have been upgraded to ensure this data will be available for all federal elections (and referendums) from 2022 onwards. The upgrades reflect our commitment to improving and providing accurate information.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How to cast your vote in the federal election\n\nThere were 44,403 adults in prison on 30 June last year, although not all of these prisoners are eligible to vote, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commonwealth Electoral Act states that a person serving a sentence of three years or more is not entitled to vote, although there are calls for this to change.\n\n\n\n\n\nStates and territories also have separate rules for voting in state and local elections. The method by which prisoners vote can also vary between jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile NSW prisoners lodge postal votes, in Victoria, prisons are gazetted as early voting locations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAEC staff visit the prisons to facilitate voting for people in custody and staff, a spokesperson for the Victorian Department of Justice and Community Safety said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This involves bringing in manual voting booths into the prison in the week leading up to election day, with all prisons in Victoria participating.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australian federal election 2025 explained: Everything you need to know\n\nPush to change 'unjust' prisoner voting laws\n\nThis month in Tasmania, the state parliament tabled a recommendation to allow all people in prison to vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn line with the Commonwealth rules, the Tasmanian Electoral Act only allows persons serving sentences of less than three years to vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tasmanian Aboriginal Legal Service (TALS) has called for this recommendation to go further and start conversations about the federal limit as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Smith, CEO of TALS, says: \"With the federal election just weeks away, it is crucial that we consider who is being excluded from democratic participation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Decisions made at both state and federal levels \u2014 by political parties, ministers, and governments \u2014 deeply affect the lives of people in prison.\"\n\n\n\nEveryone deserves the right to have a say on decisions that impact them.\n\nSmith says the laws also disproportionately impact Aboriginal people, pointing out that they represent nearly 25 per cent of the prison population in Tasmania while making up just 5 per cent of the state's population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's unjust, and it's time these acts were amended,\" he says.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Party Time: The Players SBS News 10/04/2025 29:05 Play\n\nIn 2007, the Human Rights Law Centre assisted in successful legal action that allowed prisoners jailed for less than three years to vote in federal elections.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe centre supported Aunty Vickie Roach, an Aboriginal prisoner at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre in Victoria, to successfully challenge government legislation that applied a blanket ban on sentenced prisoners being able to vote as unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Mejia-Canales, a senior lawyer at the centre, said: \"We thought that that was not only just manifestly unfair, that's not how democracy works.\"\n\n\n\nPeople do not stop being citizens just because they are imprisoned.\n\nBut both Labor and the Coalition told SBS News they did not have plans to broaden eligibility to allow more prisoners to vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government is not considering any changes to voter eligibility,\" a Labor spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Coalition campaign spokesperson said: \"The Coalition has no plans to change laws in relation to prisoner voting.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The voters who could see more misinformation this election\n\n'Without information, you're very hesitant to vote'\n\nPrisoners who have managed to vote while in jail also face other barriers to making an informed choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nMelbourne resident Kelly Flanagan, 38, a Wiradjuri woman who voted while incarcerated during the Victorian state election in 2022, remembers being handed a piece of paper and told: \"Do something with it and if you don't, we'll fine you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's literally my voting experience in prison,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no internet in prison, and there are restrictions on which newspapers and television channels are allowed. Without access to much information, Flanagan was not confident about how to vote.\n\n\n\nKelly Flanagan says she was provided with very little information when she voted in the Victorian state election in 2022. Source: Supplied \"Without the information you're very hesitant to vote\", she said, \"I found there was no information on each party. And even when you ask officers to provide you with some, they won't,\" Flanagan says.\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation about who to vote for is a gap the AEC can't fill, as polling booths cannot provide information about parties or policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvan Ekin-Smyth, AEC national spokesperson, told SBS News: \"It's ultimately up to candidates and political parties who they communicate with and when.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLack of information is something that About Time, Australia's first national prison newspaper, has \"heard quite a lot\" about, according to senior reporter Denham Sadler.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The 24-year-old rule that lets politicians use your data however they want\n\nRosie Heselev, managing director of About Time agrees, saying: \"[prisoners] don't necessarily have access to party [policies], they don't have access to the internet like we do, don't have access to community events to ask a politician all these things that are so vital to our democracy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it is also difficult to confirm if resources such as newspapers are distributed properly because prisons can be \"so shuttered\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[It\u2019s] so hard for our small team to have oversight. What we do have is connections with corrections departments at each facility,\" she says.\n\n\n\nBarriers to voting can feel dehumanising\n\nFor incarcerated people, their voting experience can greatly impact their well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The experience of prisoners is our opinion doesn't matter. We're criminals, so we don't deserve information. We don't deserve to make an informed choice,\" Flanagan says.\n\n\n\nI know when I speak to other First Nations women, they're like, what's the point? They don't care about us, why should we bother?\n\nLinnane says he felt \"stung\" when he was released and received a fine for not voting in his mail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I actually tried and I was annoyed that I couldn't vote because I wanted to still feel connected to my community,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeselev and Sadler say it was important for the wider community to engage with the perspectives and stories of incarcerated people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When there's issues of crime and justice being pushed around any election cycle, it's really important for us as democratic citizens to know what our taxpayers' money is being spent on,\" Heselev says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think a first step for that is humanising this population.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey say this is especially important for marginalised populations such as First Nations people.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australian federal election 2025 explained: Everything you need to know\n\nSBS News asked authorities in NSW and Victoria about the arrangements in place to ensure prisoners can vote and what information is available to them.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Corrective Services NSW spokesperson said: \"Corrective Services NSW works with the NSW Electoral Commission and the Australian Electoral Commission to identify eligible inmates and facilitate enrolling to vote and postal voting in each correctional centre.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Victorian Department of Justice and Community Safety had a similar response, saying: \"Corrections Victoria works with the Australian Electoral Commission to help eligible people in custody participate in federal elections.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This includes providing them with information on upcoming elections and helping them enrol or update their existing enrolment details.\"\n\n\n\nLinnane and Flanagan still believe in voting\n\nLinnane still wants to encourage eligible prisoners to cast their vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is easy to feel like society's forgotten us. And voting might not make a difference, but not voting at all guarantees nothing will change.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Flanagan, this election is her first time voting since she was imprisoned for just under three years \u2014 something that makes her feel \"excited\" and \"like a valid person\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I feel more part of society\", she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I feel like my opinion now matters because I'm not a number.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though Flanagan is \"a little bit overwhelmed with how much information there is available\", she says she remains \"very passionate about making change and pushing for that process\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now I have the opportunity to have my voice heard.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australia is colloquially called the sunburnt country for a reason \u2014 there are reports of dangerous levels of UV in parts of the country on some days.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this doesn't mean Australians are immune to vitamin D deficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne in five adults in Australia suffer from a lack of the key vitamin, which is important for bone development and muscle and nerve function.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring winter, this rate increases to one in four Australians aged 18 and over, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data from 2022 to 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data, from the National Health Measures Survey, found vitamin D deficiency was highest for the 18\u201329 year age groups, while men were more likely to be deficient than women.\n\n\n\nWhy do so many Australians not get enough vitamin D?\n\nThe main source of the vitamin for Australians is sunlight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ultraviolet part of sunlight is energetic enough to convert a chemical in skin to vitamin D,\" Rebecca Mason, a bone and skin researcher and a professor at the University of Sydney, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That vitamin D is absorbed, [and] it's converted to other related chemicals.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What to eat to increase your vitamin D levels\n\nOne of the reasons is the use of sunscreen among people who face the risk of skin cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They really have to protect their skin, and that takes from the damaging effects of sunlight, and that takes priority,\" Mason explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut other factors can include a lack of exposure to sun for those with specific cultural clothing, being indoors all day for work, or having different skin tones.\n\n\n\nWhat are the consequences of vitamin D deficiency?\n\nSome experts believe that having less than the standard amount of vitamin D may come with serious medical consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout vitamin D, the body may face some issues absorbing calcium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You need the calcium and the phosphate that you eat to make healthy bones and healthy muscles,\" Mason said.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Massive research project finds new ways to treat Osteoarthritis SBS News 15/04/2025 10:14 Play\n\n\"If you don't have enough vitamin D, then your bones tend to be soft, this is with severe deficiency, and your muscles tend to be weak, particularly the shoulders and around the hips.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere may also be a link between vitamin D levels and other medical conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2024 study from Monash University found vitamin D deficiency was a risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis (MS) and several other autoimmune diseases.\n\n\n\nCan you test your vitamin D levels?\n\nAlthough mild vitamin D deficiency may not have any symptoms, more severe deficiencies usually come with tangible signs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You may fracture your bones more readily. You may find it difficult to get up from a sitting position,\" Mason explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you've got any bone problems like osteoporosis, you should check the vitamin D deficiency.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're worried about your vitamin D levels, there are rapid tests that could help you ascertain whether your body is in deficit.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tests are conducted using a small drop of blood from a finger prick, providing results about your vitamin D level within 15 minutes, but some experts believe such tests may not be sufficiently accurate.\n\n\n\n\"The results of the rapid tests vary from test to test, but there's a wide variation,\" Mason said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Your vitamin D [level] should be reasonably stable from day to day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says there could be \"some use\" to these kinds of tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you get a result that's not quite right and you're worried, then you should go and see your GP or health professional and get a proper blood test done.\"\n\n\n\nHow to receive vitamin D in winter?\n\nSunlight is the primary source for vitamin D, but even in cloudy winter days, there are still some solutions to increase its level.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way is exercising under the sun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can get a bit of sunshine if you exercise at the same time ... you've got to be exercising [and] roll your sleeves up,\" Mason suggests.\n\n\n\n\"A little bit of exercise, even indoors, can help you maintain your vitamin D levels.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Mason, other options include taking specific vitamin D supplements during the winter or consuming certain foods, such as dairy products and fish with skin, some dairy products and egg yolks.\n\n\n\nCan you have too much vitamin D?\n\nOn the other hand, too much vitamin D might not be healthy either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That certainly can be a problem. It's hard to get too much vitamin D unless you take far too many supplements,\" Mason warns.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "From joining an adults-only site to video gaming, commuter chats, DJing with influencers, and even a diss track \u2014 this year's federal election candidates are resorting to unconventional campaign methods to win over voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, political experts say it's unclear whether such methods will yield results.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the latest campaign tactic, Tasmanian Greens senator Nick McKim donned a hoodie, put on a headset and live-streamed himself playing one of the world's most popular video games in a bid to appeal to younger Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also dropped some lingo that not all Australians, especially older generations, would understand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is the corner of woke: we are dubbing (brushing off an interest), we are Griddying (dancing), we are fighting faschies (fascists),\" the 59-year-old senator said while playing Fortnite.\n\n\n\nSeeking to counter voter apathy and political disengagement, incumbent and aspiring candidates from both major and minor parties have found new ways to reach voters over the past month of campaigning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Once it would've been enough to basically be on the newspapers, the radio and television, particularly the late night bulletins,\" Terry Flew, professor of digital communication and culture at the University of Sydney, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, [there is] a whole range of social media outlets that are being reached out to ... These can be very influential.\"\n\n\n\n'One needs to be attention-seeking'\n\nOne of these social media platforms that politicians have used to reach a larger audience is adult site OnlyFans.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens MP Stephen Bates used the platform, widely known for charging fees for nude content, to post about the party's effort to make an HIV-related drug free in Australia .\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens leader Adam Bandt defended his party's campaign methods, after himself brandishing a giant toothbrush for a health-related policy announcement and campaigning as a DJ at a club.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We make no apologies for trying to get people's attention,\" he told the ABC's Insiders program.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Adam Bandt backs OnlyFans content posted by Greens MP for Brisbane\n\n\"If that involves going to a nightclub with a big toothbrush to advance our push to get dental into Medicare, then I am happy to do it, because a lot of people do not see politicians tackling the big issues.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens are not the only ones turning to these unconventional campaigning methods.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, independent candidate Nicolette Boele shared a social video of herself interviewing commuters on a train line in NSW, in a post seemingly inspired by the Egyptian-American comedian Kareem Rahma's popular New York Subway Takes series.\n\n\n\nAccording to Flew, about a third of the electorate votes for someone other than the major parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinor parties or candidates \"need to be attention-seeking\" because they don't have access to traditional media like the major parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All of these minor groups and independents are looking for ways to get cut through when the major parties have the more traditional model of the leaders on the bus or the plane, and journalists follow them around.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How to make your vote count in Australia's preferential voting system\n\n'An evolution of changes'\n\nHowever, the Labor Party and the Coalition have also not limited their campaigns to traditional methods.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the early days of the election campaign, the Liberal Party released a hip-hop 'diss track' titled Leaving Labor.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has used social media influencers in their election campaign, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese appearing on media figure Abbie Chatfield's podcast .\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton has also appeared on a podcast with the former Olympic diver and social media personality Sam Fricker.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlew said that by using these campaign tactics, parties are \"looking for the disengaged\" and trying to meet them on the platforms that they're on, such as TikTok or other social media platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think generally also to get cut through in this environment probably requires something unconventional,\" Flew said.\n\n\n\n\"It's more generally the population that has low, low investment in everyday politics.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Triton Digital 2024 Australian Podcast Report, 48 per cent of podcast listeners in Australia are 18 to 34 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's been an evolution of changes going on for some time, and it's often talked about which party won the social media campaign,\" Flew explained.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Influencers respond after revelations Labor paid for federal budget travel for some\n\n\"I think all of the parties consider reaching out to influencers ... to be an important part of their armoury.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is also just the need to get attention where there's just so much, so much noise in the atmosphere.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut just how effective turning to podcasts, rap, gaming, and OnlyFans has been is not clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not necessarily the case that going for unconventional methods delivers results.

So if Labor, you know, running the scare campaign when it's actually harder and more expensive to see a doctor in this country under the Labor party.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n[---]\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Greens leader Adam Bandt says he has written to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet asking it to prepare a 'green book' to help prepare for a hung parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of each election, public servants prepare red books, for a potential Labor government, and blue books, for a potential coalition government.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe books detail the parties respective policies and how they could be implemented.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Adam Bandt says the likelihood of a minority government is higher this election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got less than a third of the country voting for the government, a bit more than a third of the country voting for the opposition, and about a third of the country voting for someone else. It's time for the public servants to prepare not only a red book and a blue book, but a green book as well, so that ideas like making sure that renters and first home buyers get a chance getting dental into Medicare, making childcare free are all ready to go when there's a minority government after this election.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n[---]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Easter weekend drowning toll has climbed to six after a fisherman dies while a 14-year-old boy remains in a stable condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmergency crews were called to Wattamolla in Sydney's south on Sunday morning after reports of two people being dragged into the ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest drowning comes after a spate of deaths, including two fisherman on the New South Wales south coast and another in Sydney's north.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales Deputy Premier Prue Car says it's crucial that people follow the advice of lifesavers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really important to make sure that the people of New South Wales understand that while the weather is beautiful and yes, you want to get down to the beach with your kids during the break and the school holidays, please take the advice at all times of surf life saving. Make sure you stay away from dangerous swells you are putting your life in danger as well as those that we will have to send to save you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n[---]\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian pilgrims from around the world have gathered in east Jerusalem to celebrate the Holy Fire ceremony.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deeply symbolic Easter ritual dates back more than 1,200 years and usually draws thousands of worshippers to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, where Christians believe Jesus was laid to rest.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite its significance, Israel imposed severe restrictions that prevented many Palestinian Christians from participating.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael announced it would only permit access to 6000 Christians from the West Bank, despite around 50,000 living there.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal worshipper George Hananiya says it is very difficult to celebrate while Palestinians are still being killed every day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you look at the Arab Palestinian people's ID cards, there is no place where it says Muslim or Christian, we are one people, one blood. Today, Gaza, Bethlehem, Turkarm and Jenin are all afflicted Palestinian towns. How is one Palestinian to be happy while his brother is bleeding. Today and with the bloodshed of Palestinians, each one that has lost has a family member, a mother, a father, a child, a whole family that is mourning him.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n[---]\n\n\n\n\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says if Russia is ready to engage in a full and unconditional truce, Ukraine will do the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe comments came after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a surprise Easter truce set to last until midnight Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut just hours after the truce was set to come into effect, air raid sirens sounded in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and Ukraine's military says Russian attacks continued.\n\n\n\n\n\nVolodomyr Zelenskyy, in a post on social media, made a proposal to extend a ceasefire beyond April 20 and says 30 days could give peace a chance.\n\n\n\n\n\nKyiv resident Natalia Yurchynko says she doesn't trust Mr Putin to keep to his word.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I personally do not believe this because it is not the first time and rules were broken before. That is why I think it will not be the way he promised, there will be violations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n[---]\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Golf now ...\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's Minjee Lee has rallied after a mid-round meltdown to stay in the mix for a drought-breaking LPGA Tour triumph at the L-A Championship.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour back-nine birdies helped the two-time major champion to a third-round two-under-par 70 to leave her three strokes behind the tournament's leading trio.\n\n\n\n\n\nLee is at 14 under alongside lurking world Number 1 Nelly Korda and is well within striking distance of Japan's Akie Iwai, in-form American Lauren Coughlin and rising Swede Ingrid Lindblad.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Greens leader Adam Bandt has signalled he wants discussions on changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax to be a priority in the next parliament, asking Treasury to prepare a 'green book' of policy information for the Greens.\n\n\n\n\n\nNegotiating with the crossbench would be a necessity if the election results in a minority government , which polls indicate is a possibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens are facing a fight to retain the three lower house Queensland seats they won in 2022; only Bandt's electorate of Melbourne, which he has occupied since 2010, is held by a safe margin.\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment departments are required to prepare a 'red book' and a 'blue book' of briefings for the Labor and Liberal parties respectively, which they only receive if they win the next election.\n\n\n\nConfident of a minority government, Bandt said the public service should \"get cracking\" on a green book, with updated and expanded modelling on negative gearing and capital gains tax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Experts have panned the major parties' housing policies as a 'dumpster fire' that will push up house prices even further, and with millions of people realising we can't keep voting for the same two parties and expecting a different result,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We now have a chance for real reform that will level the playing field for first home buyers.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the ABC's Insiders program, Bandt said reforms to improve the country were coming from the crossbench.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the late 1990s, John Howard's capital gains tax discount really lit a fire under the housing market,\" Bandt said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got to diffuse this time bomb in a way that is fair.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Housing: Different plans to ease the crisis, but will any of them work? SBS News 16/04/2025 11:13 Play\n\nWhat is the Greens' housing policy?\n\nAs well as scrapping negative gearing discounts, the Greens policy would abolish the existing capital gains tax concession for more than one property.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe capital gains tax is applied when selling an asset like a house after owning it for at least 12 months \u2014 sellers can claim a 50 per cent tax discount on any profit made from the sale of assets, which include stocks, bonds, jewellery and real estate.\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative gearing is the ability of an investor to offset any income from an investment against any losses or costs involved in maintaining it \u2014 meaning they could pay less income tax.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Parliamentary Budget Office analysis in June last year revealed that the tax revenue foregone as a result of these two concessions had risen from $6.7 billion in the 2014-15 financial year to $10.9 billion in the 2023-24 financial year. That figure is expected to be $12.3 billion in 2024-25.\n\n\n\nCoalition housing spokesperson Michael Sukkar defended negative gearing as \"a standard feature of our tax system\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Where you tax housing more, you get fewer homes and you get higher rents,\" Sukkar said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That will be terrible for renters and terrible for first home buyers, too, who, in the end, will have fewer homes to choose from.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing policy has dominated the election campaign, with both Labor and the Coalition promising to help Australians get on the property ladder through access to new builds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a leader's debate this week, Opposition leader Peter Dutton accused Anthony Albanese of having \"a problem with the truth\" when the prime minister denied that the government had requested Treasury modelling on negative gearing and capital gains tax last year, despite comments from the Treasurer last year appearing to confirm the request.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "But Leto says much bolder reforms are needed to convince voters under 45 years that major parties are \u201cfully invested\u201d in dealing with the challenges they face. \u201cBoomers and Gen X voters grew up with housing that was affordable, benefited from reforms like Medicare, superannuation and a suite of government policies that allowed them to raise families, retire with good incomes and comfortably contribute to the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout serious action, the picture isn\u2019t as pretty for younger generations.\u201d Shannon Said, a 35-year-old mental health clinician from Mount Druitt, says young people in western Sydney haven\u2019t benefited meaningfully from government investments and feel a sense of \u201cfutility\u201d about politics. Millennial voter Shannon Said predicts many young people in Western Sydney will vote for Greens and independents. Credit: Thomas Wielecki \u201cHow often have these parties actually met with young people and engaged with them meaningfully, not just for a few photos and a few news appearances?\u201d he says. \u201cAre you coming down to places where youth are and actually engaging with what they\u2019re saying? I don\u2019t see that.\u201d\n\nSaid is planning to vote for an independent. \u201cI think we\u2019re probably going to see a lot of voting for the Greens and independents because they seem to be more in tune with what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says. Opinion polls show Labor and the Coalition are struggling to win over younger voters; a Resolve Political Monitor (RPM) survey published earlier this month showed only 56 per cent of those aged 18-35 backed one of the two majors. That compares with 74 per cent support for the Coalition and Labor among those aged over 55. Jim Reed, who conducts the Resolve Political Monitor published by this masthead, says young voters have been hit hard by cost-of-living pressures and a lack of affordable housing.\n\n\u201cYounger people tend to earn less when they\u2019re starting out, and rental prices have hampered their ability to crack property ownership too,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder this group is voting for change via minor parties and independents, and staying there for longer than they used to. They don\u2019t see solutions coming from the major parties.\u201d Lukas Galanto is another young voter unconvinced by what major parties are offering. \u201cI see myself voting more independent \u2026 it just doesn\u2019t really feel like the bigger parties have actual interest in the local communities,\u201d says the 21-year-old who rents in Castle Hill. Much of the information Galanto receives about the election comes via social media.\n\nYoung voters Lukas Galanto and Mara Board Credit: Thomas Wielecki \u201cEvery now and then I do see [politicians on my social media], but it\u2019s never about what they\u2019re planning to do, it\u2019s always what the other party isn\u2019t doing,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like they\u2019re fighting instead of actually telling you kind of the plans they have for you.\u201d His friend Mara Board, a 21-year-old university student, feels politicians are not \u201cdoing much for people our age; they don\u2019t really talk to us.\u201d Board, who lives as St Mary\u2019s, is especially pessimistic about her homeownership prospects. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to afford Sydney when it is that time to get a job and move out,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Australian Election Study (AES), which has surveyed voters after each election since the mid-1980s, shows the behaviour of Millennial and Gen Z voters differs from previous generations. Only about one in four voters under the age of 40 reported voting for the Coalition at the 2022 federal election. \u201cAt no time in the 35-year history of the AES have we observed such a low level of support for either major party in so large a segment of the electorate,\u201d the study said. The share of under-40s voting for the ALP in 2022 was 38 per cent, unchanged from 2019. \u201cThe evidence shows that political partisanship among younger generations is lower than it has been in the past for both Labor and Liberal,\u201d says Griffith University\u2019s Dr Sarah Cameron, a chief investigator on the AES. \u201cIt\u2019s higher, however, for the Greens.\u201d\n\nThe latest electoral roll data published by the Australian Electoral Commission shows the seat of Greenway in Sydney\u2019s north-western suburbs has the city\u2019s highest share of Millennial and Gen Z voters at 54 per cent followed by the neighbouring electorate of Chifley (53 per cent). Loading The inner-city electorate of Sydney is the only seat outside the western suburbs where Millennials and Gen Z are the majority of voters (52 per cent). Major differences in age profiles are emerging across Australian electorates as the population ages. The seat of Greenway has only 10,315 voters over the age of 70 while in Mackellar there are over 26,592 voters in that age group, the latest election roll data shows. The share of older voters is much higher in many regional electorates. In the north coast NSW seat of Lynne there are 36,580 voters aged over 70 and in the marginal south coast electorate of Gilmore there are 34,593 voters in that age group.",

        "text": "Loading My Marriage Sabbatical: A Memoir of Solo Travel and Lasting Love is a record of Fisher\u2019s exploration of travel and personal growth, visiting Costa Rica, Guatemala, Ecuador, Cuba, Bali, Java and Colombia. It\u2019s some journey, full of risk and volunteer work. Fisher, who is a marriage counsellor, took Charley along on a few trips, and there were other, regular reunions in Arizona. But Fisher also told Charley that he could see other women in her absence. That changed when Charley announced that he\u2019d formed an emotional attachment to another woman and said he would like to see her. Surprise: Fisher realised that she wasn\u2019t as open to open marriage as she had believed. Her therapist pronounced: \u201cThis is the stupidest plan I\u2019ve heard about in a long time!\u201d So ended the sexual experiment, but not Fisher\u2019s leave-taking for solo travel or her irritation with her husband when they were together. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten sick of each other,\u201d Fisher informed Charley before setting off on the final leg of her sabbatical. \u201cNo,\u201d he replied. \u201cI think we\u2019ve gotten lonely for each other.\u201d Eventually, Fisher sees the value of both her flawed relationship and her time away from it. \u201cWhat neither Charley nor I realised when we agreed to be apart for a year,\u201d she concludes, \u201cwas that we were in the process of reconfiguring our marriage. We were experimenting with a different version of matrimony, one that was flexible and spacious enough to support independent dreams as well as those we shared.\u201d\n\nThe unnamed narrator of Miranda July\u2019s wildly popular \u2013 and divisive \u2013 novel All Fours makes Fisher\u2019s real-life marital pause seem positively Amish. July\u2019s heroine takes a road-trip detour from her marriage and motherhood to plumb her sexuality, identity and appetite for interior decorating. Her plan is to drive across the country. Instead, she spends $20,000 refashioning a motel room a few miles from her Los Angeles home while panting after incongruous lust objects. Loading Divorce, in the narrator\u2019s view, is for ordinary folk. \u201cRumours began to swirl around Harris and me \u2013 most people thought we were getting divorced,\u201d July writes. \u201cThis made me irate. \u2018Divorce only reinforces the supremacy of marriage!\u2019 \u201d True, but only if you decide to wed in the first place. The narrator is too rarefied to be in something as pedestrian as a conventionally constructed marriage. By the novel\u2019s end, she has a girlfriend, her husband has a girlfriend, and whatever remains of their union is quite different but better, with less suffering.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting formality that had been there since day two had simply lifted like a depression, a cloud of steam, and what remained was a pair of old kids who knew each other very well,\u201d July writes. Readers tend to adore All Fours or wish to fling it against a wall. July\u2019s ambition is impressive and her plot often inventive, but this is one self-absorbed, careless and tiresome heroine, whose bio shares much with the author\u2019s. Still, July\u2019s book, a finalist for a National Book Award and the Women\u2019s Prize for Fiction, is a bestseller that continues to spark conversation on the eve of its paperback publication. People (that would be women) want to talk about what\u2019s wrong with marriage and share, sometimes to the point of TMI, about creative ways to fix it. See also last year\u2019s More: A Memoir of Open Marriage, by Molly Roden Winter, a married non-monogamous Brooklyn mom, and Ada Calhoun\u2019s recent novel, Crush, in which the protagonist\u2019s husband (inspired by Jessica Fern\u2019s 2020 book, Polysecure) suggests the couple flirt with other people while keeping those rings on their fingers. Jessica Stanley\u2019s forthcoming novel, Consider Yourself Kissed, doesn\u2019t waste any time catching this zeitgeist. Her protagonist, Australian Coralie, announces her intention to take a break from a 10-year relationship with Englishman Adam in the second paragraph. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t love, she was half a person. But if she did love, she\u2019d never be whole,\u201d Stanley writes. \u201cMother, writer, worker, sister, friend, citizen, daughter, (sort of) wife. If she could be one, perhaps she could manage. Trying to be all, she found that she was none.\u201d The couple live together, have children together, but never wed. It only feels like they have. So this is more of a relationship sabbatical. As domesticity starts to crush her, Coralie craves not a room of one\u2019s own but, this being London, a flat.",

        "text": "Kooyong MP Monique Ryan has suggested funding pledges from her Liberal rival Amelia Hamer for local sports grounds and potholes is \u201ca form of corruption\u201d, after the Liberal Party announced $7.5 million to reseal roads in the electorate over the weekend.\n\nA running total compiled by The Age of Liberal Party promises for the coveted seat shows more than $14 million has now been offered to voters in the area if they back a federal Liberal government. The pledges range from playgrounds for kindergartens to lighting at multiple sports fields.\n\nAmelia Hamer, the Liberal candidate for Kooyong, with young footballers at Glenferrie Oval this month. Credit: Joe Armao\n\nThe latest promise came on Saturday, where Hamer was joined by Liberal state MPs to announce \u201cresurfacing and safety upgrades\u201d to three stretches of state-managed arterials roads in Kooyong: Glenferrie Road (between Cotham and Wattletree roads), Cotham/Whitehorse Road (between Kew Junction and Union Road) and Balwyn Road (between Doncaster and Canterbury roads).\n\nThe announcement also includes the installation of a pedestrian crossing on Barkers Road in Kew (a council road) at the intersection of Haines Street and Edgevale Road.\n\n\u201cToo often I hear about the fact that a well-used road has more potholes each year, but no work has been done to fix them. This isn\u2019t good enough and we can do better,\u201d Hamer said in the announcement.\n\nJess Wilson, John Pesutto and Michael O\u2019Brien \u2013 the state Liberal MPs for Kew, Hawthorn and Malvern, respectively \u2013 appeared in Hamer\u2019s social media post announcing the funding \u2013 as did the sole remaining Liberal councillor at Boroondara Council, Felicity Sinfield.\n\nIn the media release for the announcement, the state MPs accused the Allan government of ignoring requests for upgrades and suggested Ryan had no leverage to get funding for community projects.\n\n\u201cThe state government has failed to listen, and the federal member isn\u2019t listened to \u2013 but Amelia Hamer will actually deliver,\u201d Pesutto said.\n\nLoading\n\nWhen asked under what criteria the roads were chosen, a Liberal campaign spokeswoman said: \u201cRoads were selected based on community feedback and the failure of both the Albanese and Allan Labor governments to invest in road upgrades across Melbourne and regional Victoria.\n\n\u201cOur Victorian infrastructure commitments will be delivered in partnership with state and local governments.\u201d\n\nA Victorian government spokeswoman acknowledged the state had received a petition for the pedestrian crossing from Wilson, but had not received any formal requests from local MPs or councils to repair the three stretches of state roads named in the funding pledge.\n\nRyan described the Liberals\u2019 funding announcements in her electorate as pork-barrelling.\n\n\u201cRolling out pre-election promises of money for infrastructure projects is a tired major party trope. It didn\u2019t work for Josh Frydenberg in 2022,\u201d she said on Sunday, referencing the infamous commuter car parks scandal.\n\nIn March 2022, Frydenberg, then the Kooyong MP and then federal treasurer, announced that four commuter car parks would no longer go ahead in Kooyong, following community consultation, three years after they were promised during the 2019 election campaign. The Australian National Audit Office had criticised the former Coalition government\u2019s allocation of money from the fund for favouring Liberal seats.\n\n\u201cMore than 80 per cent of Australians see pork-barrelling as a form of corruption: I think that figure would be higher in Kooyong,\u201d Ryan said on Sunday in response to Hamer\u2019s full list of pledges.\n\nRyan also claimed several of the projects the Liberal Party had announced funding for were already funded or had not been raised with the two council areas they fall within, although her office would not reveal which projects she was referring to.\n\n\u201cThe Kooyong community wants funding for sporting grounds and community infrastructure projects to be allocated transparently and fairly,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working collaboratively with Boroondara and Stonnington councils to find support for the projects they\u2019ve identified as high priority, on the basis of their detailed, evidence-based assessments.\u201d\n\nAll of Hamer\u2019s commitments for the Stonnington council area were requests made in the council\u2019s official election advocacy document. A spokesman for Boroondara council said all four sport projects announced by Hamer in the municipality were all priority projects that the council already planned to deliver regardless of the outcome of the federal election.\n\n\u201c[But] where aligned with existing Council priorities, co-contributions from other levels of government allows projects to have an enhanced scope or to be delivered sooner,\u201d the Boroondara spokesman said.\n\nThe council did not pitch for the pedestrian crossing on Barkers Road, the spokesman said, but it welcomed funding from any prospective candidate \u201cto help us deliver services and projects that improve the lives of our community\u201d.\n\nHamer and Ryan have taken swipes at each other over funding pledges on social media previously.\n\nWhen Dutton announced $400,000 for floodlights at the Malvern cricket ground, Ryan posted a long video on social media describing the pledge as Dutton \u201ccynically offering taxpayers money to try and buy votes\u201d.\n\nHamer defended the pledge in an Instagram video, saying it was \u201can example of how major parties can take action and actually deliver on issues rather than just talk about them\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not pork-barrelling. It\u2019s something we like to call policy,\u201d Hamer said.",
