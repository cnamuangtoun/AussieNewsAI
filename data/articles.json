Few can see the value in extending post-season hope to the 10th-best team in an 18-team competition, and most can see through the confected drama it will apparently provide.\n\nThe Hawks and Swans played in Opening Round in 2025. (Getty Images: Michael Willson)\n\nWildcard Round is Dillon's latest calendar-extending innovation, following the equally maligned \"Opening Round\", which sees the season stutter into life with a handful of games on the east coast, at the small cost of throwing off the balance of the fixture entirely.\n\nThis year, if reports are to be believed, Opening Round will feature a game between St Kilda and Collingwood at the MCG, brought about because the Magpies told the league they did not want to travel for their first game again this season.\n\nIn that case, innovation has created a spiral of unintended consequences and issues to resolve \u2014 can any club simply tell the AFL when and where it feels like travelling now? How much of an advantage is two byes in a season?\n\nWildcard Round is another example of that flawed principle, a problematic solution to another problem the AFL created.\n\nThe pre-finals bye has been in place for nearly a decade now, and has become begrudgingly accepted by fans as part of the calendar.\n\nBut for a league determined to own 52 weeks and 365 days of the year, that black hole in the schedule is now unacceptable. And so a fifth week of finals has been created.\n\nAll of which takes us back to the main question at hand \u2014 why is any of this happening?\n\nDillon told the media on Monday he wanted \"more games of consequence\" each season, but you could safely trim that answer in half. Simply \"more games\" is the objective here.\n\nMore games means more tickets sold, more eyeballs on TVs, and a greater package to offer the broadcasters. More money, effectively.\n\nThe Lions claimed their second straight premiership in 2025. (Getty Images: Darrian Traynor)\n\nNext season, we will have State of Origin in February before Opening Round begins in early March. There will then be men's footy every week until the end of September, before we get straight into the all-consuming trade period and the November draft.\n\nIf 2026 mirrors the years before, the AFLW season will continue through those spring months. That time slot seems to be actively harming the success of that league, but the AFL's pursuit of omnipresence is currently outweighing a desire to make the women's competition all it could be.\n\nWith that in mind, any publicity is good publicity for the AFL. With summer creeping in and little more than a week out from an Ashes series, the AFL has still managed to command the sporting public and media's attention \u2014 an irony not lost during the compiling of the very words you are currently reading.\n\nIt is a slam dunk for AFL House, then. Debate and rancour in November 2025 and extra footy in September 2026 and beyond \u2014 everybody wins.\n\nThat the fans are unsettled by yet more innovation for innovation's sake is of little consequence.\n\nAfter all, they will all still turn up to watch 12th play 15th in round 22 as the heated season-long race for that coveted 10th spot captures the national imagination. Footy fans, it turns out, will still love footy no matter how bent out of shape it gets.\n\nThe sense that devotion is being exploited is palpable, though, and it would not be wise to test it too rigorously. Fans will forgive anything for the love of the game, up until the point they no longer recognise it.",

        "text": "Donald Trump has become the first sitting US president in nearly half a century to attend a regular-season NFL game, appearing at the Washington Commanders' contest against the Detroit Lions.\n\nThere were loud boos from some spectators in the stands on Sunday when Mr Trump was shown on the video board late in the first half \u2014 standing in a suite with House Speaker Mike Johnson \u2014 and again when the president was introduced by the stadium announcer at half-time.\n\nThe jeering continued while Mr Trump read an oath for members of the military to recite as part of an on-field enlistment ceremony during the break in the game.\n\n\"I'm a little bit late,\" Mr Trump told reporters earlier when he got off Air Force One after landing at Joint Base Andrews, following a flyover of Northwest Stadium during the game.\n\nHe then got in his armoured car for the drive to the arena.\n\n\"We're gonna have a good game. Things are going along very well. The country's doing well. The Democrats have to open it up,\" he said \u2014 a reference to the government shutdown.\n\nIn the first quarter, before the president arrived, Lions receiver Amon-Ra St Brown celebrated a touchdown catch by pointing into the stands and moving his arms a la the \"Trump dance\" that several athletes began doing last year.\n\nDuring the third quarter, Mr Trump joined Fox broadcasters Kenny Albert and Jonathan Vilma for about eight minutes of lighthearted chat. Albert opened by asking Mr Trump about his time playing high school football at New York Military Academy.\n\n\"I played tight end, but it was not quite football like this. It was a little bit easier. It wasn't so tough,\" Mr Trump said.\n\nOnly two other times did a president go to an NFL game during the regular season while in office, according to the league: Richard Nixon in 1969 and Jimmy Carter in 1978.\n\nMr Trump became the first president to attend a Super Bowl while residing in the White House when he watched the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 in February.\n\nAccording to a report by ESPN on Saturday, an intermediary for the White House told the Commanders' ownership group that Mr Trump wanted the club's new stadium \u2014 part of a nearly $US4 billion ($6 billion) project in the nation's capital at the site of what was known as RFK Stadium \u2014 to bear his name.\n\nMr Trump has, from the 80s onwards, sought to become an owner of an NFL team, though he has never succeeded.\n\nHe did, however, become the team owner of the New Jersey Generals in the rival United States Football League (USFL), and led the league in a lawsuit against the NFL to attempt to force a merger, which the USFL nominally won before disbanding soon after.\n\nDonald Trump received a mixed reaction from the Washington crowd. (AP Photo: Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nIn Sunday's TV appearance, Mr Trump spoke about the team's plans to return to Washington.\n\n\"They're going to build a beautiful stadium. That's what I'm involved in, we're getting all the approvals and everything else,\" he said.\n\n\"And you have a wonderful owner, Josh [Harris] and his group, and you're going to see some very good things.\"\n\nSunday's visit was the latest in a series of high-profile appearances at sporting events by Mr Trump, including at golf's Ryder Cup, auto racing's Daytona 500 and tennis's US Open.\n\n\"I just love it. It's a microcosm of life,\" Mr Trump said about sports during Sunday's broadcast.\n\n\"It's sort of like life \u2014 the good, the bad and the ugly.\"\n\nStream End Game with Tony Armstrong on ABC iview Tony Armstrong tackles Australia's overdue reckoning with racism in sport with the help of some of its biggest sports stars.\n\nBefore the game, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth chatted with Mr Harris \u2014 the leader of the group that purchased the Commanders from Daniel Snyder for about $US6 billion in 2023 \u2014 and took part in an on-field ceremony with members of the military.\n\nMr Hegseth was among those watching the game with Mr Trump, along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Republican senator Steve Daines of Montana.\n\nThere was friction between Mr Trump and the NFL during his first presidential term, when he objected to players kneeling during the national anthem to protest social or racial injustice. That movement began in 2016 with then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.\n\nVia social media and other public comments, Mr Trump insisted that players should stand for the national anthem and called on team owners to fire anyone taking a knee.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

(ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\nWhile his primary success came from talkback radio, Laws lent his iconic voice to radio and TV commercials, and at times appeared on the small screen as a presenter, interviewer and talk-show panellist.\n\nHe also released several singles as a country music singer and was a published poet.\n\nLaws dominates airwaves one last time\n\nOn Monday morning, both AM and FM radio stations dedicated air-time to broadcast snippets of his catalogue across his 71-year legacy.\n\n2SM, the network which the veteran broadcaster retired from just over a year ago after a 13-year stint, aired segments from Laws's popular morning show, including a chat with regular listener Dale, who was known for calling in to speak with the host every Thursday.\n\nOn 2GB host Ben Fordham opened his show with a lengthy tribute to Laws, declaring to listeners that \"radio has lost its king\".\n\nBen Fordham paid tribute to Laws as a \"master communicator\". (AAP: Joel Carrett)\n\nHe revealed the pair saw each other just 10 days ago, having met Laws at his home because he was \"too stubborn\" to cancel lunch due to his health.\n\n\"He was strong and stubborn and silly right to the very end,\" Fordham said.\n\n\"John Laws was a master communicator, he could have important conversations with politicians but he also connected with the truckies and the taxi drivers ... everyone felt like they knew Lawsy.\"\n\nTalkback marks 'end of an era'\n\n2GB presenter Mark Levy said it was a sad day. (Supplied: 2GB)\n\nFellow 2GB host Mark Levy paid tribute to both Laws and Labor statesman Graham Richardson, who died only the day before aged 76.\n\n\"It's a sad and sombre day,\" he said.\n\n\"They both left an indelible mark on this country and the outpouring of grief emphasises the respect and admiration they both built making and influencing the decisions that helped shape Australia today.\n\n\" The passing of these two giants marks the end of the era, a time when power in Australia was often not just wielded in parliament, but also through the sheer force of personality and the persuasive influence of the microphone. \"\n\nHe described Laws's show of national conversation and a daily public forum for politics.\n\n\"The public felt their concerns were not only heard but amplified [when] speaking to Lawsy,\" Levy said.\n\nBrendan Jones from WFSM recounted his relationship with Laws.\n\n\"I wasn't sure what he made of me,\" Jones said.\n\n\"I don't think we were great mates, but we did hang out.\"\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nHe said Laws had \"the theatre of the mind\", which had inspired him early on his career.\n\n\"When I started in radio in 1990, we used to have to play his show, we used to have to record his show and replay it to WA because we were three hours behind,\" he said.\n\n\"That's when I really fell in love with broadcasting.\"\n\nKISS FM host Kyle Sandilands led tributes shortly after news of Laws's death emerged on Sunday night.\n\nSandliands was known for trading barbs with Laws over the years, but said he was devastated to lose \"a mentor and mate\".\n\nState funeral a possibility\n\nNSW Premier Chris Minns said he was open to holding a state funeral for the radio veteran.\n\nThe premier told Channel 9 he would discuss with Laws's family the best way to honour him.\n\n\"We do everything we can to acknowledge his legacy and reputation for Australia and broadcasting, so if they would like to do it, we'd love to offer it.\"",

        "text": "The Reserve Bank has expressed concern the Australian economy may be trapped in the slow lane of economic growth, indefinitely.\n\nThis would suppress wage growth and household income for millions of Australians for decades.\n\nThe silver lining is that the central bank believes there is still time for the economy to break free, find clear air and grow faster than its long-term average.\n\n\"Could Australia find itself trapped on the economic rail like one of the riders in last week's Cup \u2014 boxed in by its own capacity constraints?\", deputy governor of the Reserve Bank Andrew Hauser asked a Sydney gathering of investment bankers and economists today.\n\n\"Or will it find ways to break free, through higher productivity and more investment in new capacity?\n\n\"If it does, we could be off to the races,\" he said.\n\nIn simple terms, Mr Hauser says if Australia can boost productivity, the capacity of the economy will expand, and it will be able to tolerate more demand without higher inflation.\n\nInflation tame, but there's a problem\n\nOfficial third-quarter inflation figures show some price hikes came roaring back in the economy.\n\nFingers were pointing at the cost of energy.\n\nIt had economists convinced the RBA would leave interest rates on hold at its November meeting.\n\nThe RBA, though, today has reiterated that it is not concerned about the medium-term inflation outlook.\n\n\"The further decline in inflation through the end of 2024 and into 2025 gave us greater confidence that it would return sustainably to target over the medium term,\" Mr Hauser said.\n\nThe problem is that unless productivity picks up, and the RBA inflation models assume it will, increased demand in the economy will put upward pressure on inflation.\n\nThat is because, as Mr Hauser puts it, the economy as it stands is operating at or close to full capacity.\n\n\"Most recoveries in GDP growth over the past 40 years typically start with some margin of spare capacity \u2014 a negative 'output gap' \u2014 as the preceding slowdown pushes the level of aggregate demand below estimates of the potential output of the economy,\" he said.\n\nHe is making the simple point that an economic growth phase requires some degree of spare capacity.\n\n\"As the economy recovers, that buffer typically provides room for a period of above-trend growth in activity and employment, as demand rises back towards potential output, without generating excessive inflationary pressures,\" Mr Hauser said.\n\nRight now, the Australian economy does not appear to have that, so if economic growth accelerates, it will be joined by higher inflation.\n\nMatter of urgency\n\nWorse still, it is possible, the Reserve Bank says, the Australian economy is currently operating above capacity, at the start of a hoped-for economic growth phase.\n\n\"This time looks different,\" Mr Hauser said.\n\n\"Our central estimate suggests that demand was slightly above potential output at the time GDP growth started to pick up last year \u2014 the tightest economic backdrop to a recovery since at least the early 1980s.\"\n\nMr Hauser believes the problem stems from the \"cumulative effect of rapid demand growth in 2021-2022, the deliberately cautious monetary policy strategy of more recent years, and \u2014 importantly \u2014 weak growth in supply\".\n\nCritical point for economy\n\nIt is possible, Mr Hauser points out, that \"there's more capacity today than the estimates suggest\".\n\nIn this world, \"further policy easing may be necessary at some horizon\", which would no doubt be welcomed by millions of mortgage borrowers.\n\nBut the deputy governor's second scenario is centred on a fear \"that the economy may find itself boxed in by its own capacity constraints, like a racehorse trapped against the course fence, unable to surge forward\".\n\n\"On that view, there may be little scope for demand growth to rise further without adding to inflationary pressures, and hence there may be little room for further policy easing.\"\n\nIn this environment, millions of households find it difficult to get ahead because any expansion of the economy results in higher inflation.\n\nThe Reserve Bank, however, wants to remind policy makers that Australia has what it takes to be a world-leading advanced economy, \"with extraordinary minerals resources, old and new\".\n\nMr Hauser described world-class universities and human capital, Australia enjoying a plumb geographical position in the Asia Pacific, huge domestic savings pool, the second largest median wealth per capita in the world, a strong banking system, proven political and economic institutions, and a long track record of welcoming foreign capital and labour.\n\n\"If that doesn't scream 'investment potential', I don't know what does,\" he said.\n\n\"Seize that opportunity, and we really could be off to the races.\"\n\nHousing versus productivity\n\nAustralia's extraordinary median wealth per capita, strong banking system, along with foreign capital and labour has also, according to analysts, assisted in pushing property prices to record highs.\n\nAnd economists say that, in turn, has sucked investment away from areas of the economy with more productive potential than the housing market.\n\n\"Yes, to a certain extent,\" RSM Australia economist Devika Shivadekar said.\n\n\"High demand for property means there's always a need for labour.\n\n\"Being a comparatively low-skilled sector, most of the younger talent naturally gravitates towards building jobs, easier to get working straight from high school, rather than developing technical skills that can help prop up other industries.\"\n\nOther economists say record property prices have stifled Australia's economic capacity more indirectly.\n\n\"The poor productivity growth in the housing sector has also hurt [Australia's] ability to supply,\" AMP's deputy chief economist Diana Mousina said.\n\n\"The two are so interconnected.\n\n\"I [also] think our tax system and our migration system has created the housing problem that we are in.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Betashares chief economist David Bassanese says incentives for share investors also deserve some of the blame for Australia's weak productivity.\n\n\"I would say the love affair with dividends and franking instead perhaps has [hurt productivity] as it encourages firms to pay out dividends [rather] than reinvest for growth,\" he said.\n\nFirms reinvesting for growth is precisely what the Reserve Bank believes is a critical pillar for supporting productivity in the Australian economy.",

        "text": "On a weekend where a lot of things needed to go right for Oscar Piastri, pretty much everything went wrong for the Australian.\n\nPiastri entered the S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix weekend trailing his teammate Lando Norris by one point in the drivers' championship standings.\n\nAt the end of the weekend, Piastri's deficit is now 24 points, and his hopes of a maiden world championship appear to be fading fast.\n\nHere is how the championship standings are poised heading into the final three rounds of the season.\n\nLando Norris takes big lead in the F1 standings\n\nNorris was excellent in Brazil.\n\nHe was the fastest in the qualifying sessions for the sprint race and the grand prix.\n\nPiastri's F1 title hopes take massive blow Oscar Piastri's Formula 1 title challenge has taken another blow, with a controversial penalty costing the Australian in Brazil.\n\nOn both occasions, he converted pole position into victory to claim the maximum 33 points for the weekend.\n\nIn doing so, he extended his margin to both Piastri and Red Bull's Max Verstappen.\n\nPiastri crashed out on lap six of 24 in the sprint race, and a penalty in the grand prix restricted the Australian to finishing fifth. That netted the Australian 10 points for the weekend.\n\nMax Verstappen had a better weekend, placing fourth in the sprint race and finishing third in the grand prix.\n\nThat yielded Verstappen a total of 20 points, but the Dutchman may wonder what could have been.\n\nAfter a horrid qualifying for the grand prix, where he was 16th fastest, the Red Bull driver started the race on Monday morning AEDT from the pit lane.\n\nDespite that, Verstappen was just 10 seconds behind Norris at the end of the grand prix. Verstappen was not only the best driver on the track, but he also had the fastest car. With a better grid position, he could have won that race.\n\nAt the end of round 21, Norris leads the championship with 390 points.\n\nPiastri is 24 points behind on 366, while Verstappen is a further 25 points adrift on 341.\n\nWhat does Norris have to do to win the F1 title?\n\nLando Norris is in pole position to claim his maiden Formula 1 drivers' championship.\n\nWith three rounds remaining, his 24-point lead to Piastri is massive when you consider a driver receives 25 points for a grand prix win.\n\nThere are three grands prix and one sprint race left this season, with a maximum of 83 points available.\n\nAs it stands, Norris does not need to win another race this season to become champion.\n\nIf Piastri won all four remaining races this season, he would end the year on 449 points.\n\nIf Norris finished second in all four races, he would score 61 points and finish with a total of 451 points, winning the world championship by two.\n\nStream End Game with Tony Armstrong on ABC iview Tony Armstrong tackles Australia's overdue reckoning with racism in sport with the help of some of its biggest sports stars.\n\n\"I think in terms of the championship, there's no point thinking about it very much,\" Piastri said after the grand prix in Brazil.\n\n\"There's clearly some things we need to sort out. Just a tough weekend from a number of fronts, so I'll focus on that instead.\"\n\nVerstappen almost certainly would need to win every race remaining this season and have both McLarens struggle to claim the championship for a fifth consecutive year.\n\nThe next race is the Las Vegas Grand Prix, which will be held on Sunday, November 23.",

        "text": "Oscar Piastri's hopes of winning his maiden Formula 1 drivers' championship this season have been severely damaged, and a contentious penalty in Brazil has worsened the blow.\n\nPiastri was penalised for causing a collision during Monday's (AEDT) S\u00e3o Paulo Grand Prix at Interlagos, which resulted in Ferrari's Charles Leclerc crashing out of the race.\n\nThe stewards handed Piastri a 10-second penalty, which robbed the Australian of the chance to finish on the podium and lessen the deficit to race winner and championship leader, Lando Norris.\n\nPost-race, Piastri was clearly frustrated by the penalty, while Leclerc, who had his race ended by the incident, believed the Australian should not be given all of the blame.\n\nWhat happened in the crash?\n\nThe flashpoint of the grand prix came on lap six of 71.\n\nThe drivers had been behind the safety car following a crash to Sauber driver Gabriel Bortoleto on the first lap.\n\nPiastri's F1 title hopes take massive blow Oscar Piastri's Formula 1 title challenge has taken another blow, with a controversial penalty costing the Australian in Brazil.\n\nAt the end of the fifth lap, the safety car pulled into the pits and race leader Norris was in control of the field to restart racing on lap six.\n\nWhen Norris put his foot down, it appeared to catch second-place driver Kimi Antonelli (Mercedes) off guard.\n\nAs Norris drove off to the first corner, Antonelli was swarmed by third-placed Leclerc and fourth-placed Piastri.\n\nThe trio arrived at the first corner together \u2014 a tight left-hand turn that goes downhill.\n\nLeclerc had gone around the outside of Antonelli, while Piastri had taken the inside line.\n\nAntonelli was marginally ahead of Piastri as they both went for the apex of the corner.\n\nAs Antonelli cut across Piastri's line, the Australian slammed on the brakes and briefly locked his front tyres.\n\nPiastri hit the side of Antonelli's car. The shunt forced Antonelli's Mercedes across the track and into the Ferrari of Leclerc, who was an innocent bystander.\n\nPiastri moved into second place as Antonelli and Leclerc went off the track.\n\nAntonelli was able to rejoin in third place, while Leclerc lost a wheel on his Ferrari and was forced to retire.\n\nWhy was Piastri penalised for the crash?\n\nPiastri, now in second place, immediately got onto his team radio to protest that the crash was not his fault.\n\n\"He left me no space,\" Piastri said, referring to Antonelli.\n\nBut the race stewards took a very different view.\n\nAfter investigating the incident, the stewards deemed that the Australian was \"wholly responsible for the collision\", and penalised him 10 seconds, which was served during Piastri's first pit stop.\n\nThis was the explanation given by the stewards:\n\nAt the Safety Car restart on Lap 6, Car 81 (Oscar Piastri) attempted to overtake Car 12 (Kimi Antonelli) on the inside of Turn 1. In doing so, PIA did not establish the required overlap prior to and at the apex, as his front axle was not alongside the mirror of Car 12, as defined in the Driving Standard Guidelines for overtaking on the inside of a corner. PIA locked the brakes as he attempted to avoid contact by slowing, but was unable to do so and made contact with ANT. This contact caused ANT to make secondary contact with Car 16 (Charles Leclerc), who was positioned on the outside and was forced to retire from the race as a result. PIA was therefore wholly responsible for the collision.\n\nThe main reason the stewards deemed Piastri at fault was for not being close enough to the front of Antonelli's car.\n\nFor several years, a guideline for any driver passing on the inside is to have the front axle at least alongside the mirror of the rival they are attempting to overtake.\n\nBy not meeting this, in the stewards' determination, Piastri was in the wrong spot and this is the reason contact was made between him and Antonelli.\n\nThe stewards also noted that Piastri had locked his brakes going into the corner. Having control of the car is something the stewards would have also considered when making their decision.\n\nDespite not being explicitly stated, the locking of the brakes from Piastri would not have helped his cause during the stewards' investigation.\n\nWas Piastri unlucky to receive a 10-second penalty?\n\nTo the letter of the law, the stewards probably made the right call.\n\nHowever, trying to have black-and-white rules in a sport that is in a state of perpetual grey areas is fraught with danger and inconsistency.\n\nAs the three drivers approached the corner, there was plenty of space for all three if they stayed in their lanes.\n\nPiastri clearly had a car's width of room as he approached the corner, and that was quickly taken away when Antonelli turned in on the Australian.\n\nDrivers are required to give opponents at least a car's width if they are battling.\n\nThree-time W Series champion, and Sky Sports pundit, Jamie Chadwick said she felt the only driver who did not use the space well was Antonelli.\n\n\"The person who hasn't used all the room is Kimi [Antonelli] for me,\" Chadwick said post-race.\n\n\"So I'm on the side where Oscar has been hard done by. I feel like he [Antonelli] could've held position but made his life easier.\"\n\nThe stewards could have also deemed the collision as a racing incident, something often cited when contact is made but no driver had necessarily done anything wrong.\n\nMany collisions, usually on the first lap of a race, are deemed racing incidents because so many cars are in a small section of the circuit.\n\nWith that precedent, there is an argument to be made that the collision between Piastri and Antonelli could have been deemed a racing incident because it was the first corner after a safety car restart.\n\nBut again, the stewards were not siding with the Australian and whacked him with the penalty.\n\nWhat did the drivers say about the crash?\n\nPiastri cut a frustrated figure in the media pen after the race.\n\nHis title hopes had been damaged, and he finished lower than hoped due to a contentious penalty.\n\nOscar Piastri moved into second after overtakeing Kimi Antonelli and Charlec Leclerc, but was penalised for making contact during the move. (Reuters: Amanda Perobelli)\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports, Piastri did not believe he could have done anything else, and he was not given enough space by Antonelli.\n\n\"I had a very clear opportunity, I went for it,\" Piastri said.\n\n\"The other two [Antonelli and Leclerc] on the outside braked quite late.\n\n\"There was obviously a bit of a lock-up into the corner, but that was because I could see Kimi [Antonelli] wasn't going to give me any space.\n\n\"I can't disappear, but the decision is what it is.\"\n\nAntonelli, unsurprisingly, took a different view of the incident, with the teenager stating he needed to leave room for Leclerc on the outside.\n\n\"[Piastri] locked up and started to miss the apex,\" Antonelli said. \"It was a big hit, to be fair.\"\n\nPiastri did find an ally \u2014 of sorts \u2014 in Leclerc, who was taken out of the race by no fault of his own.\n\nStream End Game with Tony Armstrong on ABC iview Tony Armstrong tackles Australia's overdue reckoning with racism in sport with the help of some of its biggest sports stars.\n\nAfter seeing the replay, Leclerc described Piastri's overtaking attempt as \"optimistic\", but, unlike the stewards, did not believe the crash was all on the Australian.\n\n\"Oscar was optimistic, but Kimi knew Oscar was on the inside \u2026 and he kind of did the corner like Oscar was never there,\" Lelcerc said.\n\n\"For me, the blame is not all on Oscar.\n\n\"Yes, it was optimistic. But this could have been avoided.\"\n\nWhat is next for Piastri's championship fight?\n\nThere are three rounds left in the Formula 1 season, and Oscar Piastri has an uphill battle to win the championship.\n\nNorris leads with 390 points, 24 points ahead of Piastri on 366.\n\nThere are three grands prix and one sprint race left this season, with a maximum of 83 points available.\n\nIf Piastri won all four remaining races this season, he would end the year on 449 points.\n\nIf Lando Norris finished second in all four races, he would score 61 points and finish with a total of 451 points \u2014 winning the world championship by two.\n\nPiastri almost certainly needs to win the three remaining grands prix, and then needs Norris to have a dip in form, to become Australia's first driver's champion in 45 years.\n\nThe next race is the Las Vegas Grand Prix, which will be held on Sunday, November 23.",

However, during the submission period last year for the strategic review, it called on the public to support its cable car plan.\n\nThe company has welcomed the news that a cable car may be recommended in the action plan for the mountain, but declined to comment on whether it planned to put forward another proposal for one.\n\nMr Bayley said the issue \"should have been settled\".\n\nVica Bayley has described the draft recommendations as \"deeply disturbing\".

        "text": "John Laws was above all things a performer \u2014 and a highly skilled one at that.\n\nIn 2012, Laws \u2014 who died on the weekend aged 90 \u2014 agreed to join me on the ABC's 7.30 program for an interview to discuss outrageous remarks made by another powerful radio announcer, Alan Jones, regarding then-prime minister, Julia Gillard.\n\nDuring the second half of the 1980s, the 1990s and most of the first decade of the 2000s, Alan Jones and John Laws were the dual titans of AM talkback radio in Australia.\n\nThere was plenty of rivalry between them and little love lost.\n\nSo when Jones landed at the centre of a national scandal after he told a Young Liberals dinner that John Gillard had \"died of shame\" because of his daughter's \"lies\", Laws was happy to comment.\n\nLaws agreed to the interview, but he didn't want to come into the studio and instead requested we send a camera to his penthouse on Sydney's Woolloomooloo wharf.\n\nBreaking: Veteran radio broadcaster John Laws has died aged 90 Known as the \"Golden Tonsils\", Laws was one of Australia's most recognisable voices in talkback radio.\n\nTechnology wasn't quite so slick then as it is now, and in those circumstances we preferred to pre-record the interview and then turn it around for the live program \u2014 just in case the line dropped out.\n\nI headed into the studio an hour or so before airtime and on the screen in front of me, up popped the transmission from Laws's apartment.\n\nThe sight of the then-77-year-old was instantly entertaining, before he said even a word.\n\nHe was seated indoors but was wearing sunglasses and had a scarf draped around his neck.\n\nIn his right hand, he swirled a glass with a huge pour of bourbon and Coke.\n\nVisible through the window behind him was an immense navy ship docked at the Garden Island military base.\n\n\"Please god,\" I thought to myself as we waited to roll, \"don't let the cameraman ask him to put down the drink or take off the glasses.\"\n\nThe universe answered my prayer and Laws stayed exactly as he was.\n\nJohn Laws on air in 2007. (AAP: Tracey Nearmy)\n\n'Did you enjoy it?'\n\nWe began the interview with me asking Laws about the Jones remark.\n\nLaws began to speak and he then removed the sunglasses with a flourish, before condemning the remark as careless, hasty and cruel.\n\nHe was surprisingly kind to his former 2UE stablemate and rival, though, saying \u2014 in effect \u2014 we all make mistakes.\n\nPerhaps Laws was circumspect, given he was no stranger to national disgrace himself.\n\nIn 2004, he was caught in a \"cash-for-comment\" scandal when he was revealed to have spruiked products and services for a fee, passing it off as his personal opinion without disclosing the kickbacks he received.\n\nOn 7.30 in 2012, Laws held forth with his customary flair and confidence and then, as I wrapped up, he delivered probably the most memorable and amusing ending to any interview I've done.\n\n\"John Laws, thank you very much for making time to speak to us tonight,\" I said.\n\n\"Did you enjoy it?\" Laws replied.\n\n\"I did enjoy it, did you?\"\n\nLaws chuckled gleefully.\n\n\"Yeah, I loved every minute,\" he said.\n\nThat interview went so viral that people still occasionally mention it to me. The week when it aired, strangers came up to me nonstop to share a laugh about it every time I left the house.\n\nOn the Friday night, I was meeting friends for a drink and the bartender unexpectedly presented me with a cocktail and said: \"I've made this bespoke for you; I'm calling it the John Laws Special.\" He'd crafted something bourbon-based.\n\nI'm sure some ABC viewers thought Laws was crazy to show up on 7.30 and attempt to flirt with me while sipping a Wild Turkey. Crazy like a fox if you ask me!\n\nJohn Laws presenting his last radio show in November 2024. (ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\nLaws knew how to hold an audience\n\nWhy did the interview make such a splash? Because Laws was wildly entertaining. And that's the reason he lasted on Australian radio for about 70 years and why no other Australian broadcaster has come near his longevity or success.\n\nIt was why he was paid a fortune and even furnished by his network with a microphone made of gold.\n\nLike him or loathe him, he indisputably knew how to deliver an engaging broadcast and hold the attention of a loyal audience.\n\nHis interviews with prime ministers such as John Howard and Paul Keating were mandatory listening when I was a young reporter. He spoke to the top dogs the same way he spoke to his listeners when they rang in.\n\nLaws adored the attention that his 7.30 appearance delivered him. Ever after, he always warmly invited me on whatever radio program he was hosting if I had an ABC project or a book to promote. And he always finished our encounters by asking, of course, if it had been good for me.",

(Getty Images: Timothy Rogers)\n\nAfter watching his strike rate as Wallabies coach slip to 42 per cent, one of the worst in history, Schmidt called for fans to remain patient ahead of Australia's hosting of the World Cup in less than two years' time.\n\n\"There's still a lot of work to do to get them to where they need to be,\" he said.\n\n\"I've had lots of experience coaching a lot of Test matches and had teams that have been number one in the world, and I know what it takes to get there.\n\n\"And I know the strength and depth that you need and we're setting about trying to build that.\n\n\"We'll reflect on what we put out there tonight, what we can build on and what we need to make sure we improve upon.\n\n\"All I can say to people is that we believe in what we can deliver. Don't lose faith because we will guarantee to keep working as hard as we can to try to demonstrate what it means to us, to try to be as competitive as possible.\"\n\nStream End Game with Tony Armstrong on ABC iview Tony Armstrong tackles Australia's overdue reckoning with racism in sport with the help of some of its biggest sports stars.\n\nAfter making his first, indifferent start for the Wallabies since his return from a one-season stint in the NRL, playmaker Carter Gordon hobbled off with a quad strain midway through the second half of Saturday's 26-19 loss in Udine.\n\nThe Wallabies will consider calling in England-based veteran James O'Connor as fly half cover for the remaining Tests of the tour against Ireland and France.\n\n\"James would probably add a bit of freshness,\" Schmidt said.\n\n\"I haven't spoken to him about coming in. I've stayed in touch with him. He's had a good break over the last week or so, so he's been able to freshen up a little bit.\n\n\"Those are the decisions, probably tomorrow morning when we meet up before we head to the airport for a long old travel day, that we'll have a bit of a chat about.\n\n\"Because what we'll be looking for first is just to get all the medical information so that we know who's fit to go and who we might need as cover.\"\n\nWhile no doubt a lucrative exercise for Rugby Australia, the Wallabies are enduring a 15-Test calendar year for the first time since 2016.\n\n\"We're not looking for excuses,\" Schmidt said.\n\n\"We're just going to dust ourselves off and fire into the next one.\n\n\"We have to demonstrate some character.\"\n\nAAP/ABC\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

The episode, recorded the night before as is standard with previous premieres, had to pause for two hours due to lightning risks, with much of the crowd evidently dissipating in the time between. It won\u2019t be the only surprise Big Brother throws at Tracina.\n\nIt\u2019s early days, but the show has been refreshingly raw, with contestants eschewing rehearsed entrance lines, visibly nervous and shaken by the experience. As you would be, locked in a house with 11 strangers with conflicting beliefs and life experiences. With the premiere filmed on Saturday, we got to whizz through their first night, where connections formed fast \u2013 as did storm clouds, or what seemed to be slight friction between several housemates.\n\nLoading\n\nWhen Michael entered, for example, he didn\u2019t introduce himself to Abiola, a 24-year-old \u201cloud, fat, Black lesbian\u201d. It could have been nerves, but the small moment stuck out. Abiola is one of two people of colour cast on Big Brother, alongside Mia, 23, a Sri Lankan woman whose slightly shrill excitement immediately seemed to put her on the outs with her housemates.\n\nHowever, the cast features more men with moustaches and people with names beginning with C than it does non-white housemates. It\u2019s not at all representative of Australia \u2013 an odd, disappointing choice given how, as naff as it seems to say, reality shows can really allow audiences to understand different perspectives. The imbalance could also easily create an uncomfortable tension. (A spoiler from last night\u2019s livestream: Abiola and Mia are voted two of the house\u2019s most annoying contestants in a challenge.)",

There was a time when he could see himself playing football for Brisbane Lions, before he begrudgingly accepted a local cricket call-up. But he has since shown his ability to counter-punch. In last summer\u2019s Sheffield Shield final he notched a century in the face of a 166-run first innings\u2019 deficit, with a resolve strikingly similar to batting legend Steve Smith. Jack Clayton celebrates a century at a Sheffield Shield match at the Gabba. Credit: Getty Images At 36, Smith is closer to the end of his illustrious career, preparing for what could be his final Ashes campaign on home soil. Clayton, 26, is in the discussion to one day replace him. En route to 113 against New South Wales last week at the Gabba, rebuilding the innings after Usman Khawaja (87) and Lachie Hearne (nine) fell in quick succession, the left-hander went some ways to vindicating that claim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd with Australian selectors showing a willingness to pick players well into their careers \u2013 31-year-old Jake Weatherald earning an Ashes call-up \u2013 time is on Clayton\u2019s side. \u201cObviously, I\u2019d love to throw my name into that mix, but my focus is to score runs for Queensland, and the rest will take care of itself,\u201d he said. Loading \u201cI think previously when I\u2019ve started to think about things like that, or in grade cricketing trying to play for Queensland, you get too worried about selection at a higher level, and you lose focus on the here and now. \u201cMy favourite player was Mike Hussey, and he didn\u2019t debut until his 30s. \u201cI\u2019m just beginning my journey, but I think it definitely does give hope to anybody in state cricket who\u2019s not necessarily young but a bit older and knocking the door down. \u201cThere are opportunities there, and selectors pick people who score runs \u2013 that\u2019s your main currency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClayton has slowly built his resume away from the spotlight. An off-season spent tightening his technique has paid dividends, working closely with Test star Marnus Labuschagne. Against the Blues, he looked rock solid defensively on the front foot, drove with precision, was quick to get into his hook and cut, and was unafraid to take on Test spinner Nathan Lyon. But despite a tendency to thrive the more challenging a situation, he remains frustrated by not converting promising starts into groundbreaking knocks. \u201cHave you been talking to Uzzie [Khawaja]?\u201d Clayton asks with a laugh. \u201cAfter the last game, he said, \u2018You\u2019ve got a few hundreds now, I want a big hundred\u2019. \u201cI was having a think after the last game, and you can almost put too much pressure on yourself to go out there and make that hundred a really big one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut you get to a hundred doing what you did. Keep doing that for as long as you can, and don\u2019t get out of that bubble. \u201cI definitely think it\u2019s something I love when the game\u2019s on the line. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it just seems to focus me on what I need to do, and I need to find a way to get into that mindset more often.\u201d Clayton\u2019s fate could have been so different. Loading A former member of the Brisbane Lions academy, Clayton\u2019s junior sporting days were littered with schoolboy honours, and even a 2016 Rising Star nomination in the second division North East Australian Football League. His cricket return came by chance \u2013 playing third-grade for the University of Queensland in the footy off-season, before accepting a second division invitation with a sigh.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Share\n\nDaphne, the sophomore opening for Hannah Green \u2013 owner of hatted Brunswick East diner Etta \u2013 has been created as a chameleon. It\u2019s not a pub or a wine bar or a restaurant. It\u2019s all of the above and more, intended to be a neighbourhood institution. A few doors down from Etta on Lygon Street, Daphne is what Green calls her \u201cpublic house\u201d. The 125-seat bar and restaurant is \u201cfun, loose and for you to use as you see fit\u201d, she says. It\u2019s a more easygoing \u2013 and economical \u2013 experience than what Etta has flourished into. Hannah Green\u2019s Daphne is a pub, wine bar and restaurant rolled into one neighbourhood institution. Ashley Ludkin Designed by IF Architecture (Etta, Cutler, Baker Bleu), Daphne is a fresh face for the space once home to the longstanding Cafe Romantica, but known most recently as Bar Romantica. \u201cI wanted to pay respect to the site because it was fairly iconic,\u201d Green says. \u201cBut I also wanted to bring light in.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the original terrazzo floor and popcorn-look vermiculite ceiling remain, the room has been brightened in a big way. \u201cEverything is reflective,\u201d Green says, from the iridescent 3D-printed lightshades to the stainless-steel open kitchen. New street-side seating flows into a casual front bar where you order at the counter. Beyond: a full-service bistro with clothed tables and a curtained-off private dining room. 1 / 9 From left: Pip Littore, chef Diana Desensi and owner Hannah Green.

The same menu runs across the front bar and bistro, featuring a dish Desensi cooked for Green to help her get the gig. It\u2019s a half chicken that\u2019s brined, \u201cdunked in herb butter so the whole thing kind of mummifies\u201d, then roasted to golden perfection in the wood-fire oven before being served with blistered grapes and a salty-sweet agrodolce-like sauce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If it hasn\u2019t been done before, we\u2019re not doing it.\u2019 Daphne chef Diana Desensi Other highlights include a fermented potato flatbread with mussels escabeche and whipped cod roe, and unusually exciting salads like a colourful cobb and an heirloom tomato medley with all the flavours of a Bloody Mary. Weekly \u201cneighbourhood nights\u201d each have a different hero item. Go for $15 martinis on Mondays (and get an olive stamp on your loyalty card so your 10th is free), $30 steak with fries on Tuesdays, and $25 handmade pasta on Wednesdays. There\u2019s also a kids\u2019 menu, and a supper menu on Fridays and Saturdays. With last orders at midnight, it appropriately stars a midnight spaghetti jam-packed with anchovies and capers. The Guinness Americano cocktail tastes like a \u201cchocolate negroni\u201d.

Given their cashflows, balance sheets and pristine credit ratings \u2013 between them, they had little to no net debt when this splurge in AI spending started \u2013 they can afford their investments.\n\nThere are others, like OpenAI and other AI start-ups, that are making massive commitments (in OpenAI\u2019s case about $US1.4 trillion) without the funding for them in place, relying on access to the equity markets and, to some degree, on circular finance and financial engineering \u2013 securing funding from chipmakers, for instance, in return for agreeing to buy the equivalent value of chips.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nMeet Thea Baker.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's a clinical psychologist who has heard plenty of stories of trauma, coming from the experiences of women and girls trying to navigate the Victorian health care system.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Ms Baker says she has also been there herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI've had two gynaecological surgeries and four hip surgeries, including a hip replacement all in the last 10 years ... One of the things that I found most difficult though is postoperatively being not believed with the amount of pain that I've experienced as I've come out of anaesthetic and basically being told that I'm making a fuss and having to wait a really long time between doses.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Victorian state government has just released the final report of an inquiry into women's experiences of pain, an investigation prompted by stories just like this one.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inquiry was conducted by the Women's Health Advisory Council and a panel of experts in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt received a massive number of submissions: 13,000 women and girls aged between 12 and 79, as well as their carers, clinicians, and associated organisations.\n\n\n\n\n\nPremier Jacinta Allan says women not being taken seriously was a common theme in many of the stories it heard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere's a kind of pain that women and girls are just constantly told that they have to learn to live with it. The kind that we are all told is normal. Whether it's the heavy periods, the crippling cramps that come with that sort of pain. We're also told to push through it. We're taught that we just have to push through it and put up with it. And I know all this because I've lived through this experience myself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe repot has made clear just how extensive the problems are.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most common conditions women experienced were menstrual and hormonal pain, endometriosis, and musculoskeletal problems, like arthritis.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's found 90 per cent of submissions to the inquiry reported experiencing pain lasting more than a year, while over half had daily pain.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Sonya Grover is the head of the department of Gynaecology at the Royal Children's Hospital - and she says that's deeply concerning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe know that untreated pain affects everything: their sleep, their moods, their participation in sports, their schooling, their self confidence. But we also know that if we intervene early, we can change that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the report says that finding early assistance has proved problematic.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile 95 percent sought help for their pain, just over 70 percent said they'd been dismissed or faced discrimination when they sought care.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe situation was even worse for those with disabilities, or from the LGBTIQ plus community, people from different cultural backgrounds, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and girls.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria's Health Minister, Mary-Anne Thomas, says as a result, many women and girls have not been properly diagnosed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNow women have told us that when they go to seek treatment for their pain, it's often their mental health that is being treated. They're prescribed antidepressants but the cause of their pain is not being diagnosed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Minister says that the report has identified a key barrier to treatment is the nature of the workforce itself.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says some health care professionals just don't have the knowledge to help their female patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe body of knowledge that we have when it comes to delivering health care has been built on men's experience and their biology. This is just a fact. It's is not a judgement, it's just a fact. We do not yet know enough about the many causes of pain that women are experiencing. It hasn't been researched and it hasn't been taught.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe state government plans to introduce a new standard of care.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Premier says the Women's Pain Standard will be rolled out across Victoria's health system once it's been developed, to start to change things for the better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is understanding that the culture to date has been silence and not understanding women's pain. So by setting a new health care standard it is about sending a very, very clear message about the expectations that we set to support women to get the care they need across our health system.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Standard is likely to form part of the overall action plan for women's pain that the government says it will put together over the next six months.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Health Minister says they're not waiting to take action.\n\n\n\n\n\nA specialist clinic is to be established at the Royal Children's Hospital, and she's committed to a pilot of a device known as the 'green whistle', essentially an inhaler for pain relief that will give women a level of control over their pain during IUD insertion or removal.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical Director of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Peninsula Health, Dr Nisha Knot, says their service has already introduced the green whistle - and that a rollout of the device to all 20 Sexual and Reproductive Health Hubs in Victoria will be a welcome move.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe all know that an IUD is an excellent contraception. It's also good for heavy periods, it's also good for period pain. And it seemed like such a shame that women were not able to use an IUD because their experience of getting an IUD inserted or changed was so painful. So it seemed like a win-win for everyone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Women's Health Victoria chief executive, Sally Hasler, the release of the report is a watershed moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's called it a powerful collection of evidence from women that things need to change.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the Victorian and Commonwealth governments need to work together to implement the report's ambitious recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's the hope of Thea Baker, too.\n\n\n\n",

As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Free speech fears continue to roil US as Trump says unfair media coverage is 'illegal'\n\nThe Daily Telegraph had reported for days on an internal document produced by a former BBC adviser on standards who had listed a raft of errors, including in the way a speech by Trump on 6 January 2021 was edited.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe document suggested the Panorama program had edited two parts of Trump's speech together so he appeared to directly encourage the Capitol Hill riots of January 2021 \u2014 cutting out a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, Trump was still disputing then-president Joe Biden's election victory, in a vote that resulted in him being ousted after his first term in office.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe edit was included in a documentary titled Trump: A Second Chance? that was broadcast by the BBC the week before last year's US election.\n\n\n\nAllegations of 'bias'\n\nUK culture, media and sport minister Lisa Nandy said the Trump edit was one of several concerns about editorial standards at the BBC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It isn't just about the Panorama program, although that is incredibly serious,\" she told BBC television in an interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are a series of very serious allegations made, the most serious of which is that there is systemic bias in the way that difficult issues are reported at the BBC,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nNandy said she was concerned about a tendency for editorial standards and the language used in reports to be \"entirely inconsistent\" whether it be on \"Israel, Gaza ... trans people or on this issue about President Trump\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe licence fee-funded broadcaster issued several apologies earlier this year for \"serious flaws\" in the making of another documentary, titled Gaza: How To Survive A Warzone, which was broadcast in February.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn October, it accepted a sanction from the UK media watchdog for what was deemed a \"materially misleading\" program, whose child narrator was later revealed to be the son of Hamas's former deputy agriculture minister.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease disproportionately affects women \u2014 and now a new international project, involving an Australian researcher, has received a $4 million boost to try and find out why.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Kaarin Anstey, the director of the University of NSW's Ageing Futures Institue, and the University of California's Professor Kristine Yaffe have been jointly awarded the funding to investigate the phenomenon of the disease, which some health bodies place as among Australia's leading causes of death.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnstey said a lot of research into Alzheimer's \u2014 the most common form of dementia \u2014 hasn't considered \"sex-specific factors\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We hope that by studying hormonal variability and aspects of women's health that have previously been dismissed, we may uncover clues to explain women's greater risk of Alzheimer's disease,\" she said.\n\n\n\nWhy are women more prone to Alzheimer's?\n\nAnstey, whose work is being funded by United States-based charity Wellcome Leap, said there are differences in brain structures between the binary sexes, which could explain the differences in the prevalence of Alzheimer's.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said there are not enough study participants who identify as non-binary or transgender to have reliable data for those groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there could be a link between an increased risk of Alzheimer's and hormonal changes in women, the reason behind the \"imbalance\" is unclear.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE More than a million Australians could be living with dementia in 40 years. These are possible risk factors\n\nShe said one reason is that Alzheimer's statistics tend not to take sex into account, and treat men and women the same, despite \"the large differences in biology and risk of Alzheimer's\".\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said there are two main goals for her future studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Overall, the most urgent priority is to learn how to reduce the risk of dementia and slow cognitive decline so that we can develop interventions to prevent it,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Second, making sure these women's health issues are given the same weight in our research as other factors like cardiovascular disease, so that they are not ignored or dismissed as unimportant,\" Anstey said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need all the clues and information available to progress the massive task of preventing cognitive decline and impairment in ageing.\"\n\n\n\nDo men and women experience Alzheimer's differently?\n\nAssociate Professor Fiona Kumfor from the University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Centre and co-founder of the Dementia Law Network said understanding the differences in how men and women experience Alzheimer's is an \"important area for future research\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There hasn't been a lot of research examining sex differences, but some evidence suggests that women may have more depressive symptoms and changes in beliefs, such as delusions, whereas men may experience more loss in motivation which can lead to apathy,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause women tend to live longer than men, there is a higher number of women living with Alzheimer's.\n\n\n\nKumfor said that women are also more likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's than men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Although men are at greater risk of other dementia types like some types of frontotemporal dementia and vascular dementia,\" Kumfor said.\n\n\n\nAre there risk factors for dementia?\n\nAnstey said it's important to look at modifiable risk factors that can improve health outcomes for people with Alzheimer's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While we know that many risk factors for dementia are modifiable, the effect of each may not be the same in men and women. The more we can understand, the more we can intervene to prevent it,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lancet, a prominent medical journal, has tracked 14 modifiable risk factors in its research into dementia .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paper's authors state nearly half of all dementia cases worldwide could be prevented or delayed by addressing these risk factors.\n\n\n\nThe common mid-life risk factors include hearing loss, high LDL cholesterol, social isolation and depression. Source: SBS News The mid-life risk factors include hearing loss, high LDL cholesterol (or 'bad' cholesterol), social isolation and depression.\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging these risk factors, particularly in the early and middle stages of life, could potentially prevent or delay dementia cases by 45 per cent, according to the research published in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome academics have commended The Lancet study, but say it's not possible to conclusively link these risk factors directly to dementia .\n\n\n\nDiagnosis and prevention\n\nProfessor Scott Ayton, from the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, told SBS News there is a \"considerable challenge\" around the world when it comes to diagnosing Alzheimer's.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut recent research shows there is an over 90 per cent success rate in diagnosing Alzheimer's by looking at blood-based biomarkers, according to Ayton.\n\n\n\n\n\nKumfor said that while most cases of Alzheimer's start with changes in memory, that's not the case for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For some people, the earliest changes might be in language, navigation, planning or behaviour,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Where the presentation is 'atypical', or if people develop symptoms at a younger age \u2014 under 65 years old \u2014 this can make diagnosis particularly difficult.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile diagnosis continues to be an obstacle in Alzheimer's care, preventing symptoms like memory loss from worsening is also a focus for researchers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAyton said two drugs are now available in Australia \u2014 donanemab and lecanemab \u2014 which could help people with cognitive decline.\n\n\n\nHowever, Ayton said more research is needed to assess the impact of these medications, while there are widely accepted benefits for people with Alzheimer's when they make lifestyle changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What's good for the heart is good for the brain,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Exercise, heart health and diet are shown to make a difference with prevention.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said when addressing health concerns, it's \"earlier the better\" for the best outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hypertension has been shown to increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's. Dealing with hypertension at midlife will have better results than addressing it later on in life,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKumfor said speaking with psychologists and lawyers early on can help people with Alzheimer's to prepare for long-term challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Alzheimer's disease is progressive, and people will develop more severe symptoms over time, so it is also important to speak to someone for support and think about future planning,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information in this article is for general information purposes only and should not be relied on as a substitute for professional medical advice.

Until recently, she had no idea that some of those ships might be carrying sanctioned oil from Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was in disbelief, to be honest,\" the 26-year-old told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn October, SBS revealed that Australia is the biggest importer of oil products refined from Russian crude oil in third countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia sanctioned the direct import of crude oil from Russia after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but experts say a \"shadow fleet\" of at least 25 ships continues to bring oil ashore via refineries in countries such as India and China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's blood oil,\" said Oryssia's mother, Luba Pryslak, who is president of the Association of Ukrainians in Victoria.\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainian community held a protest in Geelong on Saturday that was timed to meet the arrival of a tanker they suspect is carrying products refined from Russian crude oil. Source: Supplied Oryssia and Luba were among roughly 50 protesters who stood at the jetty in Geelong on Saturday morning to protest the arrival of a tanker believed to be transporting products refined from sanctioned Russian crude oil.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking after the rally, Luba told SBS News the Ukrainian community in Australia is calling on the government to close a loophole allowing such oil products to enter Australia and properly investigate whether current sanctions are effective.\n\n\n\n'Blood Oil'\n\nTo date, the government has sanctioned more than 150 \"shadow fleet\" ships, often uninsured vessels that avoid detection by regularly changing their nation of registry (a practice known as flag-hopping) and disabling their tracking systems, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, data provided to SBS News in October by the Centre of Research on Energy and Clean Air showed that 25 ships remain in the supply chain of Australian companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong has said there is no mechanism that would allow the government to track the origin of Russian crude oil that enters Australia via third-country refineries.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Senate estimates on 10 October, Wong said the government expects the private sector to manage its own supply chains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australians also expect businesses to prevent their supply chains from inadvertently funding Russia\u2019s illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine \u2014 and we ask businesses to uphold that responsibility,\" a DFAT spokesperson told SBS News.\n\n\n\nIn September, Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie likened the situation to that of diamonds mined in areas of conflict.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Over 10 years ago, Australia was calling for blood diamonds to be included in the international definition of conflict diamonds, and now we're accepting Russian blood oil,\" she said in the Senate.\n\n\n\n\n\nOryssia, who recently returned from a visit to Ukraine, said knowing Australian money is going back to Russia gives her \"a sense of guilt\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All these people in Ukraine are like 'thank you so much for your help'. And in our backhand, we're actually sliding more money over to Russia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You're putting money into the pockets of people who are bombing civilians,\" Oryssia said.\n\n\n\nSince Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, over 14,000 Ukrainian civilians have been killed and more than 37,000 injured, according to the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU).\n\n\n\n\n\nHRMMU head Danielle Bell said in early October: \"High civilian casualties last month confirm this year's disturbing pattern of intense violence in Ukraine, as virtually no day passes without civilian deaths or injuries, especially in frontline communities.\"\n\n\n\nMore transparency needed\n\nOn Wednesday, the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee launched a Senate inquiry into Russian sanctions, which will specifically look at how to stop the importation of fuels derived from Russian crude oil in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will report back in March 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nLuba said the Association of Ukrainians in Victoria want the inquiry to be moved forward.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We won't wait until March until we get a report while people are dying and suffering,\" she said.\n\n\n\nA building in Kyiv following a drone attack the previous night, captured by Oryssia on a recent trip to Ukraine. Source: Supplied Luba also told SBS News the association wants greater transparency and accountability for private fossil fuel companies when it comes to their supply chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Companies need to be more aware of their supply chain and where things are coming from, whether that comes from more government regulations [or somewhere else],\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Let's just be more transparent about what's really happening,\" Oryssia said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDFAT told SBS News that \"Australia remains steadfast in its support for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russia\u2019s illegal and immoral invasion.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a result of measures we have already taken, direct Australian imports of Russian energy products have fallen from $80 million to zero since before Russia\u2019s invasion,\" the spokesperson said, adding that the government was \"evaluating options to place further pressure on Russia\u2019s oil revenues\".\n\n\n\nKeeping Ukraine in 'eyesight'\n\nLuba said the Ukrainian community in Australia was mostly proud of how the Australian government has supported Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Ukrainian diaspora has been proud that Australia has been able to support Ukraine, sending Bushmasters and humanitarian and military support,\" Luba said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February, DFAT said it has committed more than $1.5 billion to help Ukraine defend itself, including more than $1.3 billion in military support through equipment and training.\n\n\n\nA photograph taken by Oryssia on a recent trip to Ukraine. Source: Supplied / Oryssia Pryslak However, with the conflict soon heading into its fourth year, Oryssia is concerned that \"war fatigue\" could be setting in \u2014 \"especially with so many horrible things happening all around the world\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australians say, 'oh you're Ukrainian, how's it all going'? And you have to say, 'it's going sh-t, actually'.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think Australians should really try to understand that we do need to keep it in our eyesight. We need to keep it in our minds.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's happening right now still.\"\n\n\n\n",

The episode, recorded the night before as is standard with previous premieres, had to pause for two hours due to lightning risks, with much of the crowd evidently dissipating in the time between. It won\u2019t be the only surprise Big Brother throws at Tracina.\n\nIt\u2019s early days, but the show has been refreshingly raw, with contestants eschewing rehearsed entrance lines, visibly nervous and shaken by the experience. As you would be, locked in a house with 11 strangers with conflicting beliefs and life experiences. With the premiere filmed on Saturday, we got to whizz through their first night, where connections formed fast \u2013 as did storm clouds, or what seemed to be slight friction between several housemates.\n\nLoading\n\nWhen Michael entered, for example, he didn\u2019t introduce himself to Abiola, a 24-year-old \u201cloud, fat, Black lesbian\u201d. It could have been nerves, but the small moment stuck out. Abiola is one of two people of colour cast on Big Brother, alongside Mia, 23, a Sri Lankan woman whose slightly shrill excitement immediately seemed to put her on the outs with her housemates.\n\nHowever, the cast features more men with moustaches and people with names beginning with C than it does non-white housemates. It\u2019s not at all representative of Australia \u2013 an odd, disappointing choice given how, as naff as it seems to say, reality shows can really allow audiences to understand different perspectives. The imbalance could also easily create an uncomfortable tension. (A spoiler from last night\u2019s livestream: Abiola and Mia are voted two of the house\u2019s most annoying contestants in a challenge.)",

There was a time when he could see himself playing football for Brisbane Lions, before he begrudgingly accepted a local cricket call-up. But he has since shown his ability to counter-punch. In last summer\u2019s Sheffield Shield final he notched a century in the face of a 166-run first innings\u2019 deficit, with a resolve strikingly similar to batting legend Steve Smith. Jack Clayton celebrates a century at a Sheffield Shield match at the Gabba. Credit: Getty Images At 36, Smith is closer to the end of his illustrious career, preparing for what could be his final Ashes campaign on home soil. Clayton, 26, is in the discussion to one day replace him. En route to 113 against New South Wales last week at the Gabba, rebuilding the innings after Usman Khawaja (87) and Lachie Hearne (nine) fell in quick succession, the left-hander went some ways to vindicating that claim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd with Australian selectors showing a willingness to pick players well into their careers \u2013 31-year-old Jake Weatherald earning an Ashes call-up \u2013 time is on Clayton\u2019s side. \u201cObviously, I\u2019d love to throw my name into that mix, but my focus is to score runs for Queensland, and the rest will take care of itself,\u201d he said. Loading \u201cI think previously when I\u2019ve started to think about things like that, or in grade cricketing trying to play for Queensland, you get too worried about selection at a higher level, and you lose focus on the here and now. \u201cMy favourite player was Mike Hussey, and he didn\u2019t debut until his 30s. \u201cI\u2019m just beginning my journey, but I think it definitely does give hope to anybody in state cricket who\u2019s not necessarily young but a bit older and knocking the door down. \u201cThere are opportunities there, and selectors pick people who score runs \u2013 that\u2019s your main currency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClayton has slowly built his resume away from the spotlight. An off-season spent tightening his technique has paid dividends, working closely with Test star Marnus Labuschagne. Against the Blues, he looked rock solid defensively on the front foot, drove with precision, was quick to get into his hook and cut, and was unafraid to take on Test spinner Nathan Lyon. But despite a tendency to thrive the more challenging a situation, he remains frustrated by not converting promising starts into groundbreaking knocks. \u201cHave you been talking to Uzzie [Khawaja]?\u201d Clayton asks with a laugh. \u201cAfter the last game, he said, \u2018You\u2019ve got a few hundreds now, I want a big hundred\u2019. \u201cI was having a think after the last game, and you can almost put too much pressure on yourself to go out there and make that hundred a really big one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cBut you get to a hundred doing what you did. Keep doing that for as long as you can, and don\u2019t get out of that bubble. \u201cI definitely think it\u2019s something I love when the game\u2019s on the line. \u201cI don\u2019t know, it just seems to focus me on what I need to do, and I need to find a way to get into that mindset more often.\u201d Clayton\u2019s fate could have been so different. Loading A former member of the Brisbane Lions academy, Clayton\u2019s junior sporting days were littered with schoolboy honours, and even a 2016 Rising Star nomination in the second division North East Australian Football League. His cricket return came by chance \u2013 playing third-grade for the University of Queensland in the footy off-season, before accepting a second division invitation with a sigh.\n\nAdvertisement",

Ashley Ludkin Designed by IF Architecture (Etta, Cutler, Baker Bleu), Daphne is a fresh face for the space once home to the longstanding Cafe Romantica, but known most recently as Bar Romantica. \u201cI wanted to pay respect to the site because it was fairly iconic,\u201d Green says. \u201cBut I also wanted to bring light in.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the original terrazzo floor and popcorn-look vermiculite ceiling remain, the room has been brightened in a big way. \u201cEverything is reflective,\u201d Green says, from the iridescent 3D-printed lightshades to the stainless-steel open kitchen. New street-side seating flows into a casual front bar where you order at the counter. Beyond: a full-service bistro with clothed tables and a curtained-off private dining room. 1 / 9 From left: Pip Littore, chef Diana Desensi and owner Hannah Green.

Shelley Horan Previous Slide Next Slide Presiding over the food is Diana Desensi, former head chef of Montalto and the now-closed Saint George, who has a simple motto: \u201cIf it hasn\u2019t been done before, we\u2019re not doing it.\u201d But that\u2019s not to say she isn\u2019t putting her own flair and flourishes on familiar dishes. The same menu runs across the front bar and bistro, featuring a dish Desensi cooked for Green to help her get the gig. It\u2019s a half chicken that\u2019s brined, \u201cdunked in herb butter so the whole thing kind of mummifies\u201d, then roasted to golden perfection in the wood-fire oven before being served with blistered grapes and a salty-sweet agrodolce-like sauce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018If it hasn\u2019t been done before, we\u2019re not doing it.\u2019 Daphne chef Diana Desensi Other highlights include a fermented potato flatbread with mussels escabeche and whipped cod roe, and unusually exciting salads like a colourful cobb and an heirloom tomato medley with all the flavours of a Bloody Mary. Weekly \u201cneighbourhood nights\u201d each have a different hero item. Go for $15 martinis on Mondays (and get an olive stamp on your loyalty card so your 10th is free), $30 steak with fries on Tuesdays, and $25 handmade pasta on Wednesdays. There\u2019s also a kids\u2019 menu, and a supper menu on Fridays and Saturdays. With last orders at midnight, it appropriately stars a midnight spaghetti jam-packed with anchovies and capers. The Guinness Americano cocktail tastes like a \u201cchocolate negroni\u201d. Shelley Horan As at Etta, the cocktails are a cut above, curated by drinks maverick Sam Peasnell who also lent his expertise to the drinks lists at Barragunda and Dom\u2019s Social Club. His take on the Americano Perfecto (topped with lager instead of the Americano\u2019s usual soda) subs in Guinness, which floats atop the Campari and vermouth for a low-ABV drink that he says tastes like a chocolate negroni.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Lygon Street hatted restaurant Etta to open more affordable sibling (and it\u2019s close by) Sommelier Ashley Boburka\u2019s wine list puts Victoria centre stage, including pinot gris and chilled sangiovese by Yarra Valley winemaker Valentine, both on tap for $10 a glass.

        "text": "Until now, questioning of the boom in investment in artificial intelligence has largely been confined to whether it constitutes a stockmarket bubble. Increasingly, the conversation will shift to whether that boom represents a threat to financial system stability.\n\nThe first phase of the sector\u2019s development has been largely, albeit not entirely, equity funded, with the mega techs \u2013 the so-called \u201chyperscalers\u201d like Google, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon \u2013 funding their massive investments in chips and data centres from their massive cash flows.\n\nThe combination of frothy asset values and leverage is a combustible one. Credit: AP\n\nBetween them, those companies will spend $US375 billion ($577 billion) on AI infrastructure and chips this year and closer to $US450 billion next year. Given their cashflows, balance sheets and pristine credit ratings \u2013 between them, they had little to no net debt when this splurge in AI spending started \u2013 they can afford their investments.\n\nThere are others, like OpenAI and other AI start-ups, that are making massive commitments (in OpenAI\u2019s case about $US1.4 trillion) without the funding for them in place, relying on access to the equity markets and, to some degree, on circular finance and financial engineering \u2013 securing funding from chipmakers, for instance, in return for agreeing to buy the equivalent value of chips.",

            "Australian Authorities Push To Combat Plastic Litter"
        ],
        "text": "There are plenty of things in Europe those living in Australia wish we had. Its variety of cultures and languages, peppered with iconic landmarks, inspires thousands to travel there every year.\n\nAside from the huge crowds, and crippling exchange rate which put a dampener on European travels, there is one quirk people around the world don't like about visiting Europe, and soon, millions of Australians will have to deal with the same issue.\n\nIn a major crackdown on plastic, the New South Wales government announced this week it will be getting rid of many household items like plastic fruit and veg stickers, soy sauce fish bottles and plastic bread tags in a bid to be more sustainable.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut, in a major change sure to divide people, it will become mandatory by 2030 for lids to be tethered to plastic bottles, and while many will bemoan the inconvenience, environmental campaigners told Yahoo News it's solving a \"really big issue\".\n\nTethered plastic bottle lid a change everyone must get used to\n\nThe tethered bottle lid became associated with European travel after a directive on the lids being attached was issued by the European Union in 2019, before becoming law in July, 2024. Many people have taken to social media to express their disdain for the feature.\n\nVideos from Aussies, Americans and Europeans filming themselves highlighting how frustrating it is to have the lid sticking out of the bottle as they drink from it. The bottle-lid combo has already become increasingly frequent in the UK as well, and many Brits aren't happy about it.\n\nBut it's a move long pushed by environmental advocates, like Lottie Dalziel, who runs recycling plastic business Banish. She told Yahoo News plastic lids are a \"really big contributor\" to litter, and the change will ultimately give us less litter to contend with in Australia.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"It's a really big issue. We've seen a great reduction in litter with the Return & Earn scheme in NSW, but bottle top lids in general are one of the most commonly littered items,\" she told Yahoo, explaining they are very commonly washed ashore at beaches.\n\nShe welcomes the change and said it will make the recycling process easier as the lids won't \"pop\" off during the crushing process, meaning they will be easier to handle and recycling facilities can treat the bottle as one piece of litter, rather than two.\n\n\"It's just change, and eventually everyone will get used to it. It'll just take a second,\" she said.\n\nAustralian authorities push to combat plastic litter\n\nAustralia generates significant plastic waste, with 3.2 million tonnes produced over the 2023-2024 financial year, up from three million the previous year, according to the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nStates and territories are trying to do their bit to reduce plastic waste, with NSW explaining the problem remains one of its biggest environmental challenges, with 74 per cent of litter in waterways being made up of plastic. Only 16 per cent of plastic waste is recycled in the state, with the remaining going to landfill.\n\n\"Microplastics are entering our bodies, and plastic is polluting our environment and oceans, killing our wildlife,\" NSW Minister for Environment, Penny Sharpe, said. \"Our plan has carefully considered actions we need to take to protect the environment and human health, while also considering how we can support industry to transition to recyclable or reusable alternatives.\"\n\nThe NSW Plastics Plan will be phased in over the coming years, and the following rules will be enacted:\n\nPlastic bread tags and pizza savers phased out by 2027\n\nTakeaway food service businesses must accept reusable cups by 2028\n\nNon-compostable plastic fruit and vegetable stickers phased out by 2030\n\nIntroduction of tethered lids for plastic bottles by 2030\n\nLarge food service businesses to provide reusable cup options by 2030\n\nSmall condiment containers, such as soy sauce fish bottles, will be phased out by 2030\n\nRedesign of takeaway food containers, such as plastic bowls with lids, bento boxes and sushi trays, to ensure they can be recycled safely\n\nRegulate harmful chemical additives in plastic food and beverage packaging to prevent toxins from entering soil, water and the food chain\n\nBan lighter-than-air (helium) balloon releases, in line with other states.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOther jurisdictions around the country are also taking steps to reduce plastic waste, with single-use plastic, such as cutlery and straws, being banned. Recently, South Australia introduced a state-wide ban on soy sauce fish bottles, something NSW is now following.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
