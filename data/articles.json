        "text": "T\ufeffo most people, $80 billion is an extraordinary amount of money. Where the GST is concerned, though, experts say it's not enough.\n\nThe decision by the Howard government to introduce the goods and services tax was an unpopular one 25 years ago, and it's little surp\ufeffrise politicians today are keen to avoid talking about raising it from its current 10 per cent.\n\nHowever, that's exactly what economists say needs to happen . This is why.\n\nEconomists are calling for the GST to be overhauled. (AFR Louie Douvis)\n\nWhy are there calls to change the GST?\n\nThe federal budget is in a structural deficit and desperately needs more revenue.\n\nAt the same time, government coffers are overly reliant on individual income tax, which accounts for more than half of all taxation revenue, and Treasurer Jim Chalmers has spoken about wanting to reduce tax strain on personal earnings.\n\nIf the government wants to reduce income tax, it doesn't have many options to replace that revenue, much less to do so while returning the budget to surplus.\n\nWinding back negative gearing and capital gains concessions have been ruled out, and a carbon tax \u2013 something proposed by former Treasury secretary Ken Henry \u2013 has proven political suicide in the past.\n\nAt the same time, consumption taxes like the GST cause very little economic damage compared to other options like excises and stamp duties.\n\n\"The GST and taxes like it are a much more efficient way of raising revenue,\" Professor Richard Holden from the University of NSW told 9News last week.\n\n\"They create less distortions, they do less damage to productivity and the economy.\"\n\nAgainst the backdrop of this economic picture is the government's upcoming productivity roundtable.\n\nTo be held next month, Chalmers flagged in a Press Club speech that the roundtable could pave the way for a much-needed overhaul of the tax system \ufeff\u2013 a speech that was quite quickly followed by calls to reform the GST.\n\nJim Chalmers said the government's productivity roundtable could lead to tax overhaul. (Rohan Thomson)\n\nHow does Australia's GST compare to the rest of the world?\n\nWhile there's a perception among Australians that ours is a high-taxing nation, the truth is taxes here are quite low compared to the rest of the world .\n\nThe GST is no exception.\n\nWhile the United States doesn't have a federal consumption tax (it instead has state-based sales taxes) and Canada has a lower rate of 5 per cent, Australia's 10 per cent GST is on the lower end of the global scale.\n\nIt's on par with the consumption taxes levelled in Japan and South Korea, but short of the GST in New Zealand (15 per cent) and of comparative value added taxes (VATs) in the likes of Germany (19 per cent), the United Kingdom (20 per cent) and Ireland (23 per cent).\n\nIt's also below the OECD average of 19.4 per cent.\n\nLittle surprise, then, that the amount of consumption tax Australia collects as a proportion of total revenue is far less than the global average.\n\nWhat could a change look like?\n\nExactly what a\ufeff reformed GST could look like differs from economist to economist, but a common suggestion has been raising it to 15 per cent.\n\nThat's what Holden's proposal is, while at the same time cutting personal income tax and giving every worker a $12,500 GST-free threshold to make sure low earners are better off.\n\nThe point about shielding low-income earners from any ill effects of a GST increase has been made by several economists.\n\n\ufeff\"The GST is one of the most effective ways to tax those on higher incomes, but it affects lower-income earners more,\" Dr Venkat Narayanan from RMIT University said.\n\n\"Why not talk about a 10.5 per cent GST for the next few years and increase it by 0.5 per cent until we get to 15, rather than just straight to a higher percentage?\n\n\"Any reform should consider income taxation... so that any increases to the GST do not disproportionately affect low-income earners.\"\n\nSome measures have been proposed to shield low-income earners from the negative effects of a GST overhaul. (Luis Enrique Ascui/The Age)\n\nAnother option flagged by think tank the Australia Institute, which has found the government has so far collected $231 billion less in GST than what was originally intended, is broadening the tax to remove some exemptions.\n\n\"Higher-income households don't have to pay GST on private schools and private health and can find other ways of avoiding the tax,\" executive director Richard Denniss said.\n\n\"On the other hand, lower-income households are spending more on rent and mortgages, which means they have less money to spend on the things that would generate GST revenue.\n\n\"If the Australian government wants to fill this tax blackhole without hurting low-income households, it could broaden the GST so that it applies to private school fees and private health insurance.\ufeff\"\n\nSo will the government actually increase the GST\ufeff?\n\nProbably not.\n\n\"I think often an increase in the GST is spent three or four times over by the time people are finished with all of the things that they want to do with it,\" Chalmers said when taking questions following his Press Club address.\n\nAnd while the treasurer also called \ufeffto an end to what he called the \"rule-in, rule-out game\", Prime Minister Anthony Albanese couldn't help himself last week.\n\n\"Consumption taxes by definition are regressive in their nature, so that's something that doesn't fit with the agenda,\" he said.",

        "text": "Farmers and researchers hope the birth of a new generation of hardier, more heat-resistant cattle on a West Australian farm will spur the breed's adoption across the country.\n\nOriginally from Eastern Africa, Nguni cattle are bred to survive in tough landscapes, which advocates say makes them ideal for regional Australia.\n\nThe new herd was born on Whitby Falls Farm, run by Murdoch University south of Perth, to educate veterinary students and research the breed.\n\nMurdoch University animal reproduction expert and research lead Pete Irons said Nguni cattle had adapted over many centuries to harsh environments.\n\n\"They're very light on the land \u2026 they're very efficient at utilising resources \u2026 their ability to conserve nitrogen [and] recycle nitrogen in their bodies is all very highly developed,\" he said.\n\nCaitlin Cooper and Pete Irons say Nguni cattle are a hardy breed. (ABC South West WA: Kate Forrester)\n\nThe cattle's skin contains an oily substance that reflects the sun's rays, and they are also able to regulate their body temperature very effectively.\n\nDr Irons said these characteristics contributed to the breed's ability to tolerate tough conditions, making them a desirable livestock option in drought and heatwave-prone regions like WA.\n\n\"[They're also] highly disease resistant and very fertile,\" he said.\n\n\"So despite being in very harsh environments, they're able to breed and reproduce very successfully.\"\n\nNguni produce less methane than other breeds. (ABC South West WA: Kate Forrester)\n\n'Eco-friendly' alternative\n\nNguni breeder Ed Rous said they produced less methane than other breeds, and were the best cattle for any sustainable farming operation.\n\nEd Rous breeds Ngunis on his farm in Gundaroo. (Supplied: Ed Rous)\n\nThe red-meat industry recently abandoned its target of net-zero emissions by 2030, claiming the goal was not possible.\n\nHowever, Dr Irons said the beef industry needed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, and the Nguni offered an environmentally friendly step in the right direction.\n\n\"Anything we can do to address [those emissions] by creatively using different breeds of animals with unique genetics like this and farming efficiently \u2026 that will, by its very nature, reduce methane emissions,\" he said.\n\n\"This breed has real advantages here in Western Australia that the farming community should take seriously, especially as we move more and more into drought conditions [and] resource constraints.\n\n\"We think it's a breed we should be looking at.\"\n\nMurdoch's Whitby Falls Farm school is a 45-minute drive south of Perth. (ABC South West WA: Kate Forrester)\n\nRaising awareness of the breed\n\nMr Rous said while interest in breeding Nguni cattle had been growing, the market remained focused on larger breeds such as Angus and Hereford.\n\n\"I feel the place in the sun for the Nguni is definitely more sustainable operations where people are farming paddock to plate because of their good meat \u2026 you can value-add by selling the product directly yourself,\" he said.\n\nEd Rous describes Nguni cattle as God's given breed. (Supplied: Ed Rous)\n\nMr Rous said he hoped research, like the studies being done by Murdoch University, would raise awareness about the breed.\n\n\"I have no doubt that they are capable of doing exceptionally well and they've proven to me that they [can], but I'm hoping we get more and more Australians interested in them,\" he said.\n\n\" Show people through scientific research that they are God's given breed of cattle to cattlemen. \"\n\nMurdoch student vet Caitlin Cooper said she expected the breed to have a \"huge impact\" moving forward.\n\n\"They truly are [the ultimate survivors] \u2026 they're tick resistant, heat resistant and in this current climate we need a resistant breed,\" she said.\n\n\"It's just about getting the word out about the Ngunis because I think that's the way into the future.\"",

        "text": "How far do you have to go to get your grocery shop done?\n\nProbably not 10 hours, which was the trip residents of Burringurrah, 1,000km north of Perth, had to do until this year.\n\nBut the opening of a community store has addressed more issues than empty fridges and long commutes \u2014 attendance at the local school has improved greatly.\n\n\"It was because families weren't going into Carnarvon and doing a food shop,\" Burringurrah Remote Community School principal Samantha Dalton said.\n\n\"They were able to do a food shop here.\"\n\nShelves of food are only steps away from locals rather than hours. (ABC Pilbara: Lina Elsaadi)\n\nAttendance problems\n\nFamilies were often out of town for weeks at a time, taking their children with them, Ms Dalton said. The absences would add up to months in a year.\n\n\"Sometimes they spend all their money and then they have to wait another payday to get diesel to come back to community,\" she said.\n\n\"Then they've probably eaten all of that food so then they need to go and do a food shop again.\n\n\" It's a bit of a cycle. \"\n\nChildren have attended school more frequently since the shop opened. (ABC Pilbara: Lina Elsaadi)\n\nMount Augustus Tourist Park hosts a small corner shop 40km from the community, but Ms Dalton said it was not an option for most.\n\n\"It's pretty expensive and you wouldn't want to do your weekly shopping there,\" she said.\n\n\"You just couldn't afford it.\"\n\nSamantha Dalton is the principal of the Burringurrah Remote Community School. (ABC Pilbara: Lina Elsaadi)\n\nThe sailor's disease\n\nSchool staff member Glenda Sibson said having fresh produce in town might have reduced a disease many would expect to have been left in the past \u2014 scurvy.\n\n\"You can see the difference,\" she said.\n\nNot eating enough fruits and vegetables can cause nutritional deficiencies. Ms Sibson said the previous lack of available produce meant the primary lifestyle was hunting.\n\nGlenda Sibson has been working at the school for four years. (ABC Pilbara: Lina Elsaadi)\n\n\"Although traditionally Aboriginal people were hunting for seeds and bush tucker \u2026 that can be quite labour intensive, so the meals were predominantly meat-based,\" she said.\n\n\"This causes issues because the kids get boils and scurvy.\"\n\nThe accessibility of fresh fruit and vegetables improved health in the community. (ABC Pilbara: Lina Elsaadi)\n\nFood security used to be front of mind for many as well, but Ms Sibson said the presence of a local store helped ease that \u2014 which she noticed in her students.\n\n\"You can certainly see that people are more relaxed because they know that there is a next meal.\"\n\nThe shop opening would make lasting impacts on the community and the lives of the children, she added.\n\n\" Everybody talks about closing the gap, but that's not going to happen if kids aren't regularly attending school. \"\n\nA return to Burringurrah\n\nTracy Parsons first came to Burringurrah from New Zealand 16 years ago.\n\nBack then, the town had a small shop which she worked at. Eventually it closed and she went to other WA communities.\n\nShe heard in January the shop was to open.\n\n\"I put my hand up to come back from New Zealand and see this lovely community,\" Ms Parsons said.\n\nOpen six days a week, the store is a one-stop shop. (ABC Pilbara: Lina Elsaadi)\n\nKeeping a shop in town was no easy feat but was worth it, she added.\n\n\"It's a huge effort by everyone involved to keep this door open and to keep it viable.\n\n\" It's really nice to get up and see people smiling because they know that they're OK. \"\n\nTracy Parsons says she loved her time in Burringurrah 16 years ago. (ABC Pilbara: Lina Elsaadi)\n\nMs Parsons has used the shop to broaden the horizons of the children as well.\n\n\"We just had one of our young high school girls come over \u2026 she wanted to do some work experience,\" she said.\n\n\"She came over during school time on Friday and it's just teaching her basic things.\n\n\"I do think it's important, especially for our high school kids, to realise that outside of our beautiful community there's another world they can be a part of.\"",

        "text": "In the country Victorian town of Hamilton, nearly 300 kilometres west of Melbourne, a group of men meet in their local pub once a month to talk about the latest novel they are reading.\n\nFarmer Jack Kennedy, who formed the Hamilton branch of the Tough Guy Book Club nearly five years ago, grew up feeling like it was not normal for men to read books.\n\n\"[Fiction] is a great way to build empathy in men, when they're reading through someone else's eyes,\" Mr Kennedy said.\n\n\" It's a really important thing for men's mental health. \"\n\nBut according to data collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) that was published last year, Australians are reading less.\n\nThat was especially true for men.\n\nGender gap in reading\n\nTough Guy Book clubs were started by Melburnian Shay Leighton 13 years ago with the aim of getting men to \"read more, talk more, and have more friends\".\n\n\"It just really builds great connections among men,\" Mr Kennedy said, as a tractor hummed in the background.\n\n\"Which I think is something that we're really desperate for at the moment with a lot of the political things going on and the way that we currently interact socially with social media.\"\n\nBut growing up there was a social norm \"where you didn't want to be known as someone who reads books\", he said.\n\nThat is borne out by the ABS data, although it hints at a broader decline in reading, despite Aussies having more leisure time than ever before.\n\nThe population cohort that read the least was males aged 15\u201324, with only 10.1 per cent reading on any given day, according to the ABS.\n\nWhile Gen Z teenage girls and young women were not far ahead, the data showed females, on average, were reading more than males across all age groups.\n\nNearly one in four Generation X females (23 per cent) participated in reading compared to about one in eight Generation X males (12 per cent).\n\nAnna Burkey, president of book industry initiative Australia Reads, which aims to get more people reading, said part of the problem was boys and men did not see themselves reflected in the reading world.\n\nAnna Burkey says the gender gap in reading comes from men not seeing themselves as readers. (Supplied: Anna Burkey)\n\n\"If you see people around you regularly doing something, you want to do it,\" Ms Burkey said.\n\n\" If you see fewer men and boys [reading] then you think to yourself, 'Well, maybe that's not for me because I do not see myself reflected.' \"\n\nAccording to Ms Burkey, 29 per cent of Australian senior school students did not read or listen to a book at all in the previous 12 months, a 7 per cent increase on a previous study.\n\nAustralia Reads says well-funded school libraries are part of the solution to get younger people reading more. (ABC News: Rebecca Carmody)\n\n\"We're not just seeing people not reading for themselves \u2026 we're seeing people not reading to their children as much and that they are less likely to read to boys than to girls,\" she said.\n\n\"So this pattern is being reinforced very unconsciously.\"\n\nMs Burkey said she would like to see more dads reading to their children to set a positive example.\n\nWorrying decline\n\nAward-winning Victorian author Jock Serong said being read to as a child made an impact.\n\nJock Serong says some days he feels his profession is heading towards extinction.

        "text": "England has dismissed four Indian batters and given the Lord's Test another twist of fate to leave it on a knife-edge heading toward the fifth and final day.\n\nIndia set itself a winning target of 193 runs but was reduced to 4-58 in its second innings overnight. Stumps, with eight overs remaining, came as a relief to India, with England fired up and a sun-soaked Lord's crowd turned happily hostile.\n\nFor one of the teams to take a 2-1 lead in the five-match series, England needs six more wickets or India needs 135 more runs.\n\nAsked for a prediction, India's Washington Sundar smiled and said his team was in the box seat to claim the win.\n\n\"Definitely India winning tomorrow. Just after lunch,\" he said.\n\n\"The position we are in right now, we would have taken. Maybe one down would be ideal.\"\n\nOpening batter Lokesh Rahul will resume on 33 not out but with the ball only 17.4 overs old and still juicy.\n\nIndia began its chase after tea and appeared to weather the early storm after Yashasvi Jaiswal fell to Jofra Archer for a duck and fellow opener Rahul was dropped on five by Chris Woakes.\n\nRahul and Karun Nair piled more hurt on England and were chipping runs off the target until nearly an hour later when Nair left a straight delivery from seamer Brydon Carse and was plumb LBW.\n\nIndia appeared to panic. In came captain Shubman Gill, the series' most prolific batter. But he was unusually anxious, played six false shots in the nine balls he faced, and was out LBW to Carse for six.\n\nThat huge wicket sent England into orbit and Carse into overdrive.\n\nIndia sent in fast bowler Akash Deep as a nightwatchman and for the last 15 minutes of the day he was targeted. Deep survived a video review on umpire's call and multiple LBW and catch appeals off Carse. But it was Stokes who smashed his off stump in what turned out to be the last ball of a remarkable day.\n\nThe inspired Carse had 2-11 and Stokes 1-15.\n\nIn all, 14 wickets fell on day four.\n\n\"When the ball gets a little bit softer, there are more runs to be had out there, but if you get it enough in the right place [the pitch is] very tricky,\" England batting coach Marcus Trescothick told the BBC.\n\n\"It'll come down to who holds the pressure best tomorrow.\"\n\nEngland was fielding on days two and three and gave its bowlers only 61 overs of rest before it was bowling again on day four.\n\nEngland was batting at 4-154 in the afternoon session and looking good to post a challenging target but it suffered a collapse of 6-38 to be all out for 192.\n\nFor some reason, the pitch turned nasty overnight. It was offering plenty for the new-ball seamers and India's Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj made deliveries fly off a length and rear up almost dangerously. On this minefield, four England batters blew up in the morning.\n\nBen Duckett swatted straight to mid-on and Siraj followed through by screaming \"come on\" twice in Duckett's face and they brushed shoulders. Siraj got Ollie Pope next, LBW for four after a review.\n\nZak Crawley's brave but skittish innings finished on 22, edging a drive at Nitish Kumar Reddy.\n\nHarry Brook relieved the tension by scooping Deep for two boundaries and smashing him into the members' pavilion. But Brook then tried sweeping the seamer and was bowled around his pads on 23.\n\nCan't get enough cricket from Grandstand? Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.\n\nJoe Root and Stokes took England to lunch on 4-98 and spent the afternoon edging their team toward a defendable target; 250 in the mind of most observers.\n\nThe pitch eased as the ball softened and Root and Stokes took England past 100 and 150.\n\nThen off-spinner Sundar regained the momentum for India when he found drift and spin and bowled Root on 40 (sweeping), Jamie Smith on 8 (defending), Stokes on 33 (sweeping) and Shoaib Bashir on 0 (defending).\n\nSundar had 4-22 in 12.1 overs, the best figures by an India spinner in England in 23 years.\n\nBumrah took 2-38 and Siraj 2-31.\n\n\"They were all big wickets, especially [at] the stage of play,\" Sundar said.\n\n\"The UK has been kind. I don't get as much drift in subcontinent conditions.\"\n\nA dozen England batters in the match were bowled, the most by England in a Test since 1887 in Sydney. It had never happened in England. Six of the bowleds in the match were by Bumrah. That was a first for India against England. The last bowler to bowl six Englishmen was Curtly Ambrose in 1994 at Port of Spain.\n\nBut India's terrific bowling effort showed England what kind of damage it can do, too, and set up the match for a thrilling finale at a sold-out Lords.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

Robert Sanchez, meanwhile, saved six shots in his best showing of the tournament.\n\nChelsea, who won the 2021 Club World Cup that featured only eight teams, battled past Portugal's Benfica and Brazilian sides Palmeiras and Fluminense in the knockouts to face Paris Saint-Germain \u2014 six weeks removed from their first UEFA Champions League trophy.\n\nPSG's goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma had allowed just one goal in their first six matches of the Cup.\n\nThe frustrated Parisians went down to 10 men in the 85th minute when Joao Neves pulled Chelsea defender Marc Cucurella by the hair, was caught on video review and shown red.\n\nAltercations spilled past the final whistle, and PSG coach Luis Enrique appeared to grab at Pedro's neck while he and Donnarumma confronted Chelsea players.\n\nUS President Donald Trump presented the trophy to Chelsea after the match, and the player of the tournament award to Palmer, before finding himself caught up in the celebrations.\n\nUS President Donald Trump reacts as FIFA boss Gianni Infantino speaks to him after presenting Chelsea with the trophy. (Getty Images: Chris Brunskill/Fantasista)\n\nThe Chelsea players appeared bemused as Trump remained on the stage after the presentation, as FIFA boss Gianni Infantino motioned for the president to move out from the middle of the celebrations.\n\nTrump remained in place as the players briefly paused, before they lifted the trophy and Trump was guided out of the celebrations through the back of the pack.\n\nEarlier, Cucurella made a crucial stop to keep the game scoreless in the 16th minute. Fabian Ruiz made a great pass across the box to Desire Doue, who could have shot it but instead tried a centring pass to a teammate that Cucurella intercepted.\n\nSix minutes later, Palmer got the scoring started.\n\nMalo Gusto picked up a wayward header from PSG's Nuno Mendes and ran into the box. After creating space, his shot was blocked right back to his feet, so he fed Palmer for a left-footed finish into the bottom left corner.\n\nLevi Colwill earned the assist on the second goal for his long ball downfield to Palmer. From there, Palmer calmly dribbled toward the centre of the 18-yard box and fired the same low strike for an identical goal.\n\nIn the 43rd, Palmer tapped a pass between two defenders for Pedro, who popped his shot over a sprawling Donnarumma's right shoulder.\n\nReuters",

My main concern was just being able to compete again without pain.\"\n\nThe 24-year-old follows her compatriot Neve Bradbury, who also finished third in the 2024 event, and joins Amanda Spratt (third in 2018 and 2019), Kathy Watt (second in 1994 and 3rd in 1990) and Elisabeth Hepple (second in the inaugural 1988 event) in the Giro's Australian roll of honour.\n\nAfter taking the race lead off Marlen Reusser on the penultimate stage, Longo Borghini successfully defended the pink jersey on the final 134km stage eight from Forl\u00ec to Imola, finishing fourth behind her Swiss rival on the day.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nLongo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) ended up victorious by 18 seconds ahead of Movistar's Reusser, with Gigante unable to make any inroads into the champion's overnight lead of 71 seconds over the Melbourne rider.\n\nThe stage was won by Movistar's Liane Lippert, who beat Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime) in a two-up sprint at the famous Imola racetrack, the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari, after the pair had escaped from a group of a dozen riders, including Gigante, in the last 3km.\n\nThe hilly route provided Gigante's key to the Queen of the Mountains blue jersey prize. She had been one point behind Ostolaza overnight, but won the first mountain sprint in Monticino to regain a lead that she wasn't about to relinquish.\n\nLorena Wiebes (SD Worx-Protime) then went on a solo breakaway to win an intermediate sprint and seal her points classification victory.\n\n\"It's been an incredible Giro \u2014 for me and for the team.

        "text": "Table olives are among one of the most polarising foods \u2014 people either love them or hate them.\n\nA world-first processing method crafting an Australian-style table olive is aiming to change that, transforming the fruit's flavour while also reducing labour and water usage.\n\nJohn Fielke, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of South Australia, is behind the innovation set to revolutionise the table olive industry.\n\nHe is on a mission to change how people think about the complex fruit.\n\nThe Australian-style olives are processed differently and put into brine during harvest. (ABC Riverland: Will Hunter)\n\n\"With our process, we're not fermenting the olives, we're not degrading the oil that's in there, we're actually making olives that taste fruity,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Fielke said judges at table olive competitions he entered compared the tasting notes of his table olives to descriptors of what people would find \"on a fine bottle of wine\".\n\n\"The flavour comments [for the olives] are notes of passionfruit, citrus, berries,\" he said.\n\n\" The other one is [a taste of] musk \u2014 like those pink musk lollies. \"\n\nThe patented method coined \"Olives the Australian Way\" has also proven to be more sustainable and efficient, keeping the brine to cure the olives from start to finish.\n\nThe new flavours are described as fresh and fruity rather than salty and bitter. (ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)\n\nProcessing methods craft flavours\n\nFor olives to be edible, the fruit requires processing to remove its natural bitterness.\n\nDifferent curing methods, like lye treatment or natural fermentation in brine, then form part of producing the olives' distinct characteristics and flavour notes.\n\nSpanish, Greek and Californian-style olives are the most common produced on a commercial scale, but their processing methods are time- and labour-intensive, known for their high water usage and wastewater disposal requirement.\n\nKalamata olives are among the well-known Greek-style olives produced commercially. (ABC News: Andrew Ware)\n\nProfessor Fielke's processing method relies on chemistry to capture the fruit's bitter compounds in the brine and filtration systems recirculating it.\n\n\"We are putting our olives in the brine in the orchard. [We] keep that brine clear through to our finished pack-out, and repack our brine with our olives.\n\n\" It's a huge saving in water and cost and the time to do it in. \"\n\nProfessor Fielke relies on chemistry and a filtering system to debitter the olives. (ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)\n\nIndustry data shows most table olives sold in Australia are imported, with only 3,000 tonnes produced domestically.\n\nAustralian Olive Association chief executive Michael Southan sees large economic opportunities in the innovation to shift the country's industry.\n\n\"It will not only grow the production of locally produced table olives, but it's a technology that will be able to be used around the world. It has huge potential.\"\n\nThe new processing method is expected to ramp up table olive production in Australia. (ABC News: Michael Coggan)\n\nCutting labour costs and waste\n\nThe table olive processing innovation is a lifeline for farmers like George Kratopoulos, who has been battling low return prices and high labour costs.\n\nHe now regrets reducing his Taylorville family grove in South Australia from the initial 14,000 trees his father planted in the 1970s to 3,000 trees today.\n\n\"We've gone from basically wanting to step back out of the industry to expanding ourselves,\" Mr Kratopoulos said.\n\nGeorge Kratopoulos checks hand-picked olives destined for market. (ABC Riverland: Will Hunter)\n\nAs olives bruise easily, he previously had about 20 workers hand-picking each table olive to be sent to produce markets in Sydney and Brisbane.\n\nThe new method gives Mr Kratopoulos the opportunity to machine-harvest his crop, making the process more efficient.\n\n\"It's going to be a lot cheaper, there'll be not much labour costs and it's a win-win on both sides,\" he said.\n\nMr Kratopoulos machine-harvests his crop to be processed under the new method. (ABC Riverland: Will Hunter)\n\nHarvesting the crop straight into brine also cuts his on-farm food waste.\n\n\"Once we've shaken the fruit, if there's any damage, it stops the deterioration automatically, whereas in fresh markets that bruising will show and we'll have to take it out and there is a lot of wastage,\" Mr Kratopoulos said.\n\nHe described the new processing method as a \"game-changer\", giving him hope for a brighter future in the industry.\n\n\" I've gone from looking at trying to get ourselves out of the industry and retiring my parents, to the fact, hang on, there's good things on the horizon. \"\n\nThe innovation gives Mr Kratopoulos hope for the future. (ABC Riverland: Will Hunter)\n\nNot enough olives to scale up\n\nSupported by an Australian Economic Accelerator Seed grant, the innovation aims to raise the country's table olive production 30-fold to 100,000 tonnes in the next 10 to 15 years.\n\nThe project has reached semi-commercial scale and proven it has plated up fresh debittered olives to consumers quicker.\n\nProfessor Fielke processed 82 tonnes of table olives this season. (ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)\n\n\"We can get edible olives ready for the market within five months from harvest,\" Professor Fielke said.\n\n\"That is more than halving the traditional time taken from the farm to the market.\"\n\nSue Fielke sorts and packs table olives at the processing facility in South Australia. (ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)\n\nHe and his wife, Sue Fielke, processed 82 tonnes of table olives this season, with the aim to triple the intake next year.\n\nDespite the opportunities the innovation offers, there are major challenges to scaling up because not enough table olives are grown in Australia, according to Mr Southan.\n\n\"We really need to see more production of olives, and that's both from a productivity point of view, so getting more olives off each tree, and we need more trees,\" he said.\n\nMichael Southan says more tree plantings and table olives are needed for the project to expand.

        "text": "It will take years before their commitments to increase their own defence spending might wean them off their reliance on the US for protection from an aggressively expansionist Russia. However, with Trump also announcing at the weekend that he is considering raising the baseline tariff rate to 15 to 20 per cent, they have to take his threat of a 30 per cent tariff \u2013 and additional tariffs to match any retaliatory measures they might take \u2013 seriously. Trump appears impatient that he hasn\u2019t delivered the \u201c90 deals in 90 days\u201d the administration boasted it would deliver, let alone the 200 deals he once said were virtually done. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. EU and US trade officials have been negotiating for months. Credit: Bloomberg He\u2019s also been boosted by the successful passage through Congress of his One Big Beautiful Bill Act and by the buoyancy of US financial markets, which have rebounded from their sell-offs in April, when Trump first unveiled his \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.\n\nIn April, he deferred imposition of the tariffs until July (and subsequently deferred them again until next month) because the bond market was \u201cgetting a little queasy.\u201d Now markets have settled, with the sharemarket posting record highs. That may be because investors don\u2019t believe he will follow through with the reciprocal tariffs he has threatened \u2013 the \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out\u201d or TACO trade \u2013 or because any ill effects from tariffs, most notably increased inflation, have yet to show up in economic data. Loading No one, including Trump himself, it seems, knows what he might post next on his Truth Social, so markets are behaving as if nothing has happened until something actually happens. August 1 \u2013 the new deadline for his reciprocal tariffs \u2013 could be a wake-up moment for markets. The apparent complacency in markets, in the meantime, is encouraging Trump to be more aggressive and more impatient.\n\nThere is a risk that, rather than heed, as he has until now, the urgings of calmer voices in his cabinet to negotiate deals, he will follow his personal preference and unilaterally present trade partners with \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d ultimatums. While the EU still appears to believe that Trump\u2019s latest threat is a negotiating ploy, they have prepared countermeasures in case it isn\u2019t. The EU had drawn up a list of US exports that it could target in response to the baseline tariff and the sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminium and autos, covering about \u20ac21 billion ($37 billion) of US exports. Items on that list included chicken, motorcycles and clothing. It has another list, targeting another \u20ac72 billion of products, ranging from aircraft to alcohol, with which it could respond to Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs. It also has what it calls its \u201canti-coercion instrument,\u201d or actions that could hit the trade in services, although it is reluctant to deploy that instrument, which it devised in response to a deluge of cheap imports from China.\n\nThe total trade between the US and EU is worth about $US1 trillion ($1.5 trillion), with the EU enjoying a trade surplus in goods of $US235 billion, but a trade deficit in services of about $US75 billion. The EU, in its negotiations with the US, had sought exemptions from Trump\u2019s tariffs for key sectors, such as aircraft and alcohol, in exchange for a promise to buy more US goods, particularly weapons and LNG, that would narrow the US goods trade deficit. Von der Leyen said on Saturday that the EU was ready to continue negotiating but prepared to consider retaliation. Imposing 30 per cent tariffs on EU exports would disrupt essential transatlantic supply chains, harming businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic, she said. The dilemma for the EU is that Trump\u2019s view of its non-tariff policies and trade barriers includes its value-added tax and its regulation of digital activity to protect competition and consumers. No nation state \u2013 or, in the EU\u2019s case, collection of 27 nation states \u2013 would surrender its sovereignty and allow Trump to dictate its domestic policy settings. Having seen what Trump has done to Brazil, threatening a 50 per cent tariff rate in response to unfair trade barriers (even though the US has a trade surplus with Brazil) and its trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 an enthusiastic Trump supporter \u2013 for allegedly plotting a coup, the EU would be conscious of the risk that Trump\u2019s demands may not be confined to its goods trade.\n\nThe potential for a trade confrontation is, therefore, quite significant. The EU will have to decide whether it should roll over and accede to Trump\u2019s demands, damaging its industries and the sovereignty of its states. Alternatively, it could emulate China and allow the confrontation to escalate to the point where it threatens a trade embargo, which would, as China\u2019s tot-for-tat tariffs did, scare the bejesus out of financial market participants and unnerve the White House. Loading Trump\u2019s indiscriminate threats of trade sanctions against America\u2019s friends and foes alike have ignited a scramble by the EU and others to secure new markets. There is potential for a new trading bloc, spanning Europe, the non-Chinese Asia Pacific and Latin America, to emerge. Trump and much of his hand-picked cabinet are protectionists and isolationists. At the conclusion of his trade wars on everyone, if much of the rest of the world decides to trade freely among themselves, he might get what he wished for.",

        "text": "This is, to the best of this masthead\u2019s knowledge (and that of Australian soccer stats guru Andrew Howe; if he doesn\u2019t know something, it\u2019s not worth knowing), the first time a team that just been promoted from League One - England\u2019s third tier - has toured Australia. Wrexham\u2019s suddenly global appeal is the reason why it is happening; commercially and logistically, it just wouldn\u2019t make sense for any other teams to come out here. Usually, it\u2019s just Premier League clubs who turn up, cash in, have a little run around and sell some jerseys. Twice in recent memory - Leeds United (2019) and Wolverhampton Wanderers (2009) - have promoted teams from the Championship come here ahead of their return campaigns in the Premier League. But no lower. In that respect, there is some genuine intrigue about Wrexham AFC vs Sydney FC, a showdown that nobody would have dreamed of before the Reynolds-McElhenney revolution. The Sky Blues had a bit of a stinker in the A-League last season, somehow missing the top six despite boasting a star-studded squad. But most seasons, they would be considered one of the country\u2019s top teams. So are how much better are Wrexham, who finished second in League One, than the Sky Blues? \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d Sydney FC\u2019s Joe Lolley says.\n\nThere is probably no player better qualified to make a pre-match assessment than Lolley. His career began with Kidderminster Harriers in the Conference (now called the National League), or the fifth tier of English football. But he has also played in the Premier League with Huddersfield Town, in the Championship with them and Nottingham Forest, and, briefly, in League One when he was on loan at Scunthorpe United. That means he has taken the field in four of England\u2019s top five divisions; though he has played cup matches against teams from League Two, the only one he hasn\u2019t played in. He has also played against Wrexham - way back in 2013, three years before the first Deadpool movie came out, when Lolley was with Kidderminster, scoring twice in a 3-1 home win. Few in Australia are better placed to make this assessment than Joe Lolley. Credit: Getty Images Lolley reckons A-League teams compare favourably to those in the Championship and below when it comes to technique; like most Englishmen who come here to play, he was initially surprised by the extent of the local technical skill when he arrived. There are two major differences, he believes. First: physicality.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s a bit of a beast in England when it comes physicality, defensively and off the ball and those sort of things,\u201d he said. Not so much in the A-League. Secondly: squad depth, which is crucial in a gruelling 46-game season. When he was in the Championship, Lolley recalls most teams having about 20-odd players of approximately the same level, competing for starting spots, and the difference between the best and the worst in the division was not huge. The A-League, in contrast, is a lot more \u201cspread out\u201d, and the impact of losing two or three key players can be enormous. There are individuals in Australia who could arguably hold their own in the Premier League, he said, but then some who would probably be better suited to non-league. That\u2019s not being harsh; that\u2019s just the nature of A-League squads, most of which are backfilled by unproven scholarship players and journeymen, and a time when clubs are strapped for cash. But, hypothetically, where would the best teams he\u2019s seen or been part of in Australia wash up in England, on the basis of quality in the starting XI? \u201cProbably the lower end of the Championship,\u201d Lolley says.",

De Minaur tested Novak Djokovic in a high-quality fourth-round contest at Wimbledon. Credit: Getty Images Woodbridge spoke with a still-disappointed de Minaur in the hours after his four-set defeat to Djokovic. De Minaur\u2019s serve was among the topics. \u201cAlex was playing against a guy [Djokovic] who has adjusted his serve throughout his career and made it better \u2013 and that\u2019s the example you have to look at,\u201d Woodbridge said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great team of people around him, got all the technology, and now it\u2019s time to go back and keep tweaking the technique.\n\nLoading \u201cHe\u2019s got to rotate his shoulders, get his right shoulder back, and get more turn and torque. What he does is take the racquet head out to the right, and that opens him up, and he gets too front-on. \u201cThat [results in] lack of control and trajectory. The best players have great shoulder rotation, hold it in there, and then they uncoil.\u201d Respected Australian coach Craig O\u2019Shannessy made the same observation about de Minaur\u2019s front-on service motion, and said fixing that was not about adding more power but instead would add much-needed serving accuracy. ATP Tour serving analysis last year of the top-20 men\u2019s players found that de Minaur was by far the least accurate in that group, based on placement in the service box.\n\nThat continued at Wimbledon this year, where the Australian\u2019s serves went to the body, rather than the corners, about five times more often than Djokovic and Jannik Sinner. O\u2019Shannessy, who previously worked with Djokovic, said that was an accuracy issue for de Minaur and not a deliberate strategy. The key serve numbers for Alex de Minaur at Wimbledon. Credit: Wimbledon website / IBM \u201cAlex is hitting it in the strike zone [too often] \u2026 he\u2019s losing so many points because the opponent is ready for that,\u201d O\u2019Shannessy told this masthead. \u201cFrom a placement perspective, Novak is serving only [about] three per cent at the body, and everything else is an even mix, so it makes it almost impossible to do a game plan against him.\n\n\u201cAlex has to improve his technique. He has to stay sideways longer. The lower body\u2019s got to rotate and stop, and the upper body then receives that energy and throws that into the arm. He\u2019s over-rotating with [both], and then he\u2019s too front-on.\u201d Djokovic boasts remarkable serving accuracy in 2025 and at this Wimbledon. Almost half Djokovic\u2019s serves on the deuce and advantage sides landed wide or down the T, compared to between two and four per cent to the body, according to IBM tracking data. De Minaur, on the other hand, had about 50 per cent down the T on each side at Wimbledon, but went wide on only 28 and 36 per cent of serves, respectively, on the advantage and deuce sides.\n\nLoading He was at 20 and 17 per cent to the body on the advantage and deuce sides, respectively. Interestingly, Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s percentage of serves to the body this event is even higher than de Minaur. However, Woodbridge said de Minaur should not beat himself up about the Djokovic defeat or become too preoccupied with his serving deficiencies. \u201cAlex is a legitimate top-10 player. The hardest part in this game is getting there, and then it\u2019s even harder to stay there \u2013 but he\u2019s proven he can do that,\u201d Woodbridge said. \u201cI said to him [post-match], \u2018Don\u2019t you dare tell me that you\u2019re not good enough to be in this space. You\u2019re 10 times better a tennis player than I ever was, and a lot of us were, so take your strengths, keep them, and keep working on those small bits that can make you better\u2019.\u201d",

So everything that was important to Kngwarray is a part of her cultural connection to that country, is about her responsibilities to country. It is all about that body paint, that gestural mark that you actually paint when you're doing ceremony. So when you're looking at Kngwarray's paintings, they are just this total connection to who she is as an Anmatyerr woman.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFive years in the making, the exhibition is the first major solo exhibition for an Indigenous Australian artist at the Tate.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribed as one of Australia's preeminent artists, Emily Kam Kngwarray is one of the most celebrated artists of the 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer works include paintings, textiles, and works on paper, and draw their inspiration from a deep connection to Country and cultural traditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving travelled to Kngwarray\u2019s community upwards of twelve times over the years, Kelli Cole says working with community was central to the curatorial process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So when I talk about her cultural responsibilities, Kngwarray was a senior elder of her community, so she actually had to partake in ceremony. And so what that meant was they would go on country, they would paint themselves up, they would sing a song. That song had a specific song for each ceremony that she did. And with her gestural marks within her batiks and her paintings actually come from that extraordinary knowledge that she had. So prior to painting, she had been doing that for such a long time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exhibition includes 83 pieces, some of which have never been shown in public before and have come from private collections from across Europe and America.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Emily Kam Kngwarray is well known in the Australian art world, her works are less recognised in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\nKelli Cole says by being on display somewhere like the Tate Modern, the works will gain even wider acclaim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Look, her impact in Australia is huge. Kngwarray's had several solo exhibitions in Australia and in Japan. So she's a name that is very well known in Australia as a major, major artist. By bringing her works here to the Tate Modern, we are hoping that her name is going to be synonymous with the European sort of vocabulary. It's gonna be Emily Kam Kngwarray, Jackson Pollock, all of these Picassos. We're really hoping that we can actually put her on the world scale or the world stage and people will start knowing her works.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exhibition opened last week and runs until January 11th 2026 at the Tate Modern gallery in London.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidered part of a wider shift to showcase artists previously left out of the spotlight, Art critic Tabish Khan says it is a historic moment for the gallery.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Key Points Murujuga, a peninsula in north-west WA near Karratha, contains the world's largest collection of rock art engravings.\n\nEnvironment Minister Murray Watt recently gave provisional approval to an extension of a nearby gas and oil project.\n\nThere are concerns the project could seriously degrade the Aboriginal rock art engravings.\n\nEnvironment Minister Murray Watt says the recent World Heritage listing of an ancient Indigenous rock art site will not influence the government's final decision about an extension of a contested gas project in the area.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) listed the Murujuga rock art landscape in Western Australia as a heritage site over the weekend, following lobbying by the federal government.\n\n\n\n\n\nMurujuga, a peninsula in north-west WA near Karratha, contains the world's largest collection of rock art engravings, known as petroglyphs, with some of its one million pieces estimated to be more than 50,000 years old.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also home to two gas plants, a fertiliser plant and iron ore and salt export facilities. In May, Watt gave conditional approval to an extension of oil and gas production company Woodside's North West Shelf project to 2070.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE This activist says she will continue legal challenge as Woodside gas extension approved\n\nThe project, Australia's largest gas and oil development, includes Woodside's Karratha Gas Plant, adjacent to Murujuga on the Burrup peninsula.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are concerns that the project's continuation and subsequent pollution will cause significant damage to Indigenous rock art in the area.\n\n\n\n'Industry can coexist with rock art', Watt says\n\nOn Monday, when asked if the site's World Heritage listing could influence the final decision on the Woodside extension, Watt said it wouldn't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No, it won't apply to any decisions that are currently underway or that have happened previously\", Watt told ABC's RN Breakfast radio program.\n\n\n\nMurujuga contains the world's largest collection of rock art engravings, known as petroglyphs. Source: Supplied / Save Our Songlines The environment minister said the decision meant any future development in the precinct would need to comply with World Heritage rules. He also said that it was clear \"industry can coexist with rock art\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I said that we would be applying strict conditions, and preservation of the rock art was central to my decision [to provisionally approve the North West Shelf extension] when I made that a few weeks ago,\" Watt told ABC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But I guess this is also a way of keeping future governments and future industry honest, to make sure that it does have this extra layer of protection against any inappropriate development in the future.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWatt visited UNESCO'S headquarters in Paris ahead of the listing, saying it would ensure stronger legal protections for the more than a million pieces of rock art.\n\n\n\nThe site was previously put forward to UNESCO for listing in 2023, with the application referred back in May this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its decision to list Murujuga, UNESCO recommended that both state and federal government address concerns that nearby acid emissions \u2014 including from Woodside's Burrup gas hub \u2014 were degrading the art.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it stopped short of implementing recommendations by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) \u2014 an advisory body which offers guidance to UNESCO on heritage sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe association had recommended that the World Heritage listing be deferred until Australia detailed how it would eliminate \"harmful acidic emissions that currently affect the petroglyphs\".\n\n\n\nThere are concerns that nearby acid emissions are degrading the rock art at Murujuga. Source: Supplied / Save Our Songlines The government responded by saying the recommendation was driven by \"factual inaccuracies\", and successfully argued concerns would be met and that Murujuga should be heritage-listed immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\nMardathoonera woman and Murujuga traditional custodian Raelene Cooper, who was at the UNESCO meeting, welcomed the World Heritage listing but criticised the removal of recommended protections, including halting industry expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today, Australia rewrote the World Heritage listing in the interests of the gas industry,\" she said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Save our Songlines: Custodian launches legal action to protect rock art from North West Shelf project\n\n\"Global scrutiny will now be applied to what is happening at Murujuga,\" Cooper said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You cannot have industry and culture coexist. It's never happened. It never works.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShortly after Watt granted provisional approval to the North West Shelf extension, Cooper launched legal action to try and protect the site.\n\n\n\nMardathoonera woman and Murujuga traditional custodian Raelene Cooper said Australia had rewritten the World Heritage listing in the interests of the gas industry. Source: AAP / Dan Himbrechts The Greens welcomed Murujuga's World Heritage listing on Friday but warned that the world was watching and urged Watt to reconsider the draft approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"UNESCO had warned that Woodside's gas plant threatened the longevity of the rock art prior to the listing, but Minister Watt successfully lobbied other nations when he should have simply rejected Woodside's climate bomb extension in the first place,\" Greens leader Larissa Waters said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nomination process was driven by the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation (MAC) on behalf of Traditional Owners the Ngarda-Ngarli.\n\n\n\n\n\nMAC chair Peter Hicks said on Friday it had been an \"Indigenous-led process\" in partnership with state and federal governments, thanking them for undertaking their roles \"without undermining Indigenous decision-making within the process\".\n\n\n\nCould industrial pollution damage rock art?\n\nLast month, a study out of Germany's Bonn University said the industrial emissions from the facilities cause lower pH and higher acid levels in the local rainwater and on the rock surfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The rock varnish on petroglyph-bearing rocks from Murujuga is highly likely impacted by local industrial pollution, with weathering rates most likely already accelerated due to the lower pH of the rainwater,\" the study said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

That's jobs for Australians, particularly in regional communities. The agreement that was signed today will focus on growing these tourism numbers back to our 2019 record of 1.4 million and beyond.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid the positive rhetoric around Sino-Australian relations, Mr Albanese did his best to dodge the US-sized elephant in the room.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia and the United States have just begun joint military exercises in Queensland, alongside over a dozen other allies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to Talisman Sabre 2025.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, there's been tensions - not so much around the Chinese ships that Acting Defence Minister Pat Conroy has acknowledged to the ABC's Insiders programme are monitoring the military exercises offshore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It would be unusual for them not to observe it. And we'll adjust accordingly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's more around comments by US defence strategist Elbridge Colby - who is running the US' review into the AUKUS pact.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has already been pressure for Australia to increase its defence spending - and Colby has reportedly pushed Australia and Japan to clarify what role they would play in a potential conflict with China over Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of the biggest economies in our alliance network really aren't pulling their weight... In some sense perhaps our closest ally in the world - they've been with us even in our less advisable wars, is the way I put it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in Australia, Pat Conroy has said Australia won't automatically follow the US into a future conflict, or pre-commit its troops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't disclose confidential discussions, but I make a couple of broad points. One, we don't engage in hypotheticals. We don't discuss hypotheticals. But secondly, the decision to commit Australian troops to a conflict will be made by the government of the day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PM himself has said nothing about Australia's position has changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's important that we have a consistent position, which Australia has had for a long period of time. We support the status quo when it comes to Taiwan. We don't support any unilateral action there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the Opposition has called for the Prime Minister to make the most of his visit to China.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PM faces a precarious task navigating Australia's complex relationship with its most important trading partner as his week-long visit begins in earnest.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter relations between China and Australia soured during the COVID-19 pandemic, Labor's election in 2022 precipitated a normalisation in trade and dialogue, with a return to regular high-level meetings.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut tensions remain fraught, with China's military assertiveness in the region an increasing concern for Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\nNationals Leader David Littleproud has told Channel 9 the trip is an opportunity the PM can't waste in balancing these issues.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the red rock hills of Murujuga in Western Australia's Pilbara region are a million ancient rock engravings.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the engravings date back 50,000 years, making them older than Stone Henge and the Pyramids of Giza.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ancient petroglyphs include the oldest known depiction of a human face, as well as engravings of plants and animals, some of which are now extinct.\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional owners have long campaigned to protect the art - and now, their bid for a UNESCO World Heritage listing has ended with triumph in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I therefore declare the decision 47-8B.13 adopted as amended.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUNESCO says their decision recognises that the site represents \u201ca masterpiece of human creative genius\u201d; is a unique testimony to a cultural tradition; and finally, that the site is an outstanding example of a cultural or human settlement showing interaction with the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nChair of the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation ((MAC)), Peter Hicks, travelled to Paris for the momentous decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Inscribed into the history books is a great, great outcome for us, the Aboriginal people. It's a nomination led by Aboriginal people, for Aboriginal people, and guided by the Aboriginal people. And therefore it is a world first.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Jeffries is also from the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation, which has led the campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says it's been years in the making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's been in motion now for two or three decades, and we've lost a lot of our old elders in the process. So this is also in recognition of their support, as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while the Corporation's campaign has gone on for decades, it wasn't until 2023 that the Australian Government nominated the Murujuga Cultural Landscape for World Heritage status.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's application was referred back to the government in May, after UNESCO suggested state and federal governments needed to do more to address concerns that acid emissions from Woodside's nearby gas project were damaging the engravings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe peninsula in northwest WA near Karratha is home to two gas plants, a fertiliser plant and iron ore and salt export facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Minister Senator Murray Watt argued those emission claims were based on inaccuracies, drawing on a report by about 50 scientists who said the emissions showed there was no ongoing risk to the engravings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the end, what persuaded the committee was the scientific evidence that was put forward which disputed some of the claims being made but also the genuine passion from the traditional owners to see this world heritage listing be secured.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Minister was also in Paris for the announcement, declaring the government was committed to protecting the site now and for future generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On behalf of the Australian government I am honoured to accept this inscription. Australia is thrilled with the committee's decision to inscribe the Murujuga's Cultural Landscape on the World Heritage List. This has been an Indigenous-led nomination and this victory belongs to the Ngarda-Ngarli, the traditional owners and custodians of Murujuga, whose deep knowledge and cultural leadership and enduring connection to country are at the heart of this inscription.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut concerns about the potential impacts of pollution on the rock art have not gone away with the listing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Conservation Foundation chief executive Kelly O'Shanassy says the world is watching now Murujuga is a world heritage site, and has urged the federal environment minister to reject Woodside's provisional gas project extension.\n\n\n\n\n\nConditions of the approval which relate to emissions from the plant are still being negotiated.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while the 21 member nations unanimously supported the UNESCO listing, they requested Australia continue to research the effects neighbouring industry has on the rock art, and report its findings to the U-N next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Woodside spokesperson has responded in a statement to SBS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The company has been a proud supporter of the World Heritage nomination and assessment process, and the company looks forward to continuing to work closely with the Murujuga Aboriginal Corporation and Traditional Custodians on the continued protection and management of this globally significant area.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, Mardathoonera woman and Murujuga traditional custodian Raelene Cooper says culture and industry cannot co-exist, and she remains worried about the long term impacts of emissions on the rock art.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Hicks says the Ngarda-Ngarli people will remain dedicated to protecting the site.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the weekday lunch rush and diners at 'Kitchen by Mike' - a popular restaurant in the Sydney CBD are among the first in the country to try a curious new cuisine.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcclaimed chef Mike McEnearney's much-loved sourdough bread is now being served with what's known as 'cultured Japanese quail spread.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So the cultured quail is folded through the butter. I would describe it as incredibly strong and mammy flavor with a texture of butter. So if you like strong chickeny quail flavors, it's in the texture of butter on bread., it's delicious, it's almost like p\u00e2t\u00e9.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what makes it so unique?\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, the quail meat in the butter did not come from a farm, rather it was produced in factory in the inner Sydney suburb of Alexandria - about a 20 minute drive from the restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\n'Cultured meat' is the process of taking a small amount of cells from an animal - in this case, a quail - and growing them in a factory-like setting to eventually produce a type of meat product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My first time in 35 years of cooking that I've seen a new category come to market. It's really exciting. It is brand new food.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the verdict from diners?\n\n\n\n\n\nDiner 1: \"Yeah I'd say it's pretty adventurous, Mike was mentioning it's pretty revolutionary. It's quite new in the industry so I'm glad to have tried it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDiner 2: \"P\u00e2t\u00e9, like a smokey p\u00e2t\u00e9. Really unusual taste but quite nice, I'd definitely have it again. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nDiner 3: \"I really like the innovative nature of it and I think I'd be really happy to see it more on menus.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom hatted restaurants to pubs, around a dozen restaurants across Australia have this week begun serving the cultured quail. About a dozen more will have it on their menu by the end of the month.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe product is the brainchild of Australian start-up Vow, which in June became the first company in the country to be given the greenlight to sell cultured meat.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt follows a more than two year approval process by the food safety regulator, F-S-A-N-Z.\n\n\n\n\n\nEllen DInsmoor, Vow's Chief Operating Officer, insists the company is not trying to replace meat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So what we make is very unique in that it's not plant-based, we're not trying to recreate beef and other meats we eat today. We're taking different cells from other animals, growing those and then using them to make new food products.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the quail cells are grown in a bioreactor, which is essentially a large stainless steel tank, similar to what you might see in a brewery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We take actual cells from animals and we grow them in what I think of as a nutrient broth, which is essentially recreating the conditions in which cells grow in our body or in an animal's body that has amino acids, salts, sugars. At the end of the day, you can harvest those cells out. Maybe imagine that if you're making cheese and you are taking some of the whey off the top, that's kind of what it looks like when you harvest the cells out. And then we can take those cells as a really beautiful, pure ingredient, really rich form of protein, another nutrient, some craft those into finished food products.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the product only made its debut in Australia this month, for the past year, it's been available in Singapore - the first country globally to approve the sale of cultured meat.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why produce food this way? Paul Wood, a Professor in Biotechnology at Monash University explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, for some people it's because they don't want to see animals harmed. For others, it's an environmental thing. They believe that this is going to be a more sustainable way of producing food. Some just say it's a new food experience. So there's a range of ways that it's being sort of marketed to people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he says, until the industry scales at large it remains unclear whether it will be more sustainable than farming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It will use less land. It's a factory. It'll probably use less water. But we know already that on an energy basis, it's unlikely to be more sustainable because it's quite an energy intensive process. So you really need to be using totally renewable energy. And even then, if you compared it to growing an animal in a paddock, it's still a hell of a lot more intensive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says cost is another challenge, and when it comes to nutrition:\n\n\n\n\"It's unlikely, I think, to be better than a piece of meat, a three dimensional with a lot of iron in there, a lot of vitamins, B12, et cetera. So we talk about meat being an energy dense or a nutritionally dense product, you're going to have to add back minerals and vitamins to this product. There's only one single cell type.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut others believe the industry has a role to play in addressing future food challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy some estimates, agricultural production will need to increase by around 60 percent by 2050 to meet the demands of the growing population.\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Perkins is the CEO of Cellular Agriculture Australia, a not-for-profit that seeks to advance cellular agriculture, which is the process of using cells to create products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We see cellular agriculture and the technologies that sit within it as a way of complimenting existing food supply chains and move towards a more future-proof food system where the technologies offer the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reduce land use and reduce water use, whilst also building resilience, particularly around things like climate shocks or supply chain disruptions and emerging threats like zoonotic diseases as we've seen recently through avian flu.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe technology is currently being harnessed to make everything from coffee to palm oil, leather and chocolate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut scaling the industry remains a challenge and calls for better investment come as countries take steps to ban sale and consumption of cultured food, Italy, France and some US states among them.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerns over quality and the threat to farmers are among the issues driving the pushback.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Italian farm lobby has labelled it \u2018Frankenstein meat.'\n\n\n\n\n\nPerkins says misconceptions around the concept of cultured meat are feeding 'unhelpful narratives.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One thing we hear a lot is references to things like lab-grown meat. Cell ag products aren't produced in labs, even if the original technology was developed by scientists. They're made in food manufacturing facilities that look far more like breweries than they do a science lab.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "It will take years before their commitments to increase their own defence spending might wean them off their reliance on the US for protection from an aggressively expansionist Russia. However, with Trump also announcing at the weekend that he is considering raising the baseline tariff rate to 15 to 20 per cent, they have to take his threat of a 30 per cent tariff \u2013 and additional tariffs to match any retaliatory measures they might take \u2013 seriously. Trump appears impatient that he hasn\u2019t delivered the \u201c90 deals in 90 days\u201d the administration boasted it would deliver, let alone the 200 deals he once said were virtually done. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. EU and US trade officials have been negotiating for months. Credit: Bloomberg He\u2019s also been boosted by the successful passage through Congress of his One Big Beautiful Bill Act and by the buoyancy of US financial markets, which have rebounded from their sell-offs in April, when Trump first unveiled his \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs.\n\nIn April, he deferred imposition of the tariffs until July (and subsequently deferred them again until next month) because the bond market was \u201cgetting a little queasy.\u201d Now markets have settled, with the sharemarket posting record highs. That may be because investors don\u2019t believe he will follow through with the reciprocal tariffs he has threatened \u2013 the \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out\u201d or TACO trade \u2013 or because any ill effects from tariffs, most notably increased inflation, have yet to show up in economic data. Loading No one, including Trump himself, it seems, knows what he might post next on his Truth Social, so markets are behaving as if nothing has happened until something actually happens. August 1 \u2013 the new deadline for his reciprocal tariffs \u2013 could be a wake-up moment for markets. The apparent complacency in markets, in the meantime, is encouraging Trump to be more aggressive and more impatient.\n\nThere is a risk that, rather than heed, as he has until now, the urgings of calmer voices in his cabinet to negotiate deals, he will follow his personal preference and unilaterally present trade partners with \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d ultimatums. While the EU still appears to believe that Trump\u2019s latest threat is a negotiating ploy, they have prepared countermeasures in case it isn\u2019t. The EU had drawn up a list of US exports that it could target in response to the baseline tariff and the sectoral tariffs on steel, aluminium and autos, covering about \u20ac21 billion ($37 billion) of US exports. Items on that list included chicken, motorcycles and clothing. It has another list, targeting another \u20ac72 billion of products, ranging from aircraft to alcohol, with which it could respond to Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs. It also has what it calls its \u201canti-coercion instrument,\u201d or actions that could hit the trade in services, although it is reluctant to deploy that instrument, which it devised in response to a deluge of cheap imports from China.\n\nThe total trade between the US and EU is worth about $US1 trillion ($1.5 trillion), with the EU enjoying a trade surplus in goods of $US235 billion, but a trade deficit in services of about $US75 billion. The EU, in its negotiations with the US, had sought exemptions from Trump\u2019s tariffs for key sectors, such as aircraft and alcohol, in exchange for a promise to buy more US goods, particularly weapons and LNG, that would narrow the US goods trade deficit. Von der Leyen said on Saturday that the EU was ready to continue negotiating but prepared to consider retaliation. Imposing 30 per cent tariffs on EU exports would disrupt essential transatlantic supply chains, harming businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic, she said. The dilemma for the EU is that Trump\u2019s view of its non-tariff policies and trade barriers includes its value-added tax and its regulation of digital activity to protect competition and consumers. No nation state \u2013 or, in the EU\u2019s case, collection of 27 nation states \u2013 would surrender its sovereignty and allow Trump to dictate its domestic policy settings. Having seen what Trump has done to Brazil, threatening a 50 per cent tariff rate in response to unfair trade barriers (even though the US has a trade surplus with Brazil) and its trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 an enthusiastic Trump supporter \u2013 for allegedly plotting a coup, the EU would be conscious of the risk that Trump\u2019s demands may not be confined to its goods trade.\n\nThe potential for a trade confrontation is, therefore, quite significant. The EU will have to decide whether it should roll over and accede to Trump\u2019s demands, damaging its industries and the sovereignty of its states. Alternatively, it could emulate China and allow the confrontation to escalate to the point where it threatens a trade embargo, which would, as China\u2019s tot-for-tat tariffs did, scare the bejesus out of financial market participants and unnerve the White House. Loading Trump\u2019s indiscriminate threats of trade sanctions against America\u2019s friends and foes alike have ignited a scramble by the EU and others to secure new markets. There is potential for a new trading bloc, spanning Europe, the non-Chinese Asia Pacific and Latin America, to emerge. Trump and much of his hand-picked cabinet are protectionists and isolationists. At the conclusion of his trade wars on everyone, if much of the rest of the world decides to trade freely among themselves, he might get what he wished for.",

Wrexham\u2019s suddenly global appeal is the reason why it is happening; commercially and logistically, it just wouldn\u2019t make sense for any other teams to come out here. Usually, it\u2019s just Premier League clubs who turn up, cash in, have a little run around and sell some jerseys. Twice in recent memory - Leeds United (2019) and Wolverhampton Wanderers (2009) - have promoted teams from the Championship come here ahead of their return campaigns in the Premier League. But no lower. In that respect, there is some genuine intrigue about Wrexham AFC vs Sydney FC, a showdown that nobody would have dreamed of before the Reynolds-McElhenney revolution. The Sky Blues had a bit of a stinker in the A-League last season, somehow missing the top six despite boasting a star-studded squad. But most seasons, they would be considered one of the country\u2019s top teams. So are how much better are Wrexham, who finished second in League One, than the Sky Blues? \u201cIt\u2019s difficult,\u201d Sydney FC\u2019s Joe Lolley says.\n\nThere is probably no player better qualified to make a pre-match assessment than Lolley. His career began with Kidderminster Harriers in the Conference (now called the National League), or the fifth tier of English football. But he has also played in the Premier League with Huddersfield Town, in the Championship with them and Nottingham Forest, and, briefly, in League One when he was on loan at Scunthorpe United. That means he has taken the field in four of England\u2019s top five divisions; though he has played cup matches against teams from League Two, the only one he hasn\u2019t played in. He has also played against Wrexham - way back in 2013, three years before the first Deadpool movie came out, when Lolley was with Kidderminster, scoring twice in a 3-1 home win. Few in Australia are better placed to make this assessment than Joe Lolley. Credit: Getty Images Lolley reckons A-League teams compare favourably to those in the Championship and below when it comes to technique; like most Englishmen who come here to play, he was initially surprised by the extent of the local technical skill when he arrived. There are two major differences, he believes. First: physicality.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s a bit of a beast in England when it comes physicality, defensively and off the ball and those sort of things,\u201d he said. Not so much in the A-League. Secondly: squad depth, which is crucial in a gruelling 46-game season. When he was in the Championship, Lolley recalls most teams having about 20-odd players of approximately the same level, competing for starting spots, and the difference between the best and the worst in the division was not huge. The A-League, in contrast, is a lot more \u201cspread out\u201d, and the impact of losing two or three key players can be enormous. There are individuals in Australia who could arguably hold their own in the Premier League, he said, but then some who would probably be better suited to non-league. That\u2019s not being harsh; that\u2019s just the nature of A-League squads, most of which are backfilled by unproven scholarship players and journeymen, and a time when clubs are strapped for cash. But, hypothetically, where would the best teams he\u2019s seen or been part of in Australia wash up in England, on the basis of quality in the starting XI? \u201cProbably the lower end of the Championship,\u201d Lolley says.",

De Minaur tested Novak Djokovic in a high-quality fourth-round contest at Wimbledon. Credit: Getty Images Woodbridge spoke with a still-disappointed de Minaur in the hours after his four-set defeat to Djokovic. De Minaur\u2019s serve was among the topics. \u201cAlex was playing against a guy [Djokovic] who has adjusted his serve throughout his career and made it better \u2013 and that\u2019s the example you have to look at,\u201d Woodbridge said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a great team of people around him, got all the technology, and now it\u2019s time to go back and keep tweaking the technique.\n\nLoading \u201cHe\u2019s got to rotate his shoulders, get his right shoulder back, and get more turn and torque. What he does is take the racquet head out to the right, and that opens him up, and he gets too front-on. \u201cThat [results in] lack of control and trajectory. The best players have great shoulder rotation, hold it in there, and then they uncoil.\u201d Respected Australian coach Craig O\u2019Shannessy made the same observation about de Minaur\u2019s front-on service motion, and said fixing that was not about adding more power but instead would add much-needed serving accuracy. ATP Tour serving analysis last year of the top-20 men\u2019s players found that de Minaur was by far the least accurate in that group, based on placement in the service box.\n\nThat continued at Wimbledon this year, where the Australian\u2019s serves went to the body, rather than the corners, about five times more often than Djokovic and Jannik Sinner. O\u2019Shannessy, who previously worked with Djokovic, said that was an accuracy issue for de Minaur and not a deliberate strategy. The key serve numbers for Alex de Minaur at Wimbledon. Credit: Wimbledon website / IBM \u201cAlex is hitting it in the strike zone [too often] \u2026 he\u2019s losing so many points because the opponent is ready for that,\u201d O\u2019Shannessy told this masthead. \u201cFrom a placement perspective, Novak is serving only [about] three per cent at the body, and everything else is an even mix, so it makes it almost impossible to do a game plan against him.\n\n\u201cAlex has to improve his technique. He has to stay sideways longer. The lower body\u2019s got to rotate and stop, and the upper body then receives that energy and throws that into the arm. He\u2019s over-rotating with [both], and then he\u2019s too front-on.\u201d Djokovic boasts remarkable serving accuracy in 2025 and at this Wimbledon. Almost half Djokovic\u2019s serves on the deuce and advantage sides landed wide or down the T, compared to between two and four per cent to the body, according to IBM tracking data. De Minaur, on the other hand, had about 50 per cent down the T on each side at Wimbledon, but went wide on only 28 and 36 per cent of serves, respectively, on the advantage and deuce sides.\n\nLoading He was at 20 and 17 per cent to the body on the advantage and deuce sides, respectively. Interestingly, Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s percentage of serves to the body this event is even higher than de Minaur. However, Woodbridge said de Minaur should not beat himself up about the Djokovic defeat or become too preoccupied with his serving deficiencies. \u201cAlex is a legitimate top-10 player. The hardest part in this game is getting there, and then it\u2019s even harder to stay there \u2013 but he\u2019s proven he can do that,\u201d Woodbridge said. \u201cI said to him [post-match], \u2018Don\u2019t you dare tell me that you\u2019re not good enough to be in this space. You\u2019re 10 times better a tennis player than I ever was, and a lot of us were, so take your strengths, keep them, and keep working on those small bits that can make you better\u2019.\u201d",

Addressing the news, Red Bull said: \u201cRed Bull has released Christian Horner from his operational duties with effect from today, Wednesday 9 July 2025, and has appointed Laurent Mekies as CEO of Red Bull Racing.\u201d\n\nAfter the explosive texting scandal, Geri stood by her husband, who vehemently denied the claims. Amidst the controversy, Horner was told by his wife to make it \u201call go away\u201d, which he successfully managed for 16 months.\n\nAfter a three-week investigation, the racing boss was cleared of any allegations, including coercive behaviour towards his colleague and internal investigations of wrongdoing.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne day after the verdict was reached, screenshots emerged depicting conversations between Horner and a Red Bull employee. The file reportedly contained texts and images leaked to over 200 people in the sport, including owners Liberty Media, team bosses, and the press.\n\nHorner was cleared for a second time after the female employee appealed against the investigation findings, which were upheld.\n\nHorner has been at the centre of a workplace texting scandal which has rocked Formula One (REUTERS)\n\nIt is understood that an independent lawyer interviewed Horner for almost nine hours.\n\nNetflix\u2019s hugely successful Formula One programme, Drive to Survive, depicted Horner\u2019s immediate reaction to the bombshell news of the alleged texts.\n\n\u201cThe higher you rise, the sharper the knives,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI've reached the top of my game, and I never thought in a million years I'd have a challenge like this in my career,\u201d Horner continued. \u201cIt's a crucial time of year, in a job that I do, you're the front face of the organisation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cYou can either hide away or you can get out there and face it.\u201d\n\nHorner continued to lead Red Bull talent Max Verstappen to win a fourth successive world championship, despite falling short of the constructors\u2019 title to competitors McLaren.\n\nRed Bull superstar Max Verstappen has led the team to four successive world championships (Getty Images)\n\nThat marked the beginning of the end of Red Bull\u2019s dominance, with McLaren now 288 points ahead in the constructors\u2019 standings for the 2025 season.\n\nSince 2005 when Horner joined the team, he successfully led them in two phases to world championships, with drivers Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen, wth eight drivers\u2019 championships and six constructors\u2019 championships.\n\nOliver Mintzlaff, CEO Corporate Projects and Investments, made a few comments thanking Christian Horner for his work over the last two decades.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe would like to thank Christian Horner for his exceptional work over the last 20 years.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWith his tireless commitment, experience, expertise, and innovative thinking, he has been instrumental in establishing Red Bull Racing as one of the most successful and attractive teams in Formula One.\n\n\u201cThank you for everything, Christian, and you will forever remain an important part of our team history.\u201d\n\nAmidst the controversy, Geri asked her husband to \u201cmake it all go away\u201d (Getty Images)\n\nHorner will now be replaced as CEO of Red Bull Racing by Laurent Mekies, followed by the promotion of Alan Permane from current Racing Director to Team Principal.\n\nMekies has been working in F1 since 2001. Speaking of his journey, he said: \u201cThe last year and a half has been an absolute privilege to lead the team with Peter,\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been an amazing adventure to contribute to the birth of Racing Bulls together with all our talented people. The spirit of the whole team is incredible, and I strongly believe that this is just the beginning.\n\n\u201cAlan is the perfect man to take over now and continue our path. He knows the team inside out and has always been an important pillar of our early successes.\u201d\n\nAlan Permane added: \u201cI feel very honoured to take on the role as Team Principal and would like to thank Oliver and Helmut for the trust they have shown in me.\n\n\u201cI am looking forward to working with Peter to continue the good work that both him and Laurent have done in taking this team forward. This is a new challenge for me, but I know that I can count on the support of everyone within them.\u201d",

Mrs Badenoch received just 18 per cent.",

With smart dressing advised and countless celebs spotted in the stands each day, it all makes for a rather stylish affair.\n\nThat\u2019s to say nothing of the players, who are increasingly fashion-aligned themselves. Sport and style have never been such close allies, and tennis is one of the many factions to have benefited from sports\u2019 fashionable facelift.\n\nThe final weekend of the sporting event has seen its most anticipated guest arrive \u2014 the Princess of Wales, who has attended two days in a row.\n\nAs a patron of the All England Lawn Tennis Club it\u2019s Kate Middleton\u2019s job to present the trophies to the winners.\n\nThe Princess of Wales meets Temi Johnson (PA Wire)\n\nToday she is joined by her two eldest children, Princess Charlotte and Prince George, as well as Prince William. Ahead of the men\u2019s final event she greeted the men\u2019s doubles winners, Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool. She wore a tailored royal blue dress with a corsage on the left shoulder.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAlso upping the ante on the A-list power of the final day of the event were actor Keira Knightley and her husband James Righton, as well as Paul Mescal, who sat in the Royal Box with his All of Us Strangers co-star Andrew Scott.\n\n(Adam Davy/PA Wire)\n\nOn Saturday, when the Princess presented Iga Swiatek with her trophy, she had chosen a classic ivory look for the occasion by Self-Portrait. The same designer that she wore to the event in 2023.\n\nThe modest, ankle-grazing design featured a structured blazer top with safari detailing, and a plisse skirt flowing out underneath. She accessorised with simple ivory pumps and the Anya Hindmarch Neeson Small Square Tote in white.\n\nThe Princess of Wales (PA) (PA Wire)\n\nAlso in attendance for the penultimate day of the tennis tournament were Cara Delevingne, director Greta Gerwig and actor Luke Evans.\n\nGreta Gerwig and Sir Mo Farah in the Royal Box at Wimbledon 2025 (PA)\n\nWhile day eleven saw guests like Daisy Lowe, Jourdan Dunn and Jenna Coleman contend with the thirty-degree London heat, with some sunburnt Wimbledon attendees giving a new meaning to strawberries and cream.\n\nJourdan Dunn at Wimbledon 2025 (Getty Images for Pimm's)\n\nColeman looked cool and collected in her white t-shirt and silk slip dress ensemble, paired with blue crocodile skin shoes by Russell and Bromley, while Dunn was radiant in a cream maxi dress (Pimms in hand, obviously).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPaddington and Black Doves actor Ben Whishaw was also looking very prim and proper, somehow surviving the sunshine while wearing a full suit at Centre Court.\n\nBen Whishaw at Wimbledon 2025 (AP)\n\nDay 10 was all about the boys, with actors Hugh Grant and Charlie Hunnam in attendance. Grant looked positively Prime Ministerial in his trademark dark suit, though all political comparisons ceased the moment he donned his massive aviator sunglasses. In fact, it even got a bit secret service.\n\nHugh Grant at Wimbledon 2025 day nine (Getty Images)\n\nHunnam, meanwhile, was on quite the opposite vibe to Grant\u2019s Men in Black cosplay, donning a powder blue suit jacket with a matching shirt, white trousers and a paisley tie. Quite the departure from his Sons of Anarchy alter-ego.\n\nCharlie Hunnam at Wimbledon 2025 day nine (Getty Images for AELTC)\n\nA welcome dose of femininity was brought to the stands by Emily Atack, who wore a pleated pale yellow skirt and a black top with a high-low hemline and gathered shoulders. The Rivals star could be seen enjoying a Pimms outside of Centre Court ahead of taking her seat for the tennis.\n\nEmily Atack at Wimbledon 2025 day nine (Getty Images for Pimm's)\n\nDay nine saw a wealth of famous faces dotted around the stands, from Sir Ian McKellen to Jodie Foster and Sienna Miller, who has naturally topped all the best-dressed lists. The actress donned a puff-sleeved floral mini dress for the occasion, finished with black sunglasses and a dark brown Bottega Veneta handbag. She was joined by her partner Oli Green, who wore a slim-fit navy suit and Ray Bans.\n\nSienna Miller and Oli Green (AP)\n\nAlso present on day nine was England right winger Bukayo Saka, who ditched his football kit for a sand-coloured shirt, cream trousers and suede boat shoes. Saka later linked up with Spanish tennis star (and Wimbledon favourite) Carlos Alcaraz and fellow Arsenal player Jurrien Timber.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTimber was also doing his bit for the fashionable footballer agenda, wearing a long-sleeved cream Miu Miu polo shirt with black trousers and blue suede boat shoes.

Good luck with the rest of the tournament.\u201d\n\nBukayo Saka, Carlos Alcaraz and Jurrien Timber at Wimbledon 2025 day eight (Getty Images for AELTC)\n\nOn day eight, the show was stolen by Trinity Rodman, the American soccer player, daughter of Dennis Rodman and girlfriend of US tennis player Ben Shelton. Rodman wore a cerulean silk two-piece with an asymmetric neckline which she accessorised with dainty gold jewellery and a sleek low bun.\n\nTrinity Rodman and Emma Shelton, Ben Shelton\u2019s sister, at Wimbledon 2024 day seven (Getty Images)\n\nElsewhere, Self Esteem\u2019s low-key day seven fit was the complete opposite end of the spectrum: a lesson in London cool girl dressing, comprised of a loose-fitting shirt, structured grey skirt and split-toe Mary Jane trainers.\n\nGuests on day five and six over the weekend were a vision in a pared-back palette of cream and tennis white.\n\nMonica Barbaro and Andrew Garfield at Wimbledon 2025 (GC Images)\n\nAndrew Garfield confirmed his romance with Monica Barbaro as the pair arrived hand-in-hand wearing matching outfits. He wore white tailoring, with a sweater shrugged around his shoulders, while she wore a structured white slip dress. Also in attendance were The Bear\u2019s Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Poppy Delevingne, who wore Ralph Lauren (what else?).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEarlier in the week, Haringey-born singer Olivia Dean and Manchester United footballer Kobbie Mainoo repped colour of the season, butter yellow. Dean wore an off-shoulder midi dress by Aym Studio, paired with Apollo midi hoop earrings by Daisy London.\n\nOlivia Dean attends Wimbledon 2025 (Getty Images for AELTC)\n\nDay four of Wimbledon was graced with another famous face from the football world, with Newcastle and England star Anthony Gordon looking sharp in the stands, wearing a cream blazer with a powder blue shirt, navy trousers and a navy tie.\n\nAnthony Gordon on Wimbledon 2025 day four (Getty Images for AELTC)\n\nPeriod drama royalty has been present on day four and five. On day four, Downtown Abbey star Jim Carter and his daughter Bessie Carter, who plays Prudence Featherington in Bridgerton, spent some father-daughter time together watching the tennis. India Amarteifio, who plays a young Queen Charlotte in Bridgerton, also made an appearance on day five wearing a plisse polka dot dress.\n\nIndia Amarteifio on Wimbledon 2025 day five (Getty Images for AELTC)\n\nOver in the Royal Box on day three, recent Glastonbury headliner Olivia Rodrigo was enjoying the tennis alongside her boyfriend, the English actor Louis Partridge. The pair were snapped chatting to Tom Daley and sitting side by side with John Cena, in a real melange of celebrity faces.\n\nLouis Partridge, Olivia Rodrigo and Tom Daley at Wimbledon 2025 day three (Mike Egerton/PA Wire)\n\nRodrigo wore a red and white button-down gingham dress with tortoiseshell sunglasses, while Partridge sported a navy blazer, Prada tie and sky blue striped shirt.\n\nNearby were Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra. Chopra went full Wimbledon in a crisp white halter neck dress with strappy heeled sandals, while Jonas was equally preppy in his navy blazer, beige suit trousers and contrast colour shirt, brought together by a black tie.\n\nPriyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas attend Wimbledon 2025 day three (Getty Images for AELTC)\n\nLooking radiant was Leslie Mann, who arrived alongside her husband, director Judd Apatow, as well as Dave Grohl and his wife Jordyn Bloom. The actress, who is the mother of Maude and Iris Apatow (the best friend of Olivia Rodrigo), wore a cream blazer with a long lace skirt and white pumps.\n\nLeslie Mann attends Wimbledon 2025 day three (Ben Whitley/PA Wire)\n\nOn day two, the sartorial standout was undoubtedly Aussie actress Cate Blanchett, who arrived wearing a Giorgio Armani metallic suit reminiscent of her legendary Ocean\u2019s Eight suiting. She rubbed shoulders with unlikely bestie (and fellow Australian) Rebel Wilson, with the two spotted making each other laugh in the stands.\n\nRebel Wilson and Cate Blanchett at Wimbledon 2025 day two (Getty Images)\n\nOn day one, Manchester United legend and freshly knighted Sir David Beckham looked dapper in a cream double-breasted suit by Hugo Boss. A waffle knit brown tie and powder blue shirt brought the look together, with aviator sunglasses and a mysterious hand bandage to top it all off. The former England captain later confirmed this was due to a surgical screw needing to be removed from his hand.\n\nBeckham\u2019s appearance came amid a reported ongoing family feud, but the former footballer showed no whiff of concern as he enjoyed watching the tennis alongside former England manager Gareth Southgate.\n\nDavid Beckham at Wimbledon 2025 day one (Getty Images)\n\nBritish actor Eddie Redmayne was also in attendance in cream tailoring, accompanied by his wife Hannah Bagshawe, who wore a crimson button-down polka dot dress cinched at the waist with a double belt. It was an impressive appearance from Redmayne on more than just the fashion front, given that the actor hot-footed it back from Glastonbury Festival in time to make the Monday matches, which is no mean feat.\n\nHannah Bagshawe and Eddie Redmayne on Wimbledon 2025 day one (Getty Images)\n\nThen there was Barbie star Simu Liu and his wife Allison Hsu, who looked chic in their subtle white and grey looks.\n\nAll the best Wimbledon 2025 looks\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales at Wimbledon 2025 (PA Wire)\n\n(AP)\n\nCara Delevingne, wearing Ralph Lauren, attends day thirteen of the Wimbledon 2025 (Karwai Tang/Getty Images for Ralph Lauren))\n\nThe Princess of Wales with AELTC chairwoman Debbie Jevans (Jordan Pettitt/PA) (PA Wire)\n\nGreta Gerwig and Sir Mo Farah in the Royal Box (PA)\n\nJourdan Dunn at Wimbledon 2025 day eleven (Getty Images for Pimm's)\n\nJenna Coleman at Wimbledon 2025 day eleven (Getty Images for AELTC)\n\nMunya Chawawa at Wimbledon 2025 day eleven (Getty Images for AELTC)\n\nEllie Goulding at Wimbledon 2025 day eleven (Getty Images)\n\nCharlie Hunnam at Wimbledon 2025 day ten (Getty Images for AELTC)\n\nHugh Grant at Wimbledon 2025 day ten (Getty Images)\n\nSelf Esteem at Wimbledon 2025 day eight (Getty Images for AELTC)\n\nTrinity Rodman and Emma Shelton at Wimbledon 2025 day eight (Getty Images)\n\nPoppy Delevingne wearing Ralph Lauren at Wimbledon 2025 (Getty Images for Ralph Lauren)\n\nMonica Barbaro and Andrew Garfield at Wimbledon 2025 (GC Images)\n\nOlivia Dean at Wimbledon 2025 day five (Getty Images for AELTC)\n\nKobbie Mainoo at Wimbledon 2025 day five (Getty Images)\n\nIndia Amarteifio on Wimbledon 2025 day five (Getty Images for AELTC)\n\n(Getty Images for Emirates)\n\nOlivia Rodrigo with Louis Partridge and Tom Daley at Wimbledon 2025 day three (Mike Egerton/PA Wire)\n\nJohn Cena, Shay Shariatzadeh, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas at Wimbledon 2025 day three (Getty Images for AELTC)\n\nTom Daley at Wimbledon 2025 day three (Ben Whitley/PA Wire)\n\nJannik Sinner at Wimbledon 2025 day two (AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSimu Liu and Allison Hsu at Wimbledon 2025 day one (Getty Images for AELTC)\n\nPrincess Beatrice of York at Wimbledon 2025 day one (Getty Images)\n\nKatie Boulter at Wimbledon 2025 day one (Getty Images)\n\nJason Isaacs at Wimbledon 2025 day one (Getty Images)\n\nGareth Southgate and David Beckham at Wimbledon 2025 day one (AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAngela Scanlon at Wimbledon 2025 day one (Getty Images)\n\nRussell Crowe at Wimbledon 2025 day two (AFP via Getty Images)\n\nCoco Gauff at Wimbledon 2025 day two (Getty Images)",

It was exciting for Lorraine to do something different and be on location again.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cDespite the apparent slight in the ITV daytime shake-up, Lorraine\u2019s loyal fanbase isn\u2019t to be underestimated and they will follow her wherever she goes.\n\n\"She\u2019s survived in this business a long time and she\u2019s a master at rolling with the punches.\"\n\nLorraine already has a strong relationship with Channel 4, and regularly appears as a guest on comedy panel show The Last Leg.\n\nIn an interview with TV chef Tom Kerridge on his podcast Proper Tasty, Lorraine said: \u201cForty years in TV last year was incredible. I got a Bafta. \u2018Here\u2019s a Bafta for being alive\u2019.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Hang on a minute, I\u2019m not done yet\u2019.\n\n\u201cI think now I can be a lot cheekier.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a bit naughty. Not so much in the morning but if I do a wee show on Channel 4 or The Last Leg, or something like that, you can be unleashed. I quite like that.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCrew on Lorraine's ITV show are said to have been left feeling \"gutted\" by the cuts to the \"successful rating-busting\" programme, and her two producers now report to This Morning bosses.\n\nThe source added that the shake-up \"casts further doubt\" on the future of her ITV show when her contract expires next year.\n\n\"She\u2019s opening her eyes up to the many options available to her,\u201d they said.",

        "text": "The BMA has called another strike amid its pay dispute with the government. But how does UK pay compare to elsewhere?\n\nHealth secretary Wes Streeting is set to meet British Medical Association (BMA) leaders in an effort to avoid planned strike action, it has been reported.\n\nEarlier this week, the union announced resident doctors \u2013 formerly known as junior doctors \u2013 in England would strike for five consecutive days from 7am on 25 July.\n\nThe BBC reported discussions will take place next week, with the BMA telling the broadcaster industrial action would only be called off if it receives an offer it can put to its members.\n\nThe union has said resident doctors need a pay uplift of 29.2% to reverse \u201cpay erosion\u201d since 2008/09 - and that this is non-negotiable. This figure is based on Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation, the measure of average changes in the price of goods and services used by most households.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStreeting is reportedly sympathetic to improving working conditions for doctors, but will not budge on salaries.\n\nSo, amid the row, how much do resident doctors get paid compared to in other countries?\n\nHow much do NHS doctors get paid?\n\nAs of February, there were 77,287 resident doctors (those in the process of training toward a speciality) working for NHS England.\n\nResident doctors are supervised by a more senior doctor, but as they gain experience some may also begin to supervise their more junior colleagues. Essentially, resident doctors have different levels of seniority and pay.\n\nIn terms of basic pay, resident doctors are set to earn between \u00a338,831 and \u00a373,992 a year for a 40-hour week, as recommended by the pay review body in May. The new rates will be a rise of up to 6% on last year.\n\nAnd, with resident doctors able to earn more if they work extra or unsocial hours, the below chart shows average earnings depending on level:\n\nResident doctor earnings in 2024/25. (Full Fact/PA)\n\nHow much do they get paid abroad?\n\nHere are reported resident doctor salary ranges in some of the most popular countries for UK doctors (of all levels of seniority) to move to, as per a survey in a General Medical Council (GMC) report published in April last year.\n\nAustralia (21% of leavers)\n\nAccording to recruitment agency Medrecruit, resident doctors are paid between \u00a329,000 and \u00a349,000.\n\nNew Zealand (10% of leavers)\n\nMedrecruit says house officers, as they are known, earn between \u00a331,000 and \u00a338,000.\n\nCanada (5% of leavers)\n\nThis varies depending on which province the doctor is working in. Salaries range from \u00a327,000 to \u00a359,000, according to Scotiabank.\n\nIreland (4% of leavers)\n\nBetween \u00a338,000 and \u00a361,000, according to recruitment company IMG Connect.\n\nUAE (2% of leavers)\n\nAllocation Assist Middle East says junior doctors can be paid up to \u00a38,000 a month, which would equate to an annual salary of about \u00a396,000.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs these salary ranges demonstrate, moving abroad doesn't necessarily equate to higher pay. But pay isn't necessarily the main reason for working in a different country: the GMC found the most common reason for leaving the UK was seeking a better quality of life, followed by feeling undervalued.\n\nPay was the third most-cited factor.\n\nHow can the NHS stop NHS doctors moving abroad?\n\nLast year's GMC report also found 30% of UK-based survey respondents said they were likely to relocate abroad within the following year. Meanwhile, a third - 33% - said they are likely to do so \"at some point\".\n\nYahoo News UK approached the BMA, which called this month's resident doctor walkout, for comment on this trend and what can be done to stop doctors moving abroad. It declined, but said in response to the report last year: \u201cThat so many doctors say they are looking to leave for overseas is not surprising... when we consider the immense pressures healthcare staff are under in an overwhelmed service battling huge workforce shortages.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Here, in black and white, we see the main factor driving UK doctors away is pay, and that the majority feel professionally undervalued.\"\n\nHowever, moving abroad for work isn't extraordinary in the medical profession. The GMC report said just under half, 48%, of UK-based doctors surveyed had previously practised medicine abroad. It found these doctors \"were more likely than those who had not previously worked abroad to say they were likely to move abroad in the next 12 months.\n\n\"That such a large proportion of doctors have worked abroad in the past and intend to do so again in the future, suggests that the workforce as a whole could be described as highly mobile.\"\n\nRead more",

        "text": "This photo should strike fear into the heart of all Englishmen,\u201d wrote one. \u201cWhy are they all foreigners?\u201d asked another. \u201cYou are literally teaching children that genocidal replacement is good, so long as it\u2019s white people being replaced,\u201d claimed a third.\n\nAll were responding to a photo that Katharine Birbalsingh had posted on X of a class at her school. The headteacher of Michaela community school, in north-west London, and self-described as \u201cBritain\u2019s strictest headmistress\u201d, Birbalsingh has often faced criticism from the left for her conservative views.\n\nThis time, though, the onslaught was from the far right and hardline racists. The photo was mainly of black and Asian children. For many, this tagged it as a class of \u201cforeigners\u201d. Birbalsingh herself was condemned as an \u201cinvader\u201d. There were more than a thousand responses, most of them hostile.\n\n\u201cRacists always existed,\u201d a bewildered Birbalsingh wrote, but \u201cthings are much, much worse now\u201d. But what is it that is much worse?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere would be little sympathy from the public for the kind of racism Birbalsingh faced. Few people think that to be British is to be white. More than twice as many believe that Britishness is about respecting laws and political institutions rather than ancestry.\n\nWhat has changed is that out-and-out racists have become more confident in proclaiming their bigotry. That confidence rests on the way that ethnic notions of national identity, and laments for white decline, have seeped into the language of mainstream conservatism.\n\n\u201cMass deportation of Pakistanis from Britain. I don\u2019t care how long you\u2019ve lived here. Out,\u201d tweeted Douglas Carswell, the former Conservative and U kip MP. Carswell may be an outlier when it comes to mainstream conservatism, but the idea that Britain has declined because of demographic change is now almost conventional wisdom in certain circles.\n\nThe idea Britain has declined because of demographic change is now almost conventional wisdom in certain circles\n\n\u201cIs there some minimum number of natives that a capital requires before it ceases to be the capital?\u201d David Goodhart, head of the demography unit at the conservative think tank Policy Exchange, wondered recently, referring to data that white people are becoming a minority in London. Perhaps, he suggested, half-jokingly, Nigel Farage might propose \u201cmoving the government to York\u201d. Goodhart acknowledges that \u201cimmigration is not responsible for all London\u2019s ills\u201d, yet frames the city\u2019s decline in terms of demographic change. So does Matthew Goodwin, academic turned Reform advocate, for whom \u201cLondon Is So Over\u201d, brought down by \u201ca toxic cocktail of rapid demographic change, mass immigration, and economic stagnation\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne statistic such critics deploy is that in almost half of social housing in London, the head of the household was born abroad. The implication is that these are foreigners scamming the housing system. \u201cIt is morally wrong,\u201d the shadow home secretary, Chris Philp, tweeted, that \u201c48% of London\u2019s social housing is occupied by people who are foreign\u201d. In fact, these are mostly British nationals, although they were born abroad. The insinuation, though, is that not to be white is not to be British.\n\nLondon \u201chas become a foreign country\u201d, Douglas Murray, the Spectator\u2019s associate editor, has written, because in most boroughs \u201c\u2018white Britons\u2019 are now in a minority\u201d. Britons, the novelist Lionel Shriver suggested, have been forced to \u201cabet incursions by foreigners so massive that the native-born are effectively surrendering their territory\u201d, a process she calls \u201cbiologically perverse\u201d.\n\nIf anyone questions such claims, the usual response is: \u201cBut you\u2019re not listening to people\u2019s fears\u201d, or \u201cSo you want open borders?\u201d There are important and necessary debates about numbers, border controls and public anxieties. But laments over white decline are less about immigration than attempts to turn concerns about immigration into existential fears about identity.\n\nThere is a long history to this. In the debate over the 1905 Aliens Act, Britain\u2019s first immigration control, aimed at barring Jewish refugees fleeing pogroms in eastern Europe, the prime minister, Arthur Balfour, claimed that without the law British \u201cnationality would not be the same\u201d. Half a century later, the Colonial Office worried that \u201ca large coloured community\u201d in Britain \u201cwould weaken\u2026 the concept of England or Britain to which the people of British stock throughout the Commonwealth are attached\u201d. The existential fears eventually dissipate \u2013 who today, except hardline antisemites, would claim that too many Jews would undermine British nationality? \u2013 only to be resurrected again a generation later.\n\nMost mainstream conservatives would reject the arguments of Birbalsingh\u2019s racist critics. Yet it is not that great a leap from viewing Britons of colour as foreign to seeing Birbalsingh\u2019s class as full of foreigners. Few, though, are willing or able to make that connection.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBirbalsingh herself, in a discussion with me on X, denied the link. Mainstream arguments about white identity and decline, she insist ed, were \u201cnot unreasonable\u201d. The problem was \u201cleftist dogma\u201d. It is true that the left\u2019s abandonment of class politics in favour of the politics of identity has allowed racists to rebrand racism as white identit y. The contempt displayed by sections of the left for the working class has pushed many into the arms of the radical right. Nevertheless, the denial by conservatives of the way that mainstream white identitarian arguments have helped pave the way for open racism reveals an extraordinary degree of blinkeredness.\n\nThe dogmatic embrace of demographic change and white decline as one-stop explanations for Britain\u2019s social ills not only brings racialised ideas mainstream but also makes it more difficult to address the real roots of our social problems.\n\nPhotograph by Katharine Birbalsingh @Miss_Snuffy/X",

        "text": "Angela Rayner\u2019s employment law reforms will act as a \u00a35 billion \u201cstealth tax\u201d on workers, a report has warned.\n\nThe Deputy Prime Minister is planning a raft of reforms that will make it easier for workers to strike and introduce new \u201cday-one\u201d rights against unfair dismissal and zero-hours contracts.\n\n\n\nBut they will also work to suppress wages, effectively taxing employees by increasing costs for their bosses, according to analysis by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA).\n\n\n\nThe think tank said smaller pay rises will equate to a \u00a35 billion \u201cstealth payroll tax\u201d, based on the Government\u2019s own impact assessment of the cost on workers.\n\n\n\nBusiness groups have already raised the alarm over the reforms, which they say will make firms more reluctant to hire workers.\n\n\n\nThe Employment Rights Bill, which returns to the Commons on Monday, contains measures to make it easier for workers to form unions and launch strike action.\n\nAndrew Griffith says the bill is \u2018a Trojan horse for union power and state interference\u2019 - Elliott Franks\n\nAndrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said they would result in 1970s-style union militancy and hammer struggling businesses.\n\n\n\n\u201cLabour\u2019s love-in with the unions is dragging Britain back to the worst economic mistakes of the 1970s,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe so-called Employment Rights Bill is nothing more than a Trojan horse for union power and state interference.\n\n\n\n\u201cFar from protecting workers, it will price people out of jobs, deterring investment and sending small businesses to the wall.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn June, the Conservatives pledged to scrap the Bill if they return to office, warning the plans would \u201cgrind our economy to a halt\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe IEA\u2019s report, by Prof J.R. Shackleton, argues that the plans will \u201cput the public through the wringer\u201d and \u201cextort more pay from the government \u2013 which means, of course, the taxpayer\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe Telegraph understands the workers\u2019 rights plan has already been the subject of dispute between Ms Rayner and the Treasury, which is concerned about the impact on business confidence and economic growth.\n\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain\u2019s independent fiscal watchdog, has said they will have a \u201cprobably net negative\u201d impact on a range of economic indicators, including employment, prices, and productivity.\n\n\n\nThe Government\u2019s impact assessment found that the reforms will result in \u00a35 billion higher costs for businesses, which the IEA said would be passed to workers in the form of lower wages.\n\nMs Rayner has argued that the new rules will boost living standards, giving the public an \u201cupgrade to our growth prospects and the reforms our economy so desperately needs\u201d.\n\n\u2018Billions in hidden costs\u2019\n\nThe professor of economics at the University of Buckingham said: \u201cPoliticians love to announce new employment \u2018rights\u2019 because they think employers pay the bill \u2013 but that\u2019s an illusion.\n\n\n\n\u201cEvery mandate, from parental leave to holiday entitlements, acts like a stealth tax that gets passed back to workers through smaller pay rises than they would otherwise receive. The only difference is that no money is raised for the Exchequer,\u201d said Prof Shackleton.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Employment Rights Bill will make this much worse, imposing billions in hidden costs that workers will ultimately bear themselves.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Government is not protecting workers \u2013 it is harming them and undermining its own alleged number one priority to boost economic growth.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA government spokesman said: \u201cToo many workers are trapped in insecure, low-paid work, with weak protections that are poorly enforced.\n\n\u201cThrough our transformative Plan for Change, this government will deliver the biggest upgrade to workers\u2019 rights in a generation, contributing to economic growth, and our measures have strong support from businesses and the public.\u201d",

        "text": "Coffee vs tea: which one is really better for your health?\n\nCoffee vs tea: which one is really better for your health?\n\nIn the battle of the brews which side are you on? A traditional tea-sipper or an on-the-go espresso-shotter? Whether you prefer a cuppa or a cappuccino it turns out both morning drinks are packed with health benefits. A new study has found that drinking one to three cups of caffeinated coffee a day may help you live longer \u2013 as long as you go easy on the sugar and cream.\n\nThe research by Tufts University analysed data from over 46,000 adults and concluded that moderate coffee consumption was linked to a 14\u201317% lower risk of death from any cause. However, those benefits vanished when drinks were loaded with sweeteners or lots of saturated fat such as cream \u2013 a splash of milk is fine. Fang Fang Zhang, senior author of the study, said: \u201cCoffee is among the most-consumed beverages in the world, and with nearly half of American adults reporting drinking at least one cup per day, it's important for us to know what it might mean for health. The health benefits of coffee might be attributable to its bioactive compounds.\u201d\n\nThese compounds can help combat oxidative stress and cellular damage; help reduce chronic inflammation \u2013 a root cause of many modern illnesses \u2013 and reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.\n\nBut it\u2019s not the only caffeinated beverage that comes with health benefits. A cup of tea is not only a balm to all emotional woes \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll stick the kettle on\u201d \u2013 but also good for our bodies and brains. Here are all the health benefits of both coffee and tea.\n\nIs tea healthy?\n\nJust like coffee, tea \u2013 whether black, green, white, or oolong \u2013 is packed full of bioactive compounds. Tea is loaded with polyphenols like catechins (especially in green tea) and theaflavins (in black tea), which act as antioxidants. They help neutralize harmful free radicals, reducing oxidative stress and lowering the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and certain cancers. These polyphenols also feed the good bacteria in our gut microbiomes and a healthy gut is linked to overall health.\n\nRegular tea consumption has health benefits (Pexels)\n\nRegular tea consumption has also been linked to improved heart health by reducing LDL (bad) cholesterol, improving blood vessel function, and lowering blood pressure. Nutritionist and researcher Dr Pamela Mason from the Tea Advisory Panel says that, as they both come from plants, tea and coffee are both healthy choices, but tea does stand out for one reason. \u201cThere is one major difference with tea and that\u2019s the fact it contains L-theanine, a unique amino acid \u2013 and it is only found in tea,\u201d she says. \u201cStudies show that L-theanine - particularly when combined with a small amount of caffeine \u2013 reduces stress and focuses the brain, helping concentration.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cBrain scans show that L-theanine in green and black tea increases alpha-wave activity, which induces relaxation without drowsiness.\u201d pThis means that while a cup of tea will make you feel alert, because of the caffeine, it also brings about a sense of calm which, come bed-time, will also help you sleep.\n\nWhat are the health benefits of coffee?\n\nA regular cup of coffee contains about two to three times more caffeine than black tea which gives you a quicker, more intense energy boost. It also boosts metabolism and increases fat burning. In fact, studies suggest that caffeine can increase resting metabolic rate by about 3\u201311% depending on the dose, your body weight, and how accustomed you are to caffeine \u2013 a tolerance is built over time.\n\nSurprisingly, coffee contains small amounts of dietary fibre \u2013 specifically, soluble fibre \u2013 which can contribute modestly to our daily intake and supports gut health. Unfiltered coffee such as espresso or Turkish coffee are thought to contain more fibre than filter coffee.\n\nThree cups of coffee a day is the optimum for heart health (Pexels)\n\nCoffee also contains some bioactive compounds that aren\u2019t present in tea such as diterpenes (cafestol and kahweol) and melanoidins. Diterpenes, present mainly in unfiltered coffee like espresso and French press, have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and liver-protective effects. Melanoidins form during roasting and act as powerful antioxidants and prebiotics, supporting gut health and reducing inflammation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne of the most consistent findings in coffee research is the link between moderate coffee drinking and reduced heart disease risk. Three to four cups a day is consistently associated with a lower risk of developing heart disease.\n\nHow much tea and coffee should I drink a day?\n\nGenerally, three to four cups of coffee per day is considered optimal for health benefits for most people. For black tea, because it contains less caffeine, the recommended number is three to five.\n\nWhich is better for our health: tea or coffee?\n\nThe good news is both delicious beverages are also super healthy so choose whichever you prefer. Or, don\u2019t choose! Drink both and benefit from their unique properties.",
