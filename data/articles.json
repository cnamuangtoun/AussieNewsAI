(Facebook/The Queenscliffe Family Hotel)\n\n\"It's not unusual to see koalas wandering sort of around the streets in Kingscote,\" she said.\n\n\"He just wandered down the road and then just walked into the front of the bottle shop that's attached to the pub.\"\n\nThe koala appeared to be looking for a cool spot to escape the \ufeffsun.\n\n\ufeffArthur said the koala wandered into the main area of the bottle shop and parked himself by the fridges for a few minutes.\n\nThe koala appeared to be looking for a place to cool down. (Facebook/The Queenscliffe Family Hotel)\n\nThe koala didn't appear injured or in distress but staff contacted a local vet and wildlife services just to be sure.\n\nThey also provided a bowl of water for the koala to sip on while he was in the store.\n\n\ufeff\"Somebody from the wildlife group came down and had a look at him,\" Arthur said.\n\n\"Made sure he wasn't in distress, made sure he was OK, and they just left him there.\"\n\nBecause it's so common to see koalas in the trees around \ufeffKingscote, where the pub is located, local patrons didn't make much of a fuss about the koala.\n\nTourists, on the other hand, were delighted at getting to see one of Australia's iconic native animals up close and personal.\n\n\"We just monitored him, made sure they weren't harassing him,\" Arthur said, adding that humans should refrain from touching or interacting with wild koalas.\n\n\"And then he wandered back out.\"\n\nThough it's quite uncommon for koalas to venture into businesses or homes on Kangaroo Island, Arthur said she doubted this will be the last time it happens at \ufeffThe Queenscliffe Family Hotel.\n\n\"It's just one of those things over here,\" she mused.\n\n\"Nothing's ever normal on Kangaroo Island.\"",

(Instagram/@jujugems.jewellery)\n\n\"Jules and I have been in the industry for such a long time, we've been through global financial crises and all these ups and downs, but this is next level,\" Cooper told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"Every week we're checking and the gold price has jumped, and it's just adding a lot of extra work to us and making it really hard for us.\"\n\nGold prices tend to spike in \ufefftimes of economic turbulence and inflation worries, as it's considered a \"safe haven\" investment separate from national economies \u2013 so it's no wonder that \ufeffprices are surging now.\n\nAnd while the price hikes are tipped to push Australia's gold earnings to $60 billion in the 2025-26 financial year\ufeff, it could cripple small businesses.\n\n\"It's getting harder for little boutiques like us and artists who create handmade pieces here in Australia,\" Cooper said.\n\n\"We don't want to send anything offshore, we don't want to get anything mass made, but with the price of gold, it is getting harder and harder, and I think you will probably see some small guys like us really struggling.\"\n\nThis week she and Modica made the decision to only honour bespoke quotes for a week instead of months, as prices change so quickly.\ufeff\n\nIt's just one of the sacrifices they've had to make to stay profitable.\n\nThe duo have also had to cut down on the amount of gold they use in their jewellery, along with raising the prices on ready-to-wear and custom gold pieces, and constantly repricing their stock to align with the ever-increasing cost of gold.\n\nThe cost of making gold pieces like this has skyrocketed with gold prices. (Instagram/@jujugems.jewellery)\n\n\ufeff\"At first, we were just absorbing most of the spikes and wouldn't increase our costs,\" Cooper said, but it was costing the business too much in lost profits.\n\nNow they constantly have to check gold prices and adjust their own.\n\nIt's costing them time that could be spent designing and making the jewellery that pays their bills.\n\n\"There's so many struggles with small business right now, and this adds to our daily struggle,\" Cooper said.\n\n\"As a small business, we tend to cut costs by paying ourselves very minimum wages and that hurts, especially with the cost of living ... it does feel like a major setback.\"\n\n\ufeffThe number of customers willing to pay for bespoke jewellery has nearly halved due to financial strain and skyrocketing gold prices.\n\nAnd it's probably only going to get worse in the months and years to come.\n\nSmall businesses like Juju Gems are already struggling with the cost of living - the cost of gold just makes it harder. (Instagram/@jujugems.jewellery)\n\n\ufeffCooper and Modica have been in the jewellery industry for about 20 and 40 years respectively and have never seen the price of gold dip by more than a few dollars.\n\nThey don't expect that to suddenly change now.\ufeff\n\n\"We're not going to hold out for the price to drop, although it would be amazing, I think it's just a pipe dream,\" Cooper said.\n\nGiving up on gold to save the business money isn't an option either.\n\nJuju Gems is all about creating high-quality jewellery pieces that can be passed down through generations and that just can't be achieved with cheaper materials.\n\nSo \ufeffCooper and Modica will just have to keep coming up with ways to adapt.\n\nOne tactic that has been working well for the duo is encouraging customers to trade in their unwanted gold jewellery to lower the cost of creating new gold pieces.\ufeff\n\nJuju Gems created this custom piece using gold the client had lying around at home. (Instagram/@jujugems.jewellery)\n\n\ufeffMillions of Australians have gold lying around the house, from family heirlooms to jewellery they just \ufeffdon't wear anymore.\n\nWhat they may not know is that it could be worth hundreds or even thousands of dollars \u2013 provided it's solid gold, not plated.\n\n\ufeff\"We have women come in who started accumulating jewellery in the '80s and they are sitting on quite a lot of money,\" Cooper said.\n\n\"And what they're getting back in trade-in is significantly more than what they paid for it.\"\n\nHave you got a story?

        "text": "I remember I was in the car, driving to my sister's house. My phone rang, it was one of my girlfriends.\n\nI answered, chirpy and about to gush about how I'd just met my baby nephew for the first time and was on my way for more cuddles - but the tone of her voice stopped me cold.\n\nShe asked me to call her back once I'd gotten home, not keen to distract me with some bad news while I was driving.\n\nBCNA's new campaign reinforces the importance of taking a look. At every opportunity. (Supplied)\n\nBut I pulled into a service station instead, insisting she tell me then. She broke down as she relayed the news that our beautiful friend Paula, had just been diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. Time stood still.\n\nI had so many questions but was also completely lost for words. Parked in the middle of a suburban petrol station, I burst into tears, as I tried to digest the devastating news.\n\nPaula had just turned 33, days earlier. She'd just given birth to her first child only months before that. She was healthy, hard-working, the kindest person you'll ever meet. I didn't want to believe it.\n\nShe was too young to have breast cancer! She was still breastfeeding her little girl! She was in the prime of her life! And yet she was now in the biggest fight of her life. It just wasn't fair.\n\nI immediately thought back to my chat with Paula just a few days earlier, when she was telling me about nipple rawness that doctors had linked to general breastfeeding sensitivities.\n\nSince 2000, rates among women aged 30-39 have risen \"modestly\" according to Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA), and more \"sharply\" for women aged 40-49. (Supplied)\n\nShe had also, during the last trimester of her pregnancy, felt a lump under her left arm, but doctors thought that it was most likely a blocked milk duct.\n\nMany women will know that lumps and bumps pre and post partum are often attributed to hormonal changes or blocked milk ducts. But this time, Paula had pushed for more tests.\n\nAnd sure enough, that lump proved to be much more sinister - Paula was diagnosed with stage 2, grade 3, aggressive HER2 positive breast cancer. Her newborn bubble had burst.\n\nShe was forced to immediately stop breastfeeding and a whirlwind of further testing began - CT scans, MRIs, surgery to biopsy her lymph nodes and fertility preservation - ahead of a gruelling chemotherapy treatment plan.\n\nShe had chemo for six months - the first three months was brutal, Paula says that part of the treatment is known as \"the red devil\" for its potency.\n\nShe also opted to have cold capping during chemo, a painful process but one that saved about 60 per cent of her hair. Then came months of targeted therapy, followed by the most physically altering process - a double mastectomy.\n\nIt was a four-to-five-hour surgery that included reconstruction and involved a recovery process which prohibited her from picking up her one-year-old daughter for six weeks. My heart breaks just thinking back on it all.\n\nBut thankfully, through resilience, grace, and incredible medical care and guidance, cancer was no match for Paula. After about nine months, and that debilitating treatment process, doctors gave Paula the news we'd all been hoping for - she was clear of cancer.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Routine breast cancer test could be used to screen heart disease\n\nBut thankfully, through resilience, grace, and incredible medical care and guidance, cancer was no match for Paula. (Supplied)\n\nShe still had to complete some treatment, and while any patient with lived experience with cancer will tell you they're never really \"free\", it was the end to a significant and painful chapter.\n\nPaula of course lives with ongoing check-ups and the scars of her double mastectomy. But now, those scars are more a reminder of what she's overcome.\n\nShe's been able to have another child, and restore normality to her life. And now, she's investing her experience into advocacy for future generations of young breast cancer patients. And she's an advocate we desperately need - today, around three Australian women under the age of 40, will be diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nThe same will happen again tomorrow. And again the following day.\n\nEach year, it's on the rise. Since 2000, rates among women aged 30-39 have risen \"modestly\" according to Breast Cancer Network Australia (BCNA), and more \"sharply\" for women aged 40-49.\n\nThe network says these younger women are more likely to be diagnosed at later stages or with more aggressive disease.\n\nBCNA's new campaign reinforces the importance of taking a look. At every opportunity. (Supplied)\n\nIn Australia, the federal BreastScreen program \"actively invites\" women aged 50-74 to have a free mammogram every two years.\n\nWomen aged 40-49 and 75 or over are instead simply \"eligible\" for a free screening, but need to proactively contact their local service if they wish to book an appointment. In our busy lives, it's not hard to see how something like that might be overlooked.\n\nThat's exactly why BCNA's new campaign reinforces the importance of taking a look, at every opportunity.\n\nThey're asking women to \"Know Yourself. Feel Yourself\", and literally feel around for any inconsistencies when it comes to your breast health.\n\nThey want women to give their breasts the same daily attention we give our faces in the mirror. Think about that - how many hours do we collectively spend cleansing, moisturising, applying make-up, to our faces, every single day.\n\nWhy not spend just a fraction of that time familiarising yourself with your breasts? In the shower, when you're getting dressed, undressed, on the couch watching TV, or while in the kitchen waiting for a meal to cook. Normalise knowing your breasts.\n\nAnd if something feels off, get it checked out. You might just catch something early. And when it comes to a breast cancer prognosis, the sooner it can be treated, the better an outcome might be - just like it was, for my friend Paula.",

(Supplied)\n\nWatkins' full name is 2253 words long and it was recognised again by the Guinness World Records after a small change to his 1992 title, revising it from the world's longest christian name to world's longest personal name.\n\n\"I always wanted to be a little bit famous,\" he told 9news.com.au .\n\n\"I read the 1989 Guinness World Records from cover-to-cover and that was really the only record I could have a chance of beating.\"\n\nAt the time in New Zealand, there was no law stopping Watkins from changing his legal name to something absurd.\n\nDo you have a story? Contact reporter April Glover at april.glover@nine.com.au\n\nNow, official names usually can't be longer than 70 characters and can't resemble or be an official title or rank.\n\nThat wasn't the case when Watkins first petitioned to have his name changed.\n\n\"I chose Lord, Duke, King and Saint as some of my names, I sort of rubbed it in their faces, and one of the two laws they changed after I won was that you couldn't have a title as your name in New Zealand,\" Watkins said.\n\n\"But my favourite name is AZ2000.\"\n\nHis world record pursuit didn't come without a court date, though.\n\nIt was accepted in the district court but when Watkins went to change his driver's license, the clerk didn't believe him.\n\nWatkins' original passport from 1991 had the extra pages attached. (Supplied)\n\nWatkins was challenged by a registrar to take it to the High Court after he didn't accept his lengthy moniker.\n\n\"He called me frivolous, and he said the only way I would force him to go ahead and register my name is if I took him to the High Court,\" Watkins recalled.\n\nHe did exactly that and walked away with the world's longest name.\n\nWatkins' old passport in New Zealand had an extra six pages attached to it to accommodate for his 2000+ extra names.\n\nAnd his revised birth certificate has another six pages added to the back of it too.\n\nGuinness World Records originally awarded him for 2310 names but was later updated this week to 2253 following a change to the record guidelines.\n\nWatkins said he hoped his newly-revised world record will be in the 2026 Guinness World Records. (Supplied)\n\nThe original world record awarded to Watkins. (Supplied)\n\nEven Watkins can't remember all the names and it took him hours to count them out.\n\nTo give you a taste: it's in alphabetical order and his name starts as Laurence Alon Aloys Aloysius Alphege Alun Alured Alwyn Alysander Ambie Ambrose.\n\nAnd it goes on.\n\n\"I'm hoping it will be in next year's [Guinness] book, unless somebody in the world beats me in the meantime,\" Watkins said.\n\n\"Even if I lose the world record, nobody in New Zealand can beat my record, because of the law change.\"",

        "text": "Italy: By now, it's common for almost every traditional car brand to have some sort of offering in the electric car market in Australia.\n\nWhile EVs make up just 10 per cent of all new car sales, and growing slowly, the introduction of an electric model can bring new customers to a brand and create a new experience for existing owners.\n\nHowever, many people might be shocked to hear that Ferrari is launching their own full electric car next year.\n\nFerrari's chief product development officer Gianmaria Fulgenzi stressed the importance of the announcement. (Nine)\n\nFar from a traditional new car launch, Ferrari's gathering of the world's media at their factory in Maranello, Italy revealed only the direction the company was taking as well as the raw and bare underpinnings of the future electric car - the chassis.\n\nThe first of three steps toward revealing the car itself somewhere mid-way through next year, today's event was about setting a benchmark for what to expect, and also creating some certainty for fans of the brand that this new EV would indeed be every bit as Ferrari.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to 9News, Ferrari's chief product development officer Gianmaria Fulgenzi stressed the importance of this announcement, saying \"it's a new chapter of our history\".\n\n\"It's a very important day for us,\" Fulgenzi said.\n\n\"Let me say an historic day, because we wanted to continue our electrification journey starting many years ago.\"\n\nFerrari revealed only the direction the company was taking as well as the raw and bare underpinnings of the future electric car. (Ferrari)\n\nThat journey, as he outlines, took the company from their electrified Formula One cars, into road cars like the LaFerrari, SF90 and others which feature hybrid electrified powertrains to today.\n\n\"We wanted to complete this electrification journey to develop a completely new car,\" Fulgenzi said.\n\n\"Also to enlarge the customer base for our car.\"\n\nThere is no question, though, that petrol-powered internal combustion engines will continue to be part of the Ferrari line-up for a long time to come.\n\nAs Fulgenzi put it, Ferraris will be \"not all electric, but also electric\".\n\nWhile announcing this Ferrari Elettrica, the company was at pains to point out its deep knowledge of what makes a car feel great to drive - what it is that creates the thrill of driving that Ferraris are known for.\n\nIn fact, they know it, and spell it out well: sound, gear change, braking, lateral and longitudinal acceleration.\n\nThe car itself will be revealed somewhere mid-way through next year. (Ferrari)\n\nSo can an electric car replicate all these sensations?\n\nFulgenzi says: \"It's not only an electric car, it's a Ferrari.\"\n\nSimple as that.\n\n\"First of all. First and foremost, it's a Ferrari.\n\n\"What does it mean? What does it mean that the car that has an electric powertrain, but that creates the same emotion of the other Ferrari cars.\"\n\nThere's a real emotive sense to Fulgenzi's passion for this brand and this upcoming car, based around that driving experience.\n\n\"Driving thrills are something that starts in the brain, explode in the heart, creating butterflies in the stomach, and create a very big smile in the face when you drive the car and push you and your companion or your family to use the car massively every day, every moment, because using the car, you enjoy yourself.\"\n\nLike other Ferraris before it, over decades, the all-electric Ferrari will be born in Maranello, Fulgenzi pointing out the significance of this.\n\nThe announcement created some certainty for fans of the brand that this new EV would indeed be every bit as Ferrari. (Ferrari)\n\n\"We are very proud to say that every core components are thought, developed and produced in-house,\" he said.\n\n\"Because like we have done in the last 78 years for the internal combustion engine that we produce, we think, we develop, we test our internal combustion engine in-house - and also for the electric components.\n\n\"For the inverter, for the battery system these components, the key components for the electric cars.\n\n\"So we want strongly to develop them in-house and to keep them in-house, to pursue the excellence and also to guarantee the usability for the car also for the future.\"\n\nI witnessed the very factory floor where the battery is being assembled from raw battery cells, where electric motors are built, paired with gearing and placed into assemblies forged within a few kilometre radius of each other - all by Ferrari.\n\nWe won't see this new electric car until half-way through next year, but here's what we can surmise based on what we've heard thus far.\n\nThe Ferrari Elettrica will be a new model and carry a new name.\n\nIt will also be an SUV body shape, perhaps similar to the Purosangue which is on the roads today.\n\nAnd it will be fast, very fast.\n\nA top speed of 310km/h, accelerating from zero to 100km/h in just 2.5 seconds.\n\nA 122kWh battery will provide at least 530km of range and four motors will power each of the wheels independently, each of which can also steer with the front wheels able to be disconnected from the drivetrain in search of range on open highway driving.\n\nThe specifications look fantastic, and if the company can deliver on the exterior design in the same way they have the underlying technology, then we're in for something very special.",

Certified paedophile\u2026\"\n\nWhy did Drake sue Universal Music?\n\nFiled in January, Drake's lawsuit alleged UMG intentionally published and promoted the track despite knowing it contained false and defamatory allegations against Drake and suggested listeners should resort to vigilante justice.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleged that the track tarnished his reputation and decreased the value of his brand.\n\nLamar was not named in the lawsuit.\n\nDrake claimed the song amounted to \"falsely accusing him of being a sex offender, engaging in paedophilic acts\" and more.\n\nHe also blamed the tune for attempted break-ins and the shooting of a security guard at his Toronto home.\n\nDrake's mansion was depicted in an aerial photo in the song's cover art.\n\nThe digital cover art for Not Like Us. (Deezer)\n\nNot Like Us became a 'cultural sensation'\n\nMs Vargas said in her opinion Thursday that Not Like Us \"dealt the metaphorical killing blow\" in the feud between the two artists.\n\n\"The song contains lyrics explicitly accusing Drake of being a paedophile, set to a catchy beat and propulsive bassline,\" she said.\n\n\"Not Like Us went on to become a cultural sensation, achieving immense commercial success and critical acclaim.\"\n\nWhy Drake and Kendrick Lamar's feud is great for rap Photo shows A fiery graphic reads \"VS\" with an image of Drake on the left and Kendrick Lamar the right Why are rap's biggest names fighting? And why is that good business for everyone involved? Here's your answers.\n\nPrior to that, the judge noted as she summarised the back-and-forth insults, Drake mocked Lamar's height and shoe size and questioned his success in an April 2024 track called Push Ups, while Lamar insulted Drake's fashion sense that same month in Euphoria.\n\nFrom there, Ms Vargas wrote, the insults escalated and become \"vicious, personal\".\n\nJudge says Not Like Us is opinion\n\nThe judge said in making her decision, she considered the forum in which the insults occurred and concluded that the average listener was \"not under the impression that a diss track is the product of a thoughtful or disinterested investigation, conveying to the public fact-checked verifiable content.\"\n\nMs Vargas wrote that Not Like Us was \"replete with profanity, trash-talking, threats of violence, and figurative and hyperbolic language, all of which are indicia of opinion.\"\n\nA reasonable listener, she added, \"would conclude that Lamar is rapping hyperbolic vituperations\".\n\n\"In the context of this rap diss battle, no reasonable person would listen to Not Like Us and assume that Lamar uniquely had access to credible, provable facts that revealed Drake to be a paedophile,\" she wrote.\n\nThe real winners in Drake vs Kendrick Photo shows A composite image of the rappers Kendrick and Drake both rapping into microphones. Kendrick Lamar and Drake's intense feud risks commodifying and objectifying black people, argues hip-hop scholar.\n\nUniversal 'pleased' with outcome\n\nUMG, which is the parent record label for both artists, denied the allegations in the lawsuit.\n\n\"From the outset, this suit was an affront to all artists and their creative expression and never should have seen the light of day,\" UMG said in a statement.\n\n\"We're pleased with the court's dismissal and look forward to continuing our work successfully promoting Drake's music and investing in his career.\"\n\nABC with AP",

        "text": "Anthony Albanese's request for Treasury to examine a controversial proposal to lift taxes on some superannuation balances is \"nothing unusual\" the prime minister says, rejecting claims he is planning to rewrite it.\n\nThe prime minister said a meeting on the tax policy, which was meant to have begun several months ago, was not out of the ordinary.\n\n\"No, there are no policy changes, our policy stands. There is nothing unusual,\" Mr Albanese said.\n\n\"We receive briefings on policy all the time, as you expect the prime minister's office to do. There's nothing unusual about that.\"\n\nTreasury officials admitted yesterday the prime minister's office met with the department to discuss the government's proposal to raise the tax on superannuation earnings \u2014 a policy that would normally be the responsibility of Treasurer Jim Chalmers.\n\nMr Albanese denied he had gone over the treasurer's head.\n\nThe department said it was examining options to address concerns around the tax proposal.\n\nBefore the federal government announced a backflip on stage three tax cuts last term, the prime minister and treasurer repeatedly said there was \"no plan\" to amend the tax cuts.\n\nIn the weeks before that backflip, it was leaked that Treasury had been asked to model possible changes to those tax cuts.\n\nTax increase put on ice\n\nThe federal government proposed last term to double the tax on superannuation balances above $3 million, lifting the tax rate on earnings from 15 to 30 per cent.\n\nThe change was planned to take effect from July 1 this year, and raise about $2 billion a year.\n\nHow does Labor's new super tax work and why is it controversial? Photo shows A close-up of Jim Chalmers in front of a black background. The proposal to tax earnings for super balances over $3 million, including on unrealised gains, is the subject of renewed controversy following the federal election.\n\nBut it has been met with internal resistance inside Labor, and criticism from party elders including former prime minister Paul Keating, who suggested the average young person today would be hit by the tax increase by the time they retired if it was not changed.\n\nMore than two years on, the legislation is yet to be seen.\n\nOne of the key criticisms is that because the higher tax rate is not indexed, more people will be captured by it over time due to inflation.\n\nIt would also apply to unrealised capital gains, like increases in the value of assets like property, which critics say could expose some savers to a higher tax rate even if they do not technically have access to those earnings.\n\nThere is concern the changes could undermine confidence in the superannuation system, if it was perceived that long-term savings plans could be meddled with by future governments.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers argues the change affects only about 80,000 of the wealthiest Australians, and that the threshold could be adjusted in the future to account for bracket creep, as happens with income tax.",

(ABC News: Gian De Poloni)\n\nIn some areas of Perth, people wanting to downsize while staying in the same neighbourhood face almost no options.\n\n\"For example, in Lesmurdie [in the Perth foothills] in the last 12 months, there have been 113 house sales, and just one unit sold,\" Mr Collins said.\n\n\"And that's not because there's not demand for it, there's just no stock.\n\n\"There are dozens of suburbs across Perth where we just don't have that choice, and 80 per cent of people, when they downsize, they want to stay in their local community.\n\nMr Collins said while the issue was reflective of Australia's current housing crisis, there had also been long-term resistance from many local communities to building medium-density housing.\n\n\"In City Beach, a number of years ago, they were going to bring in duplexes \u2014 or maisonettes \u2014 on corners, and there was a mini revolution at the community level.

(ABC Radio Perth: Emma Wynne)\n\nBuilding industry preferences\n\nArchitect Michelle Blakeley said there was also a lack of support from builders and developers for smaller townhouses and units.\n\n\"You go onto the websites of any of the big builders, and you will only find three-bedroom, two-bathroom, games room, computer room houses with a double garage under the main roof,\" she said.\n\n\"We've actually spoken to some of the bigger builders about coming down to a two-bedroom, one bathroom house. They're just not interested.\n\n\"And people are reluctant to buy a two-bedroom, one bathroom house, because they've been convinced that it's a better investment to have a three-bedroom.\"\n\nAsset-rich, cash-poor\n\nFor many would-be downsizers, the sale of the family home would involve buying another home and paying stamp duty. Then, any cash leftover from the sale would be considered in the pension assets test, potentially reducing a retiree's payments.\n\nFor Don from Maylands, it's an impossible equation.\n\n\"We've been looking for a couple of years at the options for downsizing,\" he told the panel.\n\n\"And every single time we come up against a financial barrier that says, no, it's not worth our while to do it.\n\n\"That's irrespective of availability, or any of the other constraints that are in there.

He has no money, very little superannuation, and he's barely limping by.\n\n\"And he said to me: 'If I were to sell this property, I would lose it all. I'd lose all my pension. I'd have to go and find somewhere to live and that would be really hard for me. I would pay stamp duty. I would pay all these costs.'\"\n\nAdvice to plan early\n\nBut Mr Kinsella cautioned against simply deciding that downsizing was too hard, stressing it was better to plan for your needs in old age early, before the situation became a crisis.\n\n\"I think it's really important that your home meets your needs as you age,\" he said.\n\n\"Ask yourself, are you in an environment that you're safe in? Is it going to meet your caring needs?\n\n\"What breaks my heart is we hear from older people all the time who have stayed in their home, I believe, too long, and then their needs change and they can no longer stay in that home, and the family is then forced to do a fire sale of their property.\n\n\" Choose something that's going to work for you now, so you can age in your new home, rather than family making this decision when someone's in a hospital bed and they've got very few options. \"\n\nHe said deciding while still well gave people time to figure out their options.\n\n\"Many older people maybe haven't been in the property market for 30 years,\" he said.\n\n\"Start to get yourself familiar with how the property market works, hearing what agents are good to work with, what developers are good to work with, who you want to trust, and start that conversation.\"",

(ABC Radio Sydney: Declan Bowring)\n\nStephen Beaman from the NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) told ABC Radio Sydney the companies would be required to engage an independent noise expert to help find the noise and identify solutions.\n\n\"Following our investigations [the EPA] issued some legally-binding conditions on two companies out of the Camellia peninsula,\" Mr Beaman said.\n\n\"Those conditions require them to engage an independent noise expert to thoroughly go through each facility and look for potential sources of noises and come up with remedial strategies to address it.\"\n\nA James Hardie premises is one of two businesses identified as the potential source of the disturbing noise.

Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe Giants are happy to bring the 24-year-old defender back to the club, but they will need to do some re-jigging to fit him in, given the league\u2019s list rules. There is also a chance another team emerges as an Aleer suitor.\n\nAFL clubs can have between 36 and 38 players on their primary list, and GWS are already at 35 before trading for Melbourne midfielder Clayton Oliver or potentially re-signing Aleer.\n\nThe challenge for the Giants is they must make at least three national draft selections, so Oliver\u2019s arrival - at minimum - would mean something has to give.\n\nGWS previously told utility Conor Stone, who is contracted for next season, that they may delist him with the idea of redrafting him as a rookie, two sources familiar with that discussion told this masthead on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStone, 23, re-signed for two seasons in October last year after Essendon expressed interest in him.\n\nOne of those sources said the 20-gamer would be at the Giants next season.\n\nGWS may need to delist Stone and a second player if Aleer re-signs, unless they traded a player or two out, potentially in the Oliver deal.\n\nEx-Bomber Jayden Laverde will join the Giants, but will be on the rookie list, so will not take up a primary list spot.",

Had a key role at No.5 on the recent Australia A tour of India. Fergus O\u2019Neill congratulates Ollie Peake on his match-winning Sheffield Shield knock on Tuesday. Credit: Getty Images Ollie Peake (Victoria) Age: 19\n\nTests: 0\n\nIt\u2019s been a stunning 18-month rise for the son of former Victorian batter Clinton Peake. In this time, Peake played in Australia\u2019s under-19 World Cup win, made his debut for the Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League, and posted a half-century on debut in the Sheffield Shield. Then came the invite to be a development player and travel with Australia on their Test tour of Sri Lanka last February.\n\nLoading This week, the slick left-handed batter from Geelong, who describes himself as a \u201clittle scrapper\u201d, was the match-winner for Victoria in their Shield clash against reigning champions South Australia. In just his second Shield match, and fifth first-class match, Peake finished unbeaten on 70 from 147 deliveries to guide the Vics home in a testing chase of 231 at Adelaide Oval. Close Shield observers say Peake already has the game to play Test cricket, but here\u2019s a scary thought \u2013 he is still young enough to qualify for next year\u2019s Under-19 World Cup. Sam Konstas (NSW) Age: 20\n\nTests: 5\n\nThe sometimes brutal nature of sport has hit Konstas, who enthralled the cricketing world with his audacious ramp shots on debut against Jasprit Bumrah at the MCG last summer, but has since struggled to find the middle ground needed to prosper at the top level.\n\nSam Konstas, Harry Dixon and Ollie Peake after Australia claimed the ICC under-19 World Cup in South Africa last year. Credit: ICC via Getty Images Konstas has every shot in the technical \u2013 and not so technical \u2013 handbook, but when to play these strokes remains a battle. \u201cHe\u2019s got all the tools, and I think he has the ability when he wants to, to absorb pressure. And he\u2019s got the ability to put a lot of pressure back on the bowlers. He\u2019s going to have plenty of experiences, and he\u2019s going to learn from them along the way,\u201d Australian batting great Steve Smith said. A century for Australia A in India last month settled the nerves, but a double failure for NSW in the opening round of the Sheffield Shield last weekend in Perth means he is line-ball to hold his place in the team for the Ashes. Heavy hitter: Harry Dixon has based his powerful game on his idol, Australian great David Warner. Credit: Justin McManus\n\nHarry Dixon (Victoria) Age: 20\n\nTests: 0\n\nIt would be unfair to say Dixon is a bull at a gate. But he has modelled his aggressive intent on idol David Warner. Dixon has long been on the national selectors\u2019 radar. His century inside a session against England in Worcester during the Australia under-19 Ashes tour of 2023 remains a talking point in cricketing circles. While he has batted in the middle order for Victoria, coach \u2013 and former Australian opener Chris Rogers \u2013 told the Cricket Australia website he is considering shifting Dixon to an opening role. \u201cIf there\u2019s one player that Harry reminds me of, it\u2019s David Warner. He can play shots that Warner \u2013 and potentially [Travis] Head \u2013 can play,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nLoading Rogers says the similarities include Dixon\u2019s ability to hit good balls just outside off stump conventionally through cover point or more unconventionally through the leg side. Dixon missed Victoria\u2019s Shield opener against the Redbacks after being selected for the overlapping Australia A one-day series against India A, but fans should brace themselves for the hard hitting to come when he returns to local shores over the next month. Will Salzmann (NSW) Age: 21\n\nTests: 0\n\n\u201cHe definitely knows how to hit the ball,\u201d was one comment from a state talent manager, who wished to remain anonymous, to speak freely. That, clearly, was the case in Perth last weekend when, on his first class debut, the fast-bowling all-rounder cracked 43 (seven boundaries) and 72 (10 boundaries and a six) at No.7 and was named man of the match in the Blues\u2019 74-run win over WA. \u201cThere was something lurking within, and he found it in his first game; two fantastic innings,\u201d NSW coach Greg Shipperd said. On the rise: Will Salzmann began his Sheffield Shield career last weekend with man-of-the-match honours. Credit: Getty Images This continued Salzmann\u2019s strong pre-season form, including a century against Victoria in a scratch match in Sydney. While he was given just the one over with the ball in Perth, he will have plenty of opportunity to shine this summer. Hailing from the Campbelltown Camden District Cricket Association, and representing Sydney University in Premier cricket, Salzmann was part of the Australian side that finished third at the 2022 under-19 World Cup, taking 12 wickets in six games, the most of any Australian.\n\nInjury impacted his 2024-25 season, but he has enjoyed a taste of state white-ball cricket in recent seasons, with the Blues now looking to him to be a consistent threat in all formats. \u201cI am really proud of how I have responded physically and the big off-season I have had, but also mentally, tapping into the people in my corner and learning to mature on and off the field. I have high red-ball desires,\u201d Salzmann said. Hugh Weibgen (Queensland) Age: 20\n\nTests: 0\n\nUsman Khawaja, a teammate of Weibgen\u2019s at the Valley District Cricket Club, has said he expects \u201cbig things\u201d from the dashing right-hander, and that\u2019s starting to show.\n\nWhile he was captain of Australia\u2019s victorious under-19 side at last year\u2019s World Cup in South Africa, and was named captain and No.3 in the team of the tournament with an average of 50.66, Weibgen was made to wait by the Bulls\u2019 selectors. Hugh Weibgen celebrates taking a catch for the Sydney Thunder last summer. Credit: Getty Images But no more. For those who witnessed his maiden unbeaten century (115 not out from 94 deliveries) to lift the Bulls to a two-wicket win over WA in their one-day match at Allan Border Field last month, there was a feeling he is destined for higher honours \u2013 and soon. \u201cHe\u2019s, obviously, a very good young leader, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to come into it at some stage. I would love him to be captain in two or three years\u2019 time for Queensland,\u201d Bulls coach Johan Botha said. Having spent the northern summer playing in the Surrey Premier League, Weibgen was handed his first-class debut last weekend, lashing 39 off 41 balls as the Bulls crushed Tasmania.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Bima, Indonesia: When he died in a fall at the age of 12, Arjun Bimantara was already a racing veteran. His father had been a jockey. So had his uncles and grandfather. At the age of five or six, it seemed right to the boy and his family that he would start as a jockey too. A natural rider, owners threw contracts at him so big that he bought his own horse for $1000, more than many adults in the Indonesian city of Bima \u2013 on the sparse island of Sumbawa \u2013 could hope to save in their lives. His nest-egg paid for his mother to go through university. Child jockey Arjun Bimantara was aged 12 died when he died after a fall in 2023. Credit: Amilia Rosa In half a lifetime spent rounding the crude, dirt tracks of West Nusa Tenggara province, Arjun had come off his horses \u201cmany times\u201d, his grandfather and mentor, Abdul Malik, says. At full gallop and without a saddle, bodies can slide off. In the suffocating tropical heat, small hands clenching manes and reins can lose their grip. \u201cHe just fell,\u201d Malik says. \u201cThere was no other horse or person to blame.\u201d Usually, Arjun bounded up and got back on his horse. This time he could not move. Malik ran onto the Bima track, cradling his grandson and urging him to speak. Arjun was slipping in and out of consciousness by the time they reached hospital. Rousing himself, he told everyone he felt no pain and wanted to go home. Ten minutes later, he was dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was August 13, 2023, when Arjun became the third boy jockey in four years to die in a fall on Sumbawa island. The total is now five, after the deaths of eight-year-old Febiansyah Putra in May 2024 and seven-year-old Muhamad Iswan in March. \u201cSo much as looking at this beautiful photo makes me cry,\u201d Malik says, clutching his best portrait of Arjun staring confidently into the camera. \u201cNo matter what, no other grandchild [of mine] will be a jockey. I lost Arjun on a racehorse, and Arjun will be the last.\u201d Abdul Malik with a photo of his late grandson, Arjun. Credit: Amilia Rosa In the pockets of Indonesia where horseracing remains wildly popular, some jockeys start riding even younger than Arjun. Once, Malik says, he saw a little boy climb off a racehorse to feed on his mother\u2019s breast. There are no weight handicaps or restrictions. The lighter the jockey, the better the horse\u2019s advantage. The children wear helmets, vests and kneepads. Forget about saddles. Kilograms equal centimetres. The money is big, and so is the workload. At a multiday carnival, the pool of boys might be a couple of dozen for 700 or more horses. They are often the breadwinners for their families, catapulting their parents and siblings from poverty to wealth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Stop Child Jockeys Coalition, a collection of more than 10 civil society organisations, the horse owners are \u201cmostly government officials, police and military personnel, businesspeople, council members, and bank employees\u201d. It is barbarous, exploitation and illegal, says the coalition. The racing crowd on Sumbawa calls it tradition. The barrier gates fly open for the first of the grand finals at the Bima Mayor\u2019s Cup. Credit: Amilia Rosa A lucrative game One of the premier events on the racing calendar in West Nusa Tenggara is the Bima Mayor\u2019s Cup, a 10-day knockout-style carnival put on by the city government with prizes of cows, motorbikes and a total pot of about $50,000. This masthead is trackside for the final two days, mingling with the punters crammed into bamboo grandstands and pressing against crumbling fences. At the barrier gates, army men whip the shins of youngsters crowding too close. The kids flee in excited yips of pain, then creep back like a returning tide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrugs for the horses are on open display. Haris, a pharmacist, will make about $3000 at the carnival. \u201cEvery single horse is medicated,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes them more energetic.\u201d A collection of drugs available for horses before they race. The injections make them more \u201cenergetic\u201d. Credit: Amilia Rosa Never mind that gambling is illegal in Indonesia. Men and boys wave notes of rupiah, looking for takers on their bets. One teenager with a mischievous smile confides that he gets his money from his mum for snacks. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know that I gamble.\u201d The betting and absence of any meaningful oversight to ensure integrity leads to race-fixing and \u201csabotage\u201d. Between races, a fight almost breaks out among a crowd of men because of such an accusation. Military members and government officials see everything, and do nothing. With no weight handicaps or restrictions, the lighter the jockey, the bigger the advantage. Credit: Amilia Rosa The proud family of Sandi, a winning jockey in one of the penultimate day\u2019s heats atop Queen Sahara, presents him as nine years old. It is not convincing. Minutes after flying around the track to glory on a powerful racehorse, Sandi is so shy at the attention he buries his frightened face into his mother\u2019s waist and refuses to let go of her shirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes she get worried about her son? No. \u201cHis father was a jockey, and he is fine. His brother was also a jockey, and he is fine,\u201d she says. \u201cSandi has been doing this for two years without any problems.\u201d Sandi soon after riding Queen Sahara to victory. Credit: Amilia Rosa A child comes off his horse in a cloud of dust. Dozens of people rush to his aid. The excitable race caller warns against taking photos and videos. The boy walks away, shaken and bruised, perhaps, but otherwise unharmed. \u201cI\u2019m aware of the five deaths, and I\u2019m very concerned,\u201d Saiful, the father of a 10-year-old jockey named Sahban, says. \u201cI would rather that he didn\u2019t ride. I believe I can sufficiently provide for the family without Sahban, but he is very insistent. He is proud and he is good. He is proud of the financial gain for our family.\u201d Child jockey Sahban, 10, insists on riding, his father says. Credit: Amilia Rosa Some jockeys are paid per ride, starting from about $10. Others are booked on contracts worth $600, plus bonuses for the duration of a carnival. Jockeys could have multiple contracts per carnival.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Former Wallabies captain turned senator David Pocock had been kicked out of the parliamentary sports club for raising concerns about the gambling lobby.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe independent senator has been critical of the Australian Parliament Sports Club for registering as a lobby group, with many MPs who play unaware of its status.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe club hosts friendly games between MPs, their staff, public servants and journalists during parliament sitting weeks and organises pollies versus press games across multiple sports.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Pocock said he raised concerns with the club's CEO Andy Turnbull before going public, including over the gambling lobby's sponsorship.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurnbull has denied lobbying takes place on the field and says the club was registered as a precaution to be on the safe side, given it brings together MPs and corporate sponsors.\n\n\n\nTurnbull said he would deregister the club following written confirmation from the department it did not need to be registered.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Senator Pocock raised concerns that it should be registered \"if there are paying corporate members who interact with parliamentarians\".\n\n\n\n'You left me with no choice'\n\nTurnbull messaged Senator Pocock on Thursday evening to say \"clearly based on your actions this week you have chosen to ignore my comments above\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You have chosen not to do that and in doing so have become the first person ever to politicise the most apolitical operation in the parliament,\" he said in the message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have for the last 24 hours just scratched my head in disbelief. It is inappropriate for you to remain a member of the club in these circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You chose a cheap shot that will have no effect on the outcome of your anti-gambling campaign. I am sorry it has reached this point but you left me with no choice.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Fears new breed of influencers could worsen a $25 billion Australian problem\n\nSenator Pocock is among the most vocal critics of the federal government failing to respond to a landmark gambling harm inquiry that recommended phasing out online betting, an advertising ban and stopping gambling inducements.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is yet to respond to the review's recommendations more than two years later.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Mortgage offset accounts are a fixture of the housing market, allowing homeowners to pay less interest on their deposit while maintaining easy-access savings, but new research has found the system doesn't always benefit everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis published this week in the journal Economic Record has found Australia's mortgage offset system largely benefits wealthier households while leaving lower-income households worse off.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Graham, the lead researcher on the study and a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney's School of Economics, said his model, the first academic analysis of mortgage offset accounts in Australia, revealed the current system could be deepening inequality.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraham told SBS News he took on the research project because while \"everyone\" around him was discussing purchasing a house and getting a mortgage offset account, he wanted to understand whether they were \"valuable\" products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think a lot of people just take it because it's the default option that a lot of banks offer,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And then there's people who want to think about it a little bit harder and ask whether they would actually make use of the product.\"\n\n\n\nGraham said his research aimed to find out \"who was using mortgage offset accounts, who was benefiting from using them, and to what extent\".\n\n\n\nWhat is a mortgage offset account and how is it supposed to work?\n\nA mortgage offset account is a savings bank account that is linked to your home loan.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a common service offered by banks for homeowners and presents an opportunity to reduce interest on their mortgage \u2014 and about 40 per cent of Australian mortgageholders use them, according to a 2021 Reserve Bank of Australia analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nA portion of your home loan is placed in a savings account, which is free to use as a regular savings account.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you had a home loan of $500,000 and chose a $50,000 mortgage offset account, you would only pay interest on $450,000 of your home loan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The benefit of an offset is that the money in the account is just immediately available to you,\" Graham said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you had an emergency tomorrow, you can pull that money out right away and start spending it, and then you're reducing your interest costs to the mortgage too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome plans involve a one-time fee, while others have no upfront cost, but charge extra interest to your savings account .\n\n\n\nIt was this distinction that Graham wanted to investigate.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said some banks might charge a yearly fee, while others may not but instead charge slightly higher mortgage rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Others will do weird packages, which is really hard to figure out what the actual cost of this thing is,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said some people might not totally understand what they're signing up to and may not be putting enough money in their offset account to get the interest-saving benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It could be quite hard to figure it out sometimes, what you're actually paying for these things,\" he said.\n\n\n\nDenise Boyd, head of policy and campaigns at Mortgage Stress Victoria, said mortgage offset accounts could be \"quite complex\" and the onus was on banks to provide \"clear, factual information\" for consumers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, she said, it was also on the consumer to \"keep asking the questions\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You need to make sure that you've got the right instructions at the outset. If you haven't got the right instructions in place, then you lose the interest benefit. People need to know that.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does the research say about mortgage offsets?\n\nDuring his research, Graham looked at how different mortgage offset accounts impacted different kinds of loans, and found \"different pricing benefits and harms different people\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said people with the largest mortgages who had a good ability to save were the group that benefited most from offset accounts with an upfront, yearly fee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This benefits the wealthiest people because you have to have a large mortgage in the first place to make it worthwhile,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are other plans, that add a slight increase to the mortgage interest rate rather than an upfront fee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those schemes actually tend to favour lower mortgage people a little bit more,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because then if you've got a small mortgage, then you're paying less in dollars for the product. It tilts the playing field in favour of smaller mortgages, relative to large mortgages.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general, Graham's research found that the most pertinent issue was a lack of education around how to actually benefit from a mortgage offset account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many households are potentially signing up for these products without fully understanding how they work, and in some cases they may actually be worse off,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraham said it was very easy for low-income households to lose money over time because of a lack of information about how mortgage offset accounts work, and because bank accounts were \"sticky\" \u2014 once people open them, they're very unlikely to close them, even after they have ceased to be beneficial.\n\n\n\nSally Tindall, data insights director at financial comparison website Canstar, said uptake of offset accounts appeared to be on the rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a very popular product and can be beneficial because the bank reviews the amount of interest for these accounts on a daily basis, so despite the fact your savings can go up and down, it does make a difference over time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said previously, offset accounts would come with higher fees and higher interest rates compared to a redraw account, which similarly allows mortgage holders to withdraw certain sums from their mortgage.\n\n\n\n\n\nTindall said it appeared banks had recently caught on to the fact that consumers were interested in offset accounts with low interest rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, some banks don't try higher interest rates,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Previously, they might have, but there's more competition now, so it comes down to fees for whether you're getting bang for your buck, and they can vary between the banks.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBoyd said if people were unclear whether their offset was right for them, they should ask their bank.\n\n\n\n\n\nTindall said she would advise anyone with a mortgage offset account to check their rate at least once a year to ensure they were getting the best deal for their needs.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The states and territories where renters have it the best \u2014 and worst\n\nJustine Davies, a financial expert at Moneysmart, the government's online financial advice tool, said it was \"so important\" to shop around for a mortgage that works for you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don\u2019t be shy about reviewing your mortgage regularly and asking your financial institution to offer you a better deal,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Check the home loan key facts sheet for any loan you\u2019re considering \u2014 it\u2019ll show you your repayments and the total interest over the life of the loan, as well as the fees you\u2019ll pay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a red flag \u2014 some financial institutions charge an extra fee or a higher fee for having an offset account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If that\u2019s the case, you need to be confident that the amount of money you keep in your offset account is saving you more in interest than you\u2019re paying in higher costs or rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Otherwise, you could be going backwards.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also recommended comparing multiple loans before choosing one, and using the government tools like Moneysmart's mortgage calculator to work out the likely cost of your home loan over the long term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s likely to be the biggest debt you\u2019ll ever have and one of your biggest expenses. Differences in the interest rate you\u2019re charged can make thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars difference over the life of your loan,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information in this article is general in nature and is not intended as financial advice.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nFive days into grappling with the death of her six-week-old daughter Priya, her grieving mother notified her employer of 11 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe received condolences and gifts from colleagues, but her pain was compounded when her workplace cancelled her three months of pre-approved paid parental leave.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, laws have been introduced to prevent employers from immediately scrapping these entitlements when families face the tragedy of a stillbirth or death of their baby.\n\n\n\n\n\nPriya's mother cannot be identified for legal reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS has voiced some of her comments made a press conference just after the bill was introduced into federal parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My heart aches with sadness because more than anything, I wish my daughter Priya was here with me. At the same time, I feel such immense pride and joy, knowing that she's creating meaningful change for future working parents in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bill was introduced because in some circumstances some employers immediately cancelled parental leave after the death of a baby and ask parents to take annual leave instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other cases, an employee who did not have annual leave could be told to come back to work straight away.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkplace Minister Amanda Rishworth says parents shouldn't have to deal with the uncertainty of whether they will receive paid parental leave while also enduring the grief of child loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you think about the time of a stillbirth or a early infant loss, it is absolutely tragic. It is something that I can't even imagine and to have to deal with not only navigating the grief and loss, but also navigating demands to come back to work early, not have the financial security that comes with recovering from childbirth, but also grieving and loss through having that guaranteed paid parental leave is just unimaginable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPriya's parents, who advocated for the laws, met Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Ms Rishworth after the bill was introduced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is no greater way to honour my little girl than to have her name forever tied to this law - a legacy that will touch countless lives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPriya's mother also thanked the more than 32,000 ((32,378)) people who had signed baby Priya's petition calling for the bill to be introduced.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a thank you too from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a legacy of course for Priya as well that will last for other families who are going through your tragic circumstances, which must be just so difficult. During the (election) campaign we committed to this in part because of your advocacy, understanding that parents in this situation who've lost a little one need to be looked after.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare data shows six babies are stillborn every day and two die within 28 days of birth in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Rishworth says the laws will also give clarity to employers about paid parental leave policies, and benefit workplaces by retaining and attracting staff.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What this bill is really doing is making it very explicit about what the expectations are. And this is not just good for parents, but it gives absolute clarity to employers. Someone in the HR department doesn't have to wrestle about whether or not they should cancel leave and make people take other leave. This makes it explicit that you are able to keep taking your entitlement of paid parental leave until it's exhausted. And so that really does give certainty to everyone irrespective of whether the baby was stillborn, passed away or indeed of course lived.\"\n\n\n\n",

Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe Giants are happy to bring the 24-year-old defender back to the club, but they will need to do some re-jigging to fit him in, given the league\u2019s list rules. There is also a chance another team emerges as an Aleer suitor.\n\nAFL clubs can have between 36 and 38 players on their primary list, and GWS are already at 35 before trading for Melbourne midfielder Clayton Oliver or potentially re-signing Aleer.\n\nThe challenge for the Giants is they must make at least three national draft selections, so Oliver\u2019s arrival - at minimum - would mean something has to give.\n\nGWS previously told utility Conor Stone, who is contracted for next season, that they may delist him with the idea of redrafting him as a rookie, two sources familiar with that discussion told this masthead on the condition of anonymity.\n\nStone, 23, re-signed for two seasons in October last year after Essendon expressed interest in him.\n\nOne of those sources said the 20-gamer would be at the Giants next season.\n\nGWS may need to delist Stone and a second player if Aleer re-signs, unless they traded a player or two out, potentially in the Oliver deal.\n\nEx-Bomber Jayden Laverde will join the Giants, but will be on the rookie list, so will not take up a primary list spot.",

Had a key role at No.5 on the recent Australia A tour of India. Fergus O\u2019Neill congratulates Ollie Peake on his match-winning Sheffield Shield knock on Tuesday. Credit: Getty Images Ollie Peake (Victoria) Age: 19\n\nTests: 0\n\nIt\u2019s been a stunning 18-month rise for the son of former Victorian batter Clinton Peake. In this time, Peake played in Australia\u2019s under-19 World Cup win, made his debut for the Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League, and posted a half-century on debut in the Sheffield Shield. Then came the invite to be a development player and travel with Australia on their Test tour of Sri Lanka last February.\n\nLoading This week, the slick left-handed batter from Geelong, who describes himself as a \u201clittle scrapper\u201d, was the match-winner for Victoria in their Shield clash against reigning champions South Australia. In just his second Shield match, and fifth first-class match, Peake finished unbeaten on 70 from 147 deliveries to guide the Vics home in a testing chase of 231 at Adelaide Oval. Close Shield observers say Peake already has the game to play Test cricket, but here\u2019s a scary thought \u2013 he is still young enough to qualify for next year\u2019s Under-19 World Cup. Sam Konstas (NSW) Age: 20\n\nTests: 5\n\nThe sometimes brutal nature of sport has hit Konstas, who enthralled the cricketing world with his audacious ramp shots on debut against Jasprit Bumrah at the MCG last summer, but has since struggled to find the middle ground needed to prosper at the top level.\n\nSam Konstas, Harry Dixon and Ollie Peake after Australia claimed the ICC under-19 World Cup in South Africa last year. Credit: ICC via Getty Images Konstas has every shot in the technical \u2013 and not so technical \u2013 handbook, but when to play these strokes remains a battle. \u201cHe\u2019s got all the tools, and I think he has the ability when he wants to, to absorb pressure. And he\u2019s got the ability to put a lot of pressure back on the bowlers. He\u2019s going to have plenty of experiences, and he\u2019s going to learn from them along the way,\u201d Australian batting great Steve Smith said. A century for Australia A in India last month settled the nerves, but a double failure for NSW in the opening round of the Sheffield Shield last weekend in Perth means he is line-ball to hold his place in the team for the Ashes. Heavy hitter: Harry Dixon has based his powerful game on his idol, Australian great David Warner. Credit: Justin McManus\n\nHarry Dixon (Victoria) Age: 20\n\nTests: 0\n\nIt would be unfair to say Dixon is a bull at a gate. But he has modelled his aggressive intent on idol David Warner. Dixon has long been on the national selectors\u2019 radar. His century inside a session against England in Worcester during the Australia under-19 Ashes tour of 2023 remains a talking point in cricketing circles. While he has batted in the middle order for Victoria, coach \u2013 and former Australian opener Chris Rogers \u2013 told the Cricket Australia website he is considering shifting Dixon to an opening role. \u201cIf there\u2019s one player that Harry reminds me of, it\u2019s David Warner. He can play shots that Warner \u2013 and potentially [Travis] Head \u2013 can play,\u201d Rogers said.\n\nLoading Rogers says the similarities include Dixon\u2019s ability to hit good balls just outside off stump conventionally through cover point or more unconventionally through the leg side. Dixon missed Victoria\u2019s Shield opener against the Redbacks after being selected for the overlapping Australia A one-day series against India A, but fans should brace themselves for the hard hitting to come when he returns to local shores over the next month. Will Salzmann (NSW) Age: 21\n\nTests: 0\n\n\u201cHe definitely knows how to hit the ball,\u201d was one comment from a state talent manager, who wished to remain anonymous, to speak freely. That, clearly, was the case in Perth last weekend when, on his first class debut, the fast-bowling all-rounder cracked 43 (seven boundaries) and 72 (10 boundaries and a six) at No.7 and was named man of the match in the Blues\u2019 74-run win over WA. \u201cThere was something lurking within, and he found it in his first game; two fantastic innings,\u201d NSW coach Greg Shipperd said. On the rise: Will Salzmann began his Sheffield Shield career last weekend with man-of-the-match honours. Credit: Getty Images This continued Salzmann\u2019s strong pre-season form, including a century against Victoria in a scratch match in Sydney. While he was given just the one over with the ball in Perth, he will have plenty of opportunity to shine this summer. Hailing from the Campbelltown Camden District Cricket Association, and representing Sydney University in Premier cricket, Salzmann was part of the Australian side that finished third at the 2022 under-19 World Cup, taking 12 wickets in six games, the most of any Australian.\n\nInjury impacted his 2024-25 season, but he has enjoyed a taste of state white-ball cricket in recent seasons, with the Blues now looking to him to be a consistent threat in all formats. \u201cI am really proud of how I have responded physically and the big off-season I have had, but also mentally, tapping into the people in my corner and learning to mature on and off the field. I have high red-ball desires,\u201d Salzmann said. Hugh Weibgen (Queensland) Age: 20\n\nTests: 0\n\nUsman Khawaja, a teammate of Weibgen\u2019s at the Valley District Cricket Club, has said he expects \u201cbig things\u201d from the dashing right-hander, and that\u2019s starting to show.\n\nWhile he was captain of Australia\u2019s victorious under-19 side at last year\u2019s World Cup in South Africa, and was named captain and No.3 in the team of the tournament with an average of 50.66, Weibgen was made to wait by the Bulls\u2019 selectors. Hugh Weibgen celebrates taking a catch for the Sydney Thunder last summer. Credit: Getty Images But no more. For those who witnessed his maiden unbeaten century (115 not out from 94 deliveries) to lift the Bulls to a two-wicket win over WA in their one-day match at Allan Border Field last month, there was a feeling he is destined for higher honours \u2013 and soon. \u201cHe\u2019s, obviously, a very good young leader, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to come into it at some stage. I would love him to be captain in two or three years\u2019 time for Queensland,\u201d Bulls coach Johan Botha said. Having spent the northern summer playing in the Surrey Premier League, Weibgen was handed his first-class debut last weekend, lashing 39 off 41 balls as the Bulls crushed Tasmania.",

His nest-egg paid for his mother to go through university. Child jockey Arjun Bimantara was aged 12 died when he died after a fall in 2023. Credit: Amilia Rosa In half a lifetime spent rounding the crude, dirt tracks of West Nusa Tenggara province, Arjun had come off his horses \u201cmany times\u201d, his grandfather and mentor, Abdul Malik, says. At full gallop and without a saddle, bodies can slide off. In the suffocating tropical heat, small hands clenching manes and reins can lose their grip. \u201cHe just fell,\u201d Malik says. \u201cThere was no other horse or person to blame.\u201d Usually, Arjun bounded up and got back on his horse. This time he could not move. Malik ran onto the Bima track, cradling his grandson and urging him to speak. Arjun was slipping in and out of consciousness by the time they reached hospital. Rousing himself, he told everyone he felt no pain and wanted to go home. Ten minutes later, he was dead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was August 13, 2023, when Arjun became the third boy jockey in four years to die in a fall on Sumbawa island. The total is now five, after the deaths of eight-year-old Febiansyah Putra in May 2024 and seven-year-old Muhamad Iswan in March. \u201cSo much as looking at this beautiful photo makes me cry,\u201d Malik says, clutching his best portrait of Arjun staring confidently into the camera. \u201cNo matter what, no other grandchild [of mine] will be a jockey. I lost Arjun on a racehorse, and Arjun will be the last.\u201d Abdul Malik with a photo of his late grandson, Arjun. Credit: Amilia Rosa In the pockets of Indonesia where horseracing remains wildly popular, some jockeys start riding even younger than Arjun. Once, Malik says, he saw a little boy climb off a racehorse to feed on his mother\u2019s breast. There are no weight handicaps or restrictions. The lighter the jockey, the better the horse\u2019s advantage. The children wear helmets, vests and kneepads. Forget about saddles. Kilograms equal centimetres. The money is big, and so is the workload. At a multiday carnival, the pool of boys might be a couple of dozen for 700 or more horses. They are often the breadwinners for their families, catapulting their parents and siblings from poverty to wealth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the Stop Child Jockeys Coalition, a collection of more than 10 civil society organisations, the horse owners are \u201cmostly government officials, police and military personnel, businesspeople, council members, and bank employees\u201d. It is barbarous, exploitation and illegal, says the coalition. The racing crowd on Sumbawa calls it tradition. The barrier gates fly open for the first of the grand finals at the Bima Mayor\u2019s Cup.

This masthead is trackside for the final two days, mingling with the punters crammed into bamboo grandstands and pressing against crumbling fences. At the barrier gates, army men whip the shins of youngsters crowding too close. The kids flee in excited yips of pain, then creep back like a returning tide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDrugs for the horses are on open display. Haris, a pharmacist, will make about $3000 at the carnival. \u201cEvery single horse is medicated,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes them more energetic.\u201d A collection of drugs available for horses before they race. The injections make them more \u201cenergetic\u201d. Credit: Amilia Rosa Never mind that gambling is illegal in Indonesia. Men and boys wave notes of rupiah, looking for takers on their bets. One teenager with a mischievous smile confides that he gets his money from his mum for snacks. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know that I gamble.\u201d The betting and absence of any meaningful oversight to ensure integrity leads to race-fixing and \u201csabotage\u201d. Between races, a fight almost breaks out among a crowd of men because of such an accusation. Military members and government officials see everything, and do nothing. With no weight handicaps or restrictions, the lighter the jockey, the bigger the advantage.

Minutes after flying around the track to glory on a powerful racehorse, Sandi is so shy at the attention he buries his frightened face into his mother\u2019s waist and refuses to let go of her shirt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoes she get worried about her son? No. \u201cHis father was a jockey, and he is fine. His brother was also a jockey, and he is fine,\u201d she says. \u201cSandi has been doing this for two years without any problems.\u201d Sandi soon after riding Queen Sahara to victory.

The boy walks away, shaken and bruised, perhaps, but otherwise unharmed. \u201cI\u2019m aware of the five deaths, and I\u2019m very concerned,\u201d Saiful, the father of a 10-year-old jockey named Sahban, says. \u201cI would rather that he didn\u2019t ride. I believe I can sufficiently provide for the family without Sahban, but he is very insistent. He is proud and he is good. He is proud of the financial gain for our family.\u201d Child jockey Sahban, 10, insists on riding, his father says. Credit: Amilia Rosa Some jockeys are paid per ride, starting from about $10. Others are booked on contracts worth $600, plus bonuses for the duration of a carnival. Jockeys could have multiple contracts per carnival.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "The harmful practice of child marriage is under scrutiny ahead of International Day of the Girl.\n\nAustralians are being urged to use the day - October 11 - to reflect on outdated cultural norms, values and gender stereotypes that contribute to inequality.\n\nAround the world, 12 million girls under the age of 18 are married each year, which equates to one almost every three seconds.\n\nWhile early and child marriage affects both girls and boys, the impact on girls is much greater and those who grow up in poverty or living through a crisis, conflict or disaster are particularly at risk.\n\nFormer AFLW player Akec Makur Chuot's sister was forced into marriage at 15. (Maeve Bannister/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nFor Akec Makur Chuot, the topic is deeply personal.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe former AFLW player grew up in a Kenyan refugee camp, where she lived for 12 years before settling in Perth.\n\nHer sister, who remained in Kenya, was forced into marriage at 15 to a much older man.\n\n\"People think it's a foreign thing that happens overseas, but it's happening in our community,\" Makur Chuot said.\n\n\"It happened in South Sudan, but I was obviously in Australia, and it affected me because I knew that (my sister) was a young girl who had a lot of dreams, just like millions of girls who have been forcibly married off at such a young age.\"\n\nInternational Day of the Girl, celebrated on October 11, aims to spotlight the potential of girls around the world and the barriers they can face to freedom, safety, justice, health and education.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis year's theme brings attention to child marriage, which remains widespread despite large-scale policy action and legislative reform.\n\nA report by Plan International Australia surveyed more than 250 girls aged 15 to 24 who married as children, as well as activists working to eradicate child marriage.\n\nThe study, conducted across 15 nations, found 66 per cent of child brides had dropped out of school and 75 per cent were unemployed.\n\nAustralians need to tackle outdated ideas that fuel gender inequality, Susanne Legena says. (PR IMAGE PHOTO)\n\n\"Something that really struck me is the girls we spoke to talked about being very isolated,\" Plan International Australia chief executive Susanne Legena told AAP.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"They miss their friends. They're young girls (and) they're living in societies and cultures where the only status you have as a woman is to be married or to have children.\"\n\nWhile child marriage was illegal in Australia, Ms Legena said the nation's girls still faced other forms of gender inequality.\n\n\"The norms, the values, those gender stereotypes, the dismissive views of girls and what they can be, they exist in Australia,\" she said.\n\n\"We have to tackle that attitude here as well. It doesn't manifest in child marriage, but it does manifest in sexual harassment, gender inequality and gender-based violence.\"\n\nGovernor-General Sam Mostyn has been dedicated to gender equality, social justice and child rights.
