(Supplied)\n\nMazitelli had just finished a 30-year career in mining in Queensland's north and finally wanted to enjoy the fruits of his back-breaking labour.\n\n\"I turned 60, wanted to retire and spend a bit of money on myself,\" Mazitelli told 9news.com.au .\n\n\"In 2023 I was online and I saw this advertisement which said 'you can improve your super', I filled out a form and before I knew it I got a call.\"\n\nDo you have a story? Contact reporter April Glover at april.glover@nine.com.au\n\nMazitelli was told he'd be able to secure his retirement with better returns, so he transferred his money to Australian Practical Super, known as AusPrac.\n\nHe heard nothing more and assumed everything was OK.\n\nAfter a year, it was time for Mazitelli to hang up his boots and retire.\n\nHe had a healthy nest egg of just over $240,000 to enjoy in his twilight years.\n\nWhen he went to pull it out, the nightmare began.\n\nHe couldn't access a single cent.\n\n\"Then I saw that First Guardian had gone into liquidation and my money had been frozen,\" Mazitelli said.\n\nLike many Australians stung by First Guardian's collapse, Mazitelli said he'd never heard of this fund.\n\nThe former mining worker said he wanted to retire at 60 but had to pause his plans. (Supplied)\n\nAround 6000 people who are missing some or all of their superannuation after the collapse of First Guardian Master Trust, which went into liquidation and is under investigation by corporate regulator ASIC.\n\nASIC began investigating First Guardian's responsible entity Falcon Capital and First Guardian.\n\nAusPrac, also known as Australian Practical Superannuation, is operated by parent company Sequoia Financial Group.\n\nDiversa is the trustee for AusPrac.\n\nIn a statement to impacted members, Diversa said it understands AusPrac members who invested in a First Guardian Master Fund may be experiencing \"stress, anxiety and feelings of uncertainty in response to significant financial losses\".\n\n9news.com.au has contacted Sequoia for comment but is yet to receive a reply.\n\nNine.com.au is not suggesting any wrongdoing by AusPrac.\ufeff\n\nThe long and complicated process of trying to win back even a fraction of Mazitelli's nest egg has been going on for 12 months.\n\nRetirement is now out of the question and he has been forced to return to work as a truck driver.\n\nHe's looking at another 10 years of work at the very least.\ufeff\n\nThe emotional burden of losing his financial freedom has taken a toll too.\n\nMazitelli is now among 12,000 Australians waiting for answers. (Supplied)\n\n\"If I make it to 70\u2026 that's probably how long I'll be working,\" he said.\n\n\"My life has now changed because I wanted to get away and do stuff, I can't anymore. It's had a huge impact.\n\n\"At my age I shouldn't cry but I do, I am angry a lot\u2026 now it's just each day wondering and hoping for a resolution.\"\n\nMazitelli has joined a Facebook group of 1300-strong people who have also lost their superannuation.\n\nAround 12,000 Australians are missing a combined total of $1.2 billion after the collapse of First Guardian and Shield Master Trust.\n\nMembers of the group are supporting and counselling each other as the ASIC investigation takes place.\n\nVictims of both collapses are demanding government action \u2013 and fast.\n\n\"The government needs to intervene now\u2026 to safeguard and watch every superannuation fund so that this doesn't happen to anyone else,\" Mazitelli said.\n\n\"We are all just normal and hardworking Australians who did nothing wrong.\"\n\nHundreds of victims have lodged complaints with The Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA).\n\nMazitelli has contacted his local member Andrew Wilcox, the MP for Dawson in north Queensland, who said he will advocate on his behalf.\n\nA Change.org petition has also been started to ask the government to establish a victims' trust.\ufeff\n\nASIC's full statement\n\nASIC has an ongoing investigation in relation to First Guardian Master Fund and Falcon Capital.\n\nFollowing concerns raised by ASIC, the Federal Court appointed liquidators to Falcon Capital and ordered the wind-up of First Guardian and its related funds in April.\n\nThe court also restrained David Anderson, a director of Falcon, from dealing with his assets and appointed a receiver to his personal property.\n\nASIC's investigation suggests that potential consumers were called and referred to personal financial advice providers who advised consumers to roll their superannuation assets into a retail choice superannuation fund, and then to invest part or all of their superannuation into First Guardian.\n\nWhile ASIC's investigation is ongoing, the Federal Court has made interim travel restraint orders against Falcon Capital director David Anderson on ASIC's application. The Court also made interim orders freezing the assets of another Falcon director, Simon Selimaj and restraining his travel.\n\nThose orders are in place until 27 February 2026. We understand the circumstances surrounding First Guardian are distressing for those affected and it is one of ASIC's priorities to investigate what has happened and to preserve as much of investors' funds as possible while our investigation is continuing.\n\nSo far, ASIC has had more than 40 court appearances on matters related to First Guardian and Shield. We have taken a range of enforcement action with respect to these matters including:\n\nstop orders to prevent ongoing consumer harm,\n\ncommencing court proceedings to preserve assets and restrict travel of persons of interest,\n\nappoint receivers and liquidators with the aim of securing investor funds\n\nexecuting numerous search warrants with the assistance of the Australian Federal Police.\n\ncancelled licences and banned certain financial advisers.",

        "text": "The TV cliffhanger has been a dying art for almost a decade now, but Australia's teen social media ban is single-handedly reviving it.\n\nQuestions as to how the saga will end have been piling up since episode one last November, when parliament passed a law to purge under-16s from major platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat.\n\nLike any good TV drama, it's produced its share of intrigue \u2014 which platforms will actually be covered? What's a VPN? And how do the Wiggles feel about it?\n\nThe reply all along has been \"stay tuned\", and those who've done so have been drip-fed some of the answers, to varying levels of completion, in a drawn-out series of nail-biting instalments.\n\nThe political backflip of Olympic proportions Photo shows A blue background with images of Anthony Albanese, the YouTube logo and downward thumbs on top The government's announcement this week that YouTube would be included in the teen social media ban is a political backflip of Olympic proportions, and its first since the election. They pulled it off with surprising grace, but no landing is perfect, writes Ange Lavoipierre.\n\nWhich platforms will be covered by the ban? We still don't have an exhaustive list, but it's most of the big ones you can name, including YouTube!\n\nSluggish mid-season ratings perked up with the bombshell reveal that age-checking technology isn't always as accurate as hoped \u2014 especially if you're close to 16 years old and not a white male.\n\nBut with less than three months to go, the season's biggest mystery remains unsolved: how will social media companies actually check who's over 16?\n\nNot all under-16 accounts will disappear on December 10, the e-safety commissioner says. (ABC News: Declan Bowring)\n\nThe latest cliffhanger\n\nMany loyal viewers had high expectations that the answer would become clear in this week's episode, with eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant unveiling long-awaited regulatory guidelines, but there was no big reveal in the end.\n\nRather than giving a concrete list of acceptable age-checking methods, Inman Grant announced a \"principles-based approach\", stating that age-checking systems should be \"reliable, accurate, robust and effective\".\n\nHow exactly the platforms go about the messy business of testing their users' ages \u2014 scanning faces, checking IDs, using third-party data from an app store, or making an educated guess based on users' online activity, to name a few options \u2014 will be up to the companies themselves.\n\nAge-checking tech for social media ban mistakes kids for 37-year-olds Photo shows A video stream on a laptop, showing a women with green lines and dots all over her face Children as young as 15 were repeatedly misidentified as being in their 20s and 30s during government tests of age-checking tools, sowing new doubts about whether the teen social media ban is viable.\n\nAddressing the media on Tuesday, the commissioner seemed aware her audience might have been expecting something less vague.\n\n\"It may be a surprise to some that the guidance does not mandate a single technology approach \u2026 or set a required accuracy rating for age estimation,\" Inman Grant acknowledged.\n\nWhat did emerge, though, was a clear expectation that social media companies provide Australians with more than one way to demonstrate their age \u2014 a so-called \"waterfall approach\", where ID is never the only option.\n\nAnd apparently, no-one is expecting perfection.\n\n\"We don't expect that every under-16 account is going to disappear on December 10,\" Inman Grant said.\n\n\"What we will be looking at is systemic failures.\"\n\nAustralia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant revealed guidelines on Tuesday. (AAP: Lukas Coach)\n\nThe exact definition of \"systemic failures\" is yet another mystery.\n\nIt's unclear just how \"reliable, accurate, robust and effective\" age-checking methods will need to be in order to avoid attracting a $50 million fine, with no firm thresholds set out.\n\nIn any case, eSafety will be marking homework.\n\nThe regulator will have the power to force companies to hand over internal data as part of compliance checks, such as reports on how many young people they've kicked off their platform.\n\nThe big reveal? An educated guess may be good enough in many cases\n\nIf there was a big reveal in this episode, it might have been that social media companies won't need to ask everyone's ages \u2014 in many cases, an educated guess will do.\n\nIn technical terms, an educated guess as to a person's age is known as \"age inference\", and the eSafety Commissioner's new guidelines suggest it may figure much more prominently in the final shape of the policy than anyone initially imagined.\n\n\"Existing data may be sufficient to satisfy providers that the account holder is over the age of 16,\" the guidance states.\n\nLandmark study of age verification warns of risks Photo shows An iPhone screen The study, which will inform the government's impending social media ban for under-16s, found several methods were viable, but no method was foolproof, with concerns over both accuracy and privacy.\n\nAt the more sophisticated end of the spectrum, age inference can be remarkably accurate, drawing on a range of behavioural signals and contextual data, rather than face scanning or government-issued ID.\n\nAn age inference system might consider how long an account has existed, the interests and personal networks of the user, the content of their posts, or even analyse their voice and use of language.\n\nPut simply, if all your friends are 13, you speak and write like a 13-year-old, and your online activity drops off during school hours, a social media platform might ask you to prove your age.\n\nOn the other hand, if you've had an account since 2007, your friends are all in their 40s and you're a member of several online parenting communities, you might not ever hear from them.\n\nA key appeal of age inference, according to eSafety, is that no extra data is required from the user, making the whole experience \"frictionless\".\n\nSocial media platforms may use age inference, drawing on a range of behavioural signals and contextual data, rather than face scanning or government-issued ID. (ABC News: Will Ockenden )\n\nGranted, it's probably not the best way to tell a 15-year-old from a 17-year-old, but it might be enough to keep the majority of Australian adults from even noticing that the social media ban has come into force.\n\nThere's a certain irony to the fact that, amidst all the anxious guessing brought on by the shortage of policy detail over the last 10 months, very few people guessed at this ending.\n\nOf course, we can't know how heavily social media companies will lean on this option, but we do know it's already a common in-house practice for many of them.\n\nIt's also safe to assume companies will want to avoid any unnecessary headaches for themselves or users come December, and with eSafety's conditional green light, age inference will be all the more enticing now.\n\nSpeaking alongside Inman Grant this week, Communications Minister Annika Wells said platforms \"know an awful lot about us\" already, and millions of Australians could be about to learn exactly how much.\n\nBut until the season finale rolls around on December 10, it's all an educated guess.",

        "text": "The proposed Macquarie Point AFL stadium in Hobart should not proceed, a long-awaited assessment from the Tasmanian Planning Commission (TPC) has recommended.\n\nThe final report finds that the stadium would \"diminish the economic welfare\" of Tasmania, the government's cost-benefit remains significantly overestimated, and it would have an \"irrevocable and unacceptable\" impact on Hobart's landscape.\n\nIt estimates that the government would need to accumulate $1 billion in debt for construction costs, which would rise to $1.8 billion over 10 years, and taxes would need to increase $50 million per year over 30 years.\n\nThe report states the construction cost equates to $5,900 per Tasmanian household not reliant on Commonwealth income support.\n\nLive Moment Premier Jeremy Rockliff has responded to the Tasmanian Planning Commission's report. That's where we'll leave the live coverage Our story will continue to be updated as more reactions to the report come in. Stay tuned for further coverage as well, including a deep dive into the reasons the planning commission rejected the stadium. Stadium opponent group Our Place says report should be 'final nail in the coffin' Our Place spokesperson Roland Browne says the report makes clear the stadium should no proceed. He also calls on Mr Rockliff to resign. \"The TPC report should be the final nail in the coffin for a project that has no majority public support, will bankrupt the state, and is a desecration of the Hobart Cenotaph and Sullivans Cove. \"It's time for the Liberal and Labor parties to start listening to the experts and the community, and abandon their obsession with this stadium. \"The Minister ought not make any recommendation to the Governor; this project should lay where it has fallen. \"And if the government is silly enough to press on, the parliament should reject it out of hand. It has nothing going for it. It represents a triumph of vanity over sensible government. It is a recipe for massive state debt and ongoing community division.\" Premier shuts down talk of alternative stadium proposals Mr Rockliff is asked about the so-called 'stadium 2.0' proposal from a different developer for the Regatta Grounds area not so far from Macquarie Point. Journalist: What are the chances you'll consider a whole new proposal for the Hobart stadium, and should 2.0 be revived? Premier: No. 2.0 is not going to happen. That's all from the premier. Show more\n\nThe report provided a $974 million upfront construction cost, including car park, buses, lifecycle costs and state subsidy for the Tasmania Devils AFL club, while Premier Jeremy Rockliff said the government's latest total estimate is $1.13 billion.\n\nThe cost-benefit ratio is less than 0.5, meaning that for every $1 spent, less than a 50-cent direct benefit will be returned.\n\n\"The proponent's cost-benefit analysis prepared by KPMG and released in September 2024, shows a base-case benefit cost ratio of 0.69,\" the report reads.\n\n\" Since this study was undertaken, the stadium construction cost estimate has increased significantly. \"\n\nThe proposed stadium will be purpose-built to host AFL matches. (Supplied: MPDC)\n\nStadium's size is a 'fundamental problem'\n\nIn its conclusion, the report was highly critical of the planning elements of the stadium.\n\n\"The fundamental problem is the size, location and geographical features of the site, in its highly valued context, do not support the disproportionately large, monolithic building proposed,\" it reads.\n\n\"Proceeding with the project will give rise to irrevocable and unacceptable adverse impacts on Hobart's spatial and landscape character, urban form and historic cultural heritage.\n\n\"The project represents a significant net cost and will diminish the economic welfare of Tasmanians as a whole.\"\n\nThe project was assessed under the 12-month-long project of state significance (POSS) process and the recommendation comes after an interim report and public hearings.\n\nThe stadium should not proceed, the Tasmanian Planning Commission has recommended. (Supplied: MPC)\n\nThe recommendation is not binding, with Tasmania's parliament having the final say on approval for the project with a vote in both houses of parliament.\n\nThe report was critical of the stadium proponent \u2014 the state-owned Macquarie Point Development Corporation \u2014 which said that the stadium would have \"unquantifiable social benefits\".\n\nThe TPC described the measurable social benefits as \"small\".\n\nRockliff still proceeding with stadium\n\nPremier Jeremy Rockliff said the TPC report \"massively underestimates\" the social and economic benefits.\n\nHe said the findings were \"not unexpected\".\n\n\"I note that the planning report has said that this is ,\" Mr Rockliff said.\n\n\"When it comes to those matters that were concerning Tasmanians around safety, transport, and other key matters, they can all be resolved.\n\n\" We can do this. \"\n\nThe Liberal government and Labor opposition have both supported the project but the two parties would need the support of three independents in the upper house in order to proceed with the project.\n\nMr Rockliff said the government will \"make an order into the parliament\" with conditions attached, and the exact process will be made \"very clear in the not too distant future\".\n\n\"We need to get this done this year,\" he said.\n\nThe stadium is a requirement under the AFL's contract with the Tasmanian government for the state to have its own AFL men's and women's teams.\n\nThe future of the Tasmania Devils AFL club hinges on whether the stadium is built. (Supplied: Tasmania Football Club/Solstice Digital)\n\nStadium has 'divided' Tasmanians\n\nElwick independent Upper House MLC Bec Thomas \u2014 whose vote could be crucial \u2014 told ABC Radio Hobart that she hopes the government takes its time to consider the report.\n\n\"This issue has sadly really divided Tasmania, and we have an opportunity now where we have more information presented before us,\" she said.\n\n\"I really hope they will take their time in considering the information that's presented in the report, and in considering the decision of the planning commission before liaising with other members of parliament on what they do from here.\"\n\nSpokesperson for stadium opposition group Our Place, Roland Browne, said the report should be the end of the stadium.\n\n\"The TPC report should be the final nail in the coffin for a project that has no majority public support, will bankrupt the state, and is a desecration of the Hobart Cenotaph and Sullivans Cove,\" he said.\n\n\"It's time for the Liberal and Labor parties to start listening to the experts and the community, and abandon their obsession with this stadium.\"\n\nThe Tasmanian Planning Commission's conclusion:",

Isabelle Kelly was meant to rest up for a few weeks after suffering an oral fracture that nearly cost her several teeth, but the Roosters skipper missed just one match and has now returned to lead the club's premiership charge.\n\nBoth teams are one win away from facing off in a grand final for the third time after earning a first-week bye into the preliminary finals in the league's first six-team, three-week finals series.\n\nThe Tricolours are stacked with representative talent, although they will be without Maroons and Jillaroos half Tarryn Aiken for the finals, and the already elite Broncos this season welcomed star fullback Tamika Upton, who immediately topped the try-scoring with 18 in 11 games.\n\nThe third-placed Knights are still rank $26 outsiders with most bookmakers, and there have been reports this season that NSW halfback and Newcastle native Jesse Southwell has her eyes set on a move to Brisbane.\n\nBut NRL chief executive Abdo declared it was too early to make the call about whether the competition had become too top-heavy after the addition of the Bulldogs and Warriors this year.\n\n\"In any given year, you're going to have some teams that are at the top of the ladder, some teams that are at the bottom of the ladder,\" he said at the NRLW finals launch.\n\n\"Now we've got a finals series and let's see what happens.\n\n\"I think it's too early to talk about the balance of the competition because this competition is quite dynamic, continues to grow and evolve, and the quality of football and footballers is increasing.\"\n\nOnly three teams \u2014 Brisbane (2018\u201320), Sydney (2021, 2024) and Newcastle (2022\u201323) \u2014 have won the NRLW premiership since the league's first season in 2018.\n\nAnd while the men's league has similarly only had three premiers since 2017 \u2014 Storm (2017, 2020), Roosters (2018-19), Panthers (2021-24) \u2014 statistics show the gap between the bottom and top sides in the NRLW has widened this year.\n\nThe Broncos, the league's best attacking team, scored more than four times as many points as back-to-back wooden spooners Wests Tigers (404\u2013100).\n\nLast year, the best attacking side was a little more than 2.5 times better than the worst by points scored across the regular season \u2014 272 to Brisbane and 108 to the Tigers.\n\nThe average winning margin of games has also increased by almost a try, up from 14.2 points last regular season to 18 in 2025.\n\nThe NRL has previously been praised for its slow-burn approach to expansion, with the league slowly growing from four teams in 2018, to six in 2021, to 10 in 2023, before moving to the current 12-team format this year.\n\nDo you have a story idea about women in sport?

(ABC Rural: Kim Honan)\n\nBMA asset president Adam Lancey said in a statement on Wednesday the company did not want to see jobs lost, \"but these are necessary decisions in the face of the combined impact of the Queensland government's unsustainable coal royalties and market conditions\".\n\n\"The simple fact is the Queensland coal industry is approaching a crisis point,\" Mr Lancey said.\n\n\"This is now having real impacts on regional jobs, communities and small businesses.\n\n\"The uncertainty this creates for our people and our communities is not taken lightly, and we will do everything we can to support them.\"\n\nMr Lancey said all those already learning at the FutureFit Academy in Mackay would be supported to find jobs within BHP, even as its future now remains unclear.\n\nThe Saraji South Mine, formerly Norwich Park, was last mothballed by BMA in 2012 due to falling coal prices. (ABC News)\n\nBMA behaviour 'unAustralian'\n\nDeputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie said the government was \"doing everything we can\" to make sure the state supported mining businesses.\n\n\"We are not at war with the mining sector, we are approving leases and mining approvals far more efficiently and quicker,\" he said.\n\nHe called on the company to do whatever it could to protect and support its worker who were now \"going through a pretty difficult process and stage at this time\".\n\nDeputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie called on BMA to support and protect its workers. (ABC News)\n\nBut Mr Bleijie said it was \"unAustralian\" for the company to put its Mackay training centre in doubt.\n\n\"I think that is unAustralian. I think they should keep investing,\" he said.\n\n\"They have made billions of dollars from the resources owned by Queensland taxpayers and Queenslanders, and they should keep investing in the future of young people who want a job in a mine or a resource sector in Queensland.\"\n\nMining industry says coal royalties 'wildly' underestimates revenue Photo shows A bob cat machine in front of a very large pile of coal. The Queensland Resources Council wants the state to scrap its 40 per cent royalty hike on some coal exports, saying the new rates put the industry's viability at risk.\n\nMr Bleijie said his government had vowed not to tinker with the royalty regime before its election.\n\n\"We had an election commitment not to adjust the royalty regime and we've stuck by the election commitment, so it's no surprise to BHP \u2014 a multi-billion-dollar company.\n\n\"That was our commitment to the people of Queensland.\"\n\nBMA 'spreading fear' says union\n\nUnion delegates say workers at Saraji South only learned this morning of BMA's plans.\n\nMining Energy Union president Mitch Hughes said the company must consult with its people \"rather than spread fear through the media\".\n\n\"BHP should stop using coal workers and communities as pawns in its fight with the Queensland government over royalties,\" he said.\n\n\"Workers need facts, certainty and security \u2014 not alarmism.\"\n\nQueensland Opposition Leader Steven Miles said he was calling on the government to help affected workers.\n\n\"[750 workers have] lost their source of income, losing the way that they support their families, and I would just call on the government to do whatever they can to either support BHP to keep these jobs or to help those workers into other jobs,\" he said.\n\nMr Miles' former Labor government introduced the lucrative royalties for mining and petroleum, including coal, in 2022.\n\nSteven Miles says companies were not shuttering mines when the royalties first came in, only now when prices are falling. (ABC News)\n\nThe coal royalties regime's three tiers has miners paying more as coal prices go up \u2014 20 per cent at $175 per tonne, 30 per cent at $225/t and 40 per cent when prices topped $300/t.\n\nMr Miles said companies, including BMA, were not shuttering mines when the royalties first came in, but only now as markets have fallen.\n\n\"The coal price is now much lower than it has been over recent years and this didn't occur when those prices were higher, which is when those aggressive coal royalties would have kicked in more substantially,\" he said.\n\nShuttered for second time\n\nSaraji South, formerly Norwich Park, was last shuttered in 2012, affecting 400 workers, with BMA claiming the site was no longer viable.\n\nThe alliance says the state's coal industry is approaching a crisis point. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nIn 2015, plans were revealed showing that BMA was considering reopening the project, but only if it could use primarily fly-in, fly-out workers.\n\nIt was later reopened in 2020 as part of the larger Saraji precinct.\n\nThe union said the resources giant was being \"disingenuous\" by blaming royalties for the closure.\n\n\"It's very disappointing to see BHP close a mine as soon as coal prices come off the boil,\" Mr Hughes said.\n\n\" But they have form in turning this mine on and off to chase high coal prices with no regard for the community or workforce impact. \"\n\nMr Hughes accused the multinational miner of \"sulking\" after making enormous profits when coal prices were high.\n\n\"Even with higher royalties, BHP profited immensely from the coal price spike of 2022-2023 which saw coking coal spot prices peak at over $900 a tonne,\" he said.\n\n\"BHP is sulking that they had to share some of these windfall profits with Queenslanders.\"\n\nWill mining royalties 'kill the golden goose' or save towns?

(Getty Images: Sportsfile/Sam Barnes)\n\nHull appeared to be tying up badly in the closing stages, as serial champion Faith Kipyegon stormed home to claim a fourth world championship gold in the distance and Dorcus Ewoi came past to take silver.\n\nBut with Nelly Chepchirchir, who pipped Hull to the Diamond League final crown last month lurking on inside her shoulder, the Australian dug deep to hang on for bronze by less than a tenth of a second.\n\n\"I was just fighting to get to that line and hang to to a medal,\" Hull said.\n\nAnd fight she did.\n\nEven with a lap to go Hull had to fight to hold her position, a tangle of elbows earning her a fierce look from Chepchirchir, who had been trying to cut down the Australian's space.\n\nThe race got a little bit physical between Nelly Chepchirchir (left) and Jess Hull (centre). (Getty Images: Hannah Peters)\n\nAfter collapsing over the line, Hull sat on the track, head back in relief and exhaustion before Ewoi, who smashed her personal best to get into the podium, leapt onto her to celebrate.\n\n\"That was massive moment for her. Like, that's a big, big breakthrough,\" a magnanimous Hull said.\n\n\"I was lucky to have that big breakthrough last year, so I know how special those moments are.\n\n\"And just to watch her realise what she had done, it was really special celebrate \u2026 she deserves it.\"\n\nJess Hull had to stretch to split the Kenyans Dorcus Ewoi and Nelly Chepchirchir. (AP Photo: Petr David Josek)\n\nThe humility that Hull showed speaks volumes of her character \u2014 something Hull credits her parents with instilling in her.\n\nBut for her, the feeling was more relief, the pressure of entering a major global meet as an Olympic silver medallist and among the favourites to claim a medal was clearly playing on her mind.\n\n\"That bronze is something I'm really, really proud of it,\" she said.\n\n\"It's definitely been different this year, to see myself as a medallist and to just embrace this position, and to come back and to get on the podium again, it's been really hard and it's been a lot of steps forward that I've had to make.\"\n\nJessica Hull sandwiched the Kenyan athletes.

I think the team can see how much I love what I do and how seriously I take it.\n\n\"I do really want to be one of the best in the world and I think just leading by experience and leading by example is something that I really pride myself on.\"\n\nStanding in her way of being the best in the world is Kipyegon, the evergreen \"Smiling Destroyer\" who added yet another major global title to her packed trophy cabinet.\n\nFour world 1,500m titles, and counting? (Getty Images: Hannah Peters)\n\n\"It was pretty incredible to watch her run away \u2026 very impressive,\" Hull said.\n\n\"The legacy she's leaving is huge.\n\n\"And you know, I hope that this means she comes back in 2027, because why would you leave an event that is still so dominant in?\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

        "text": "Animal advocates have called on the Western Australia government to follow the lead of other jurisdictions and phase out greyhound racing, as a state parliamentary inquiry examines the sport.\n\nAustralia has about 60 greyhound racing tracks operating nationwide, and has been touted as the world's largest commercial greyhound racing industry.\n\nBut with Tasmania's recent announcement that the sport would be phased out in that state by 2029, and the closure of the historic Dapto track in New South Wales, the tide may be turning.\n\nMel Harrison, president of advocacy group Free The Hounds, said both WA and the country had fallen behind.\n\n\"Wales is phasing it out, Scotland's phasing it out, Tasmania, New Zealand \u2014 let's get on board, Australia,\" she told ABC Radio Perth.\n\nThe Dapto track had been operating for almost 90 years. (ABC News: Billy Cooper)\n\nA petition with more than 26,000 signatures calling for the industry to be phased out was tabled in WA's parliament, prompting the inquiry.\n\nThere were 23 greyhound deaths on tracks in the state last year, second only to Victoria, which recorded 46 deaths, according to data recorded by the Coalition for the Protection of Greyhounds.\n\nThere have been 10 deaths on tracks in WA so far in 2025.\n\nMs Harrison said it was high time for the industry to be scrutinised.\n\n\"The greyhounds finally get to have their stories heard, because they can't speak for themselves,\" she said.\n\n\"There are so many ancillary things that go on with racing \u2014 you've got gambling, and all sorts of rehoming issues.\n\nDogs cross line for last time at famed track after 90 years of racing Photo shows Crowd in stand, dogs blurry The Dapto Dogs has held its final race meet after almost 90 years of greyhound racing.\n\n\"[The greyhounds] fall into the community rescue groups and these are all funded through the community \u2026 that has cost, in the past, Greyhound Adoptions WA up to $250,000 a year in vet bills.\"\n\nThe inquiry will be the first wide-ranging probe of its kind into the industry in WA.\n\nThe WA Greyhound Racing Association (WAGRA), the state's industry body, operates three tracks in Cannington, Mandurah and Northam.\n\nThe parliamentary committee will focus on industry practices and data around animal welfare, governance arrangements, and post-racing care of greyhounds.\n\nCommunity concerns\n\nCommittee chair Sandra Carr said the amount of community concern warranted a review of the industry.\n\n\"The many thousands of signatories to this petition demonstrate ongoing community concern about animal welfare and the greyhound racing industry,\" she said.\n\nSandra Carr is leading the committee. (ABC Midwest Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nOpposition racing and wagering spokesperson Lachlan Hunter said he had seen the greyhound industry doing \"the right thing\" in his time in the job.\n\n\"I've always been a big supporter of ensuring that industries are transparent, industries are sustainable, and they meet community expectations,\" he said.\n\n\" Over the past six months in opposition, I've seen nothing but the industry do the right thing \u2026 as the shadow minister, I support the greyhound racing industry. \"\n\nMr Hunter said the industry had a track record of keeping greyhounds safe during races, and contributed to the state's economy.\n\n\"This is a government that is clearly trying to appease the Greens and the Animal Justice Party in the upper house,\" he said.\n\nThe Tasmanian government says it will phase out the greyhound industry by 2029. (AAP: David Moir)\n\nOne Nation MP Philip Scott also defended the industry while addressing the Legislative Council on Tuesday night, citing a recent visit to Cannington where he said the dogs looked \"very happy\".\n\n\"Greyhound racing has been under scrutiny for years. The industry knows this and is doing everything in its power to make sure it survives,\" he said.\n\n\"Obviously, the welfare of the dogs is front and centre in the minds of everyone. That includes the owners, the trainers and the public.\"\n\nGovernment backing\n\nBoth WAGRA and Racing and Wagering WA (RWWA) \u2014 the industry and regulating bodies respectively \u2014 are government entities.\n\nWAGRA referred the ABC's enquiry to RWWA, which declined to comment.\n\nMs Harrison said the relationship between the two organisations and the government was problematic.\n\n\"You've got these three entities sort of looking at each other, and that's part of the problem,\" she said.\n\n\"How can somebody be overseeing welfare, gaming and integrity, and also the commercial side of it?\"\n\nIn a statement, Racing and Gaming Minister Paul Papalia said he did not want to pre-empt the inquiry.\n\nPaul Papalia is WA's racing and gaming minister. (ABC Mid West: Piper Duffy)\n\n\"Parliamentary Committees are independent of government and free to undertake inquiries in accordance with their relevant chamber's Standing Orders,\" he said.\n\nMr Hunter called on the minister for more clarity.\n\n\"The government needs to come out and be very, very clear to the industry, to the people of Western Australia, whether the minister supports the future of the greyhound industry,\" he said.\n\nThe inquiry is open to public submissions until November 17.\n\nLoading...",

Every game ... except the grand final.\n\nOnly Channel Seven can broadcast the grand final live. Credit: Stephen Kiprillis/AFL Photos\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped Fox asking the question. Let me explain.\n\nSeven have exclusive rights to the grand final. Once the game is over, as per the contract, Fox is allowed to show a replay on Fox Footy and Kayo. The replay can include their own commentators.\n\nSo Fox politely asked the AFL if they could use a commentary box at the MCG, for their team to call the game from the ground as if live, but air the match later.\n\nUh oh. The contract stipulates in black and white that during the grand final, no one from Fox is allowed inside the MCG.\n\nSeven \u2013 via the AFL \u2013 has reminded Fox it is absolutely allowed to call the game from its studio in South Melbourne. I mean, it\u2019s not as if Fox hasn\u2019t done that before this year. Just ask Brian Taylor, who has taken every opportunity to call out the opposition when they have commentated games remotely.\n\nWhen approached for comment, Seven assured Scoop in September there was no finals fracas, because there is nothing to fight about. The contract is the contract.\n\nFox Footy commentators Garry Lyon, Anthony Hudson and Nathan Buckley would have to call the grand final from their studio in South Melbourne. Credit: AFL Photos, Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe look forward to bringing every moment of the 2025 grand final to all Australians from 7am AEST through to the post match celebrations live, free and exclusively on Seven,\u201d the network\u2019s football boss Gary O\u2019Keefe said.\n\nThe AFL, which wouldn\u2019t respond publicly, told this column that only a gesture of goodwill from Seven would grant Fox entry to the \u2019G.\n\nSeven has sent a pretty clear message. Like Gretchen Wieners in the comedy blockbuster Mean Girls: \u201cYou can\u2019t sit with us!\u201d But we don\u2019t think Seven is being mean.\n\nUnless the host broadcaster has a change of heart (highly unlikely) or the AFL changes its position, you won\u2019t see any of Fox\u2019s commentary team at the MCG on September 27.\n\nYou\u2019ll see Seven\u2019s James Brayshaw calling alongside \u201cBT\u201d, with special comments from Kane Cornes and Luke Hodge.\n\nAt least Fox\u2019s marquee caller Gerard Whateley will be there if, as expected, he\u2019s calling for SEN. But fellow Fox commentators such as Anthony Hudson, Dwayne Russell and whomever Fox chooses as its special comments pundits \u2013 Garry Lyon, Nathan Buckley, Jason Dunstall, Jonathan Brown and Jordan Lewis \u2013 are likely to be locked in a studio down the road.",

        "text": "Small dogs and cats will be permitted to travel underneath the seat in front, secured in a carrier. Credit: iStock What is the pilot\u2019s role? As Virgin moves ahead with its plans, the process by which pilots will judge the safety of dogs and cats remains unclear. Under Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) rules, a pilot in command must take reasonable steps to ensure the carriage of an animal does not adversely affect the safety of the flight. \u201cA person may only bring an animal onto an aircraft with your [the pilot\u2019s] permission. Before you give permission, all reasonable steps must be taken to ensure carrying the animal will not adversely affect aviation safety,\u201d CASA general operations and flight rules say. What constitutes a \u201creasonable step\u201d may vary depending on the airline, aircraft type and the animal being carried. Virgin already transports dogs and cats in its planes\u2019 cargo holds, as well as \u201cnon-exotic\u201d birds, rabbits, guinea pigs, mice, rats, snakes and lizards.\n\nA common sight overseas. In New Jersey, an airline passenger checks in his pet labradoodle. Credit: iStock How much will travelling with a pet in a cabin add to your airfare? Virgin says it will cost $149 per pet per flight. That\u2019s comparable to prices in the US. United, for example, charges $US150 ($230) for a pet in the cabin, each way. What is spent on pet travel may be saved on lodging a dog or cat while away, Jopp said. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to find a dog sitter, and you might feel that owner\u2019s guilt if you have to leave a dog in a kennel when you are going on a holiday. So the ability to take a pet with you on the holiday might be something that a lot of people are looking for.\u201d What about people who don\u2019t like pets?\n\n\u201cNot everyone is an animal person,\u201d said Jopp. \u201cThey might be allergic to cats, perhaps. You never know how your pet is going to react the first time they go on a flight, especially during the take-off and landing. Maybe they\u2019ll become nervous; maybe they\u2019ll start barking or howling.\u201d Credit: Getty Images They could become nauseous. There is the possibility of backlash from people who oppose pets in planes, Jopp said. Nevertheless, a poll of pet owners commissioned by Virgin showed nearly 70 per cent of respondents said they would travel with their pet in the cabin if given the option. RSPCA Australia said it welcomed the announcement by Virgin. Nearly 70 per cent of the nation\u2019s households own pets. What about people with allergies to pets?\n\nVirgin Australia said its aircraft were equipped with advanced HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filtration systems, which refresh cabin air 20 to 30 times an hour with sterile air, \u201cflowing from ceiling to floor\u201d. As a result, most passengers can be \u201ccomfortably\u201d seated just a few rows away from pets without experiencing allergic reactions. Allergic passengers can request to be moved within the same cabin class free of charge, Virgin said, which was a solution anticipated by Food Safety Australia New Zealand in its August report. Submissions from individuals to FSANZ focused on concerns about health impacts for people with allergies to animals, but \u201cnon-food allergens\u201d were beyond the scope of the application made to the regulator. \u201cSubmissions from individuals were almost evenly divided between support and non-support\u201d for pets in cabins, it said.\n\nLoading For those with pet allergies on planes, the US-based Asthma & Allergy Network, which opposes pets on planes, has laid out a plan of action: \u201cRequest to sit as far away as possible from pets when making a reservation, wear a mask or nasal filters to block pet allergens, pre-medicate with an antihistamine or nasal spray, and carry a quick-relief [Ventolin] inhaler if you have asthma.\u201d What about the pets themselves? Dr Sam Kovac, founder of Sydney-based Southern Cross Vet said dogs and cats, like humans, also have Eustachian tubes that connect their ears, nose and throat. A pressure change can sometimes cause a sensation of build-up and even ringing for the animals. \u201cDogs and cats can\u2019t tell us if they\u2019re experiencing discomfort, and we can\u2019t give them a lolly to suck on, or tell them to yawn.\u201d However, special dog earmuffs exist to help with the pressure changes, he said.\n\nBringing a chew toy on board with your pet \u201ccan help to equalise the pressure for a more enjoyable flight,\u201d Kovac said. Travelling animals can also get motion sickness. \u201cTurbulence, the unfamiliar environment and take-off and landing can cause dogs to whimper,\u201d said Kovac. \u201cHowever, as they\u2019re with their best friend [you], gentle affection and cuddling likely minimises this.\u201d RSPCA Australia said: \u201cGuardians should ensure that their pet is under control, socialised to other animals and people, and calm and comfortable when travelling.\u201d To avoid animals relieving themselves in-flight, Virgin has worked with a veterinarian to develop guidelines for exercise, feeding, hydration, and toileting before the flight. \u201cTo manage any unexpected incidents, pet carriers must have a leak-proof base, and absorbent mats must be placed both inside and beneath the carrier,\u201d Virgin said. When is this set to begin?\n\nFrom Wednesday, passengers can book a place for their animals on flights between Melbourne and the Gold Coast and Melbourne and the Sunshine Coast, at the introductory price of $149 per animal, per one-way trip. After January 30, the service will be available across all Virgin\u2019s domestic flights. Passengers will need to arrive at the airport with their pet in an approved carrier with cable ties that secure all but one opening and an absorbent mat placed inside. The pet will need to be fitted with a harness or collar and lead. Why this change? For many people, pets are more important than they used to be, so allowing them on planes appears to follow this trend. The Victorian government commissioned a first-ever statewide pet census in the 2022-23 budget, finding that a quarter of those surveyed said owning a pet gave them \u201csomeone to look after\u201d and provided a sense of family.\n\nIn May, Italy\u2019s aviation regulator decided to allow airlines to carry dogs larger than eight kilograms on planes. Italian Civil Aviation Authority president Pierluigi Di Palma described the change as a response to new societal needs. Jopp said declining birth rates had perhaps caused a rethink about the roles of pets. \u201cMaybe that is a sign people are replacing children with pets, and maybe that\u2019s part of the higher status that is now given to your pet cat or dog, because it really becomes a part of the family.\u201d Indeed, public figures as varied as Elon Musk, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and the late Pope Francis have sounded the alarm on declining birthrates. Francis called out people who did not want children for reasons of \u201cselfishness\u201d. A man with a falcon shops at Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar. Credit: Getty Images\n\n\u201cSometimes they have one, and that\u2019s it, but they have dogs and cats that take the place of children,\u201d he said. Jopp said: \u201cI think that the dog has gone from being out in the yard and in the kennel to in the house to on the bed in many cases.

        "text": "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will leave Papua New Guinea (PNG) without finalising a high-level defence pact between the two nations after PNG's cabinet couldn't sign off on the landmark agreement in time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe defence treaty, known as the Pukpuk Treaty and named after the pidgin word for crocodile, between Australia and Papua New Guinea was not signed as planned on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe treaty would elevate the countries' relationship to an alliance, allow PNG nationals to serve in Australia's defence force, and would impose mutual support obligations if either country comes under attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nPNG Prime Minister James Marape announced that a communique laying out the wording of the pact was signed in lieu and asserted to reporters that Australia and PNG are \"security partners\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMarape said he is still in the process of delivering the treaty to his cabinet and thanked Albanese for being in Port Moresby.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese referred to Australia and PNG as the \"truest of friends\" and congratulated the country on the anniversary of its independence.\n\n\n\nMarape was optimistic the treaty, which was initiated by PNG, would be signed in coming weeks and said it would take the relationship between the two countries to a \"new level\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will go through our respective cabinet processes and expect to finalise the signing of the treaty,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia and PNG will keep walking together, side by side, step by step.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked if the failure to sign the treaty on Wednesday was \"embarrassing\" by a reporter, Albanese said he respects the processes of the PNG cabinet and they've had a \"busy week\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMarape said increasing PNG's defence capacity was crucial to him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I go to sleep every night worried if someone invades my country, what is my defence for my country?\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese told reporters on Tuesday that the PNG cabinet met on Monday night to give final approval but didn't have a quorum (the minimum of people to make the meeting valid) because some ministers were back in their constituencies for independence celebrations.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Albanese says Australia-PNG defence treaty on par with US and New Zealand\n\nBut he expected his counterpart James Marape to sort it out quickly by ushering the process through his cabinet virtually.\n\n\n\n\n\nCelebrations to mark PNG's independence from Australia wrapped up on Tuesday night with a mass gathering at Port Moresby's Sir John Guise Stadium.\n\n\n\nSupport for the Pukpuk Treaty\n\nIn Canberra, the pact was backed by Opposition leader Sussan Ley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The new treaty being finalised by Papua New Guinea and Australia will bring a transformation of our mutual partnership \u2014 providing the basis of deeper ties for the next 50 years,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese said the idea that PNG would be attacked and Australia would sit back and watch is \"something that wouldn't happen\" given their history and close ties.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarape has said he had \"a moral obligation to build my military to a level that I can have the capacity to defend Papua New Guinea, every child\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe landmark agreement would also enable PNG nationals to serve in Australia's defence force with the same pay as other members and start a pathway to citizenship.\n\n\n\n\n\nPNG defence minister Billy Joseph said on Monday the deal was a \"mutual defence treaty\" that would have the nations working together to defend each other's territories.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Papua New Guinea celebrates 50th anniversary of independence from Australia SBS News 06:37 English\n\nIt is likely the deal will be seen with a more cynical eye across the Pacific, with many nations not well disposed to the militarisation of the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese's deal-making in the Pacific has been a central tenet of his government's foreign policy, including a landmark climate pact with Tuvalu and a migrant-dumping agreement with Nauru.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is also pursuing a security treaty with Fiji, one of just three Pacific nations to have a defence force, along with PNG and Tonga.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent years, Australia has struggled to carve out security pacts with two other Melanesian nations \u2014 the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu \u2014 which maintain warmer ties with China.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens have also raised concerns over the Pukpuk Treaty, including the degree of integration between the two forces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What, for example, would Australia's role be if there is a return to conflict in [the autonomous island region of] Bougainville?\" defence spokesperson David Shoebridge asked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Does it mean they follow us into a US war, or is it about military bases?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Absorbing PNG's military into the Australian Defence Force is a very questionable way to celebrate the 50th anniversary of independence.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a gift to mark its golden jubilee, Australia will help PNG build a new ministerial wing at its parliament.\n\n\n\n",

We need to be prepared for that as well,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But in most cases, these companies want to operate in Australia and they respect Australian law.\"\n\n\n\neSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said the guidance encourages platforms to work collaboratively with eSafety to ensure compliance. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas\n\nWhich platforms are included?\n\nThe government has previously said that age-restricted social media platforms will include Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube, among other platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the legislation was passed by parliament last November, YouTube was one of a handful of platforms listed as exempt because they were \"out of scope\" of the policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Inman Grant later wrote to Wells, making a formal recommendation that YouTube be included among the banned platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline gaming, messaging apps, health and education services won't be included.\n\n\n\nA 'monumental event' for children\n\nInman Grant acknowledged the upcoming ban will be a \"monumental event\" for a lot of children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of children welcome this, as certainly parents do.

Here's the full schedule for SBS' broadcast of the World Athletics Championships.\n\n\n\nWho is Gout Gout up against?\n\nGout Gout will have some strong competition this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe favourite is Noah Lyles from the United States, and for good reason: he's won all three of the last world championship titles in the event.\n\n\n\n\n\nLyles is one of 13 entrants in the men's 200m who have achieved a time of under 20 seconds sometime this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nGout, who holds the Oceanian record for the 200m , is sitting just outside of that barrier at 20.02 seconds.\n\n\n\nGout Gout won the men's 200m at the Ostrava Golden Spike athletics meet in the Czech Republic earlier this year, becoming the new Oceanian record holder with a time of 20.02 seconds. Source: AAP / AP / Petr David Josek US athletes Kenneth Bednarek and T'Mars McCallum, Jamaica's Bryan Levell and Botswana's Letsile Tebogo will also be ones to watch.\n\n\n\nWhat would Gout Gout making the final mean?\n\nGout Gout qualifying for the 200m final would be an immense achievement: only three Australian men have achieved such a feat, and none have done so since 2005.\n\n\n\nAs the youngest athlete to ever compete in the 200m at the championships, he'd also be the youngest finalist in the event's history. That distinction is currently held by Japan's Abdul Hakim Sani Brown, who claimed it in 2017 at the age of 18 years and 157 days.\n\n\n\nWhat has Gout Gout said?\n\nDuring a pre-race media event on Monday, Gout Gout shared how he was feeling ahead of the heats.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said a new personal best, regardless of where he ended up in the rankings, would he a huge success in his eyes.\n\n\n\n\"It's about mentally telling myself that I deserve to be here, that I'm the same as everyone else,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obviously, my first experience at this level so I'm trying not to put too much pressure on myself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But also putting on enough pressure so I can go out there and run very fast and have fun with it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery session from the nine-day event will be broadcast live and free across SBS VICELAND, including the World Athletics Championships 2025 Hub via SBS On Demand, which will also feature full replays, mini recaps and Aussie Focus clips for every session.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning sessions will run from 8am to 1.30pm AEST on September 13\u201315 and 20\u201321, while evening sessions will be from 8pm to 11.30pm AEST each night of the championships.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's the full schedule for SBS's broadcast of the World Athletics Championships.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

Every game ... except the grand final.\n\nOnly Channel Seven can broadcast the grand final live. Credit: Stephen Kiprillis/AFL Photos\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t stopped Fox asking the question. Let me explain.\n\nSeven have exclusive rights to the grand final. Once the game is over, as per the contract, Fox is allowed to show a replay on Fox Footy and Kayo. The replay can include their own commentators.\n\nSo Fox politely asked the AFL if they could use a commentary box at the MCG, for their team to call the game from the ground as if live, but air the match later.\n\nUh oh. The contract stipulates in black and white that during the grand final, no one from Fox is allowed inside the MCG.\n\nSeven \u2013 via the AFL \u2013 has reminded Fox it is absolutely allowed to call the game from its studio in South Melbourne. I mean, it\u2019s not as if Fox hasn\u2019t done that before this year. Just ask Brian Taylor, who has taken every opportunity to call out the opposition when they have commentated games remotely.\n\nWhen approached for comment, Seven assured Scoop in September there was no finals fracas, because there is nothing to fight about. The contract is the contract.\n\nFox Footy commentators Garry Lyon, Anthony Hudson and Nathan Buckley would have to call the grand final from their studio in South Melbourne. Credit: AFL Photos, Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe look forward to bringing every moment of the 2025 grand final to all Australians from 7am AEST through to the post match celebrations live, free and exclusively on Seven,\u201d the network\u2019s football boss Gary O\u2019Keefe said.\n\nThe AFL, which wouldn\u2019t respond publicly, told this column that only a gesture of goodwill from Seven would grant Fox entry to the \u2019G.\n\nSeven has sent a pretty clear message. Like Gretchen Wieners in the comedy blockbuster Mean Girls: \u201cYou can\u2019t sit with us!\u201d But we don\u2019t think Seven is being mean.\n\nUnless the host broadcaster has a change of heart (highly unlikely) or the AFL changes its position, you won\u2019t see any of Fox\u2019s commentary team at the MCG on September 27.\n\nYou\u2019ll see Seven\u2019s James Brayshaw calling alongside \u201cBT\u201d, with special comments from Kane Cornes and Luke Hodge.\n\nAt least Fox\u2019s marquee caller Gerard Whateley will be there if, as expected, he\u2019s calling for SEN. But fellow Fox commentators such as Anthony Hudson, Dwayne Russell and whomever Fox chooses as its special comments pundits \u2013 Garry Lyon, Nathan Buckley, Jason Dunstall, Jonathan Brown and Jordan Lewis \u2013 are likely to be locked in a studio down the road.",

        "text": "Small dogs and cats will be permitted to travel underneath the seat in front, secured in a carrier. Credit: iStock What is the pilot\u2019s role? As Virgin moves ahead with its plans, the process by which pilots will judge the safety of dogs and cats remains unclear. Under Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) rules, a pilot in command must take reasonable steps to ensure the carriage of an animal does not adversely affect the safety of the flight. \u201cA person may only bring an animal onto an aircraft with your [the pilot\u2019s] permission. Before you give permission, all reasonable steps must be taken to ensure carrying the animal will not adversely affect aviation safety,\u201d CASA general operations and flight rules say. What constitutes a \u201creasonable step\u201d may vary depending on the airline, aircraft type and the animal being carried. Virgin already transports dogs and cats in its planes\u2019 cargo holds, as well as \u201cnon-exotic\u201d birds, rabbits, guinea pigs, mice, rats, snakes and lizards.\n\nA common sight overseas. In New Jersey, an airline passenger checks in his pet labradoodle. Credit: iStock How much will travelling with a pet in a cabin add to your airfare? Virgin says it will cost $149 per pet per flight. That\u2019s comparable to prices in the US. United, for example, charges $US150 ($230) for a pet in the cabin, each way. What is spent on pet travel may be saved on lodging a dog or cat while away, Jopp said. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to find a dog sitter, and you might feel that owner\u2019s guilt if you have to leave a dog in a kennel when you are going on a holiday. So the ability to take a pet with you on the holiday might be something that a lot of people are looking for.\u201d What about people who don\u2019t like pets?\n\n\u201cNot everyone is an animal person,\u201d said Jopp. \u201cThey might be allergic to cats, perhaps. You never know how your pet is going to react the first time they go on a flight, especially during the take-off and landing. Maybe they\u2019ll become nervous; maybe they\u2019ll start barking or howling.\u201d Credit: Getty Images They could become nauseous. There is the possibility of backlash from people who oppose pets in planes, Jopp said. Nevertheless, a poll of pet owners commissioned by Virgin showed nearly 70 per cent of respondents said they would travel with their pet in the cabin if given the option. RSPCA Australia said it welcomed the announcement by Virgin. Nearly 70 per cent of the nation\u2019s households own pets. What about people with allergies to pets?\n\nVirgin Australia said its aircraft were equipped with advanced HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filtration systems, which refresh cabin air 20 to 30 times an hour with sterile air, \u201cflowing from ceiling to floor\u201d. As a result, most passengers can be \u201ccomfortably\u201d seated just a few rows away from pets without experiencing allergic reactions. Allergic passengers can request to be moved within the same cabin class free of charge, Virgin said, which was a solution anticipated by Food Safety Australia New Zealand in its August report. Submissions from individuals to FSANZ focused on concerns about health impacts for people with allergies to animals, but \u201cnon-food allergens\u201d were beyond the scope of the application made to the regulator. \u201cSubmissions from individuals were almost evenly divided between support and non-support\u201d for pets in cabins, it said.\n\nLoading For those with pet allergies on planes, the US-based Asthma & Allergy Network, which opposes pets on planes, has laid out a plan of action: \u201cRequest to sit as far away as possible from pets when making a reservation, wear a mask or nasal filters to block pet allergens, pre-medicate with an antihistamine or nasal spray, and carry a quick-relief [Ventolin] inhaler if you have asthma.\u201d What about the pets themselves? Dr Sam Kovac, founder of Sydney-based Southern Cross Vet said dogs and cats, like humans, also have Eustachian tubes that connect their ears, nose and throat. A pressure change can sometimes cause a sensation of build-up and even ringing for the animals. \u201cDogs and cats can\u2019t tell us if they\u2019re experiencing discomfort, and we can\u2019t give them a lolly to suck on, or tell them to yawn.\u201d However, special dog earmuffs exist to help with the pressure changes, he said.\n\nBringing a chew toy on board with your pet \u201ccan help to equalise the pressure for a more enjoyable flight,\u201d Kovac said. Travelling animals can also get motion sickness. \u201cTurbulence, the unfamiliar environment and take-off and landing can cause dogs to whimper,\u201d said Kovac. \u201cHowever, as they\u2019re with their best friend [you], gentle affection and cuddling likely minimises this.\u201d RSPCA Australia said: \u201cGuardians should ensure that their pet is under control, socialised to other animals and people, and calm and comfortable when travelling.\u201d To avoid animals relieving themselves in-flight, Virgin has worked with a veterinarian to develop guidelines for exercise, feeding, hydration, and toileting before the flight. \u201cTo manage any unexpected incidents, pet carriers must have a leak-proof base, and absorbent mats must be placed both inside and beneath the carrier,\u201d Virgin said. When is this set to begin?\n\nFrom Wednesday, passengers can book a place for their animals on flights between Melbourne and the Gold Coast and Melbourne and the Sunshine Coast, at the introductory price of $149 per animal, per one-way trip. After January 30, the service will be available across all Virgin\u2019s domestic flights. Passengers will need to arrive at the airport with their pet in an approved carrier with cable ties that secure all but one opening and an absorbent mat placed inside. The pet will need to be fitted with a harness or collar and lead. Why this change? For many people, pets are more important than they used to be, so allowing them on planes appears to follow this trend. The Victorian government commissioned a first-ever statewide pet census in the 2022-23 budget, finding that a quarter of those surveyed said owning a pet gave them \u201csomeone to look after\u201d and provided a sense of family.\n\nIn May, Italy\u2019s aviation regulator decided to allow airlines to carry dogs larger than eight kilograms on planes. Italian Civil Aviation Authority president Pierluigi Di Palma described the change as a response to new societal needs. Jopp said declining birth rates had perhaps caused a rethink about the roles of pets. \u201cMaybe that is a sign people are replacing children with pets, and maybe that\u2019s part of the higher status that is now given to your pet cat or dog, because it really becomes a part of the family.\u201d Indeed, public figures as varied as Elon Musk, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and the late Pope Francis have sounded the alarm on declining birthrates. Francis called out people who did not want children for reasons of \u201cselfishness\u201d. A man with a falcon shops at Hamad International Airport in Doha, Qatar. Credit: Getty Images\n\n\u201cSometimes they have one, and that\u2019s it, but they have dogs and cats that take the place of children,\u201d he said. Jopp said: \u201cI think that the dog has gone from being out in the yard and in the kennel to in the house to on the bed in many cases. So I think the position of the pet in the family has changed over the past couple of decades.\u201d He said some of the views around animals differed between cultures. In the Middle East, there isn\u2019t a special allowance for dogs or cats \u2013 but falcons are \u201cseen with great respect and cultural significance\u201d, particularly by the region\u2019s wealthy, he said. For example, Emirates\u2019 website says: \u201cPets are not permitted in the cabin, with the exception of falcons between Dubai and certain destinations in Pakistan.\u201d",

        "text": "The Pacific Islands Forum wrapped up its annual leaders meeting last week with some significant agreements, including the launch of the region\u2019s own climate financing facility, the endorsement of the Ocean of Peace declaration and policies on partnerships and broader aspirations for \u201cdeeper integration\u201d.\n\nBut integration remains a contested term. It implies unity but is shaped by the often uneven and unequal ways in which the region is tied together.\n\nAn EU-style integration has never taken root in the Pacific, primarily because forum members are not equals. Some are newly independent, while others, such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia, remain colonised.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAustralia and New Zealand sit apart as larger, wealthier powers whose influence inevitably shapes the terms of integration. A closer look into the recent forum\u2019s resolutions illustrates this fragile balance.\n\nIntegrating peace, bilaterally\n\nLike many negotiated texts, the Ocean of Peace declaration is filled with ambiguities that allow for diverging interpretations and opportunities for it to be co-opted.\n\nFor larger forum powers, peace cannot be separated from deterrence. Since the China-Solomon Islands pact in 2022 bilateral security deals have proliferated, now including reports of a landmark PNG-Australia defence treaty promising \u201ctotal integration\u201d.\n\nSecurity is therefore integrating bilaterally, with only thin reinforcement at the regional level.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nFor many Pacific nations, peace looks different. It means little without confronting climate change, nuclear harms and human security. For them, integration takes shape through initiatives such as the Pacific Resilience Facility, a regional fund designed to unlock access to climate finance, or through joint efforts on labour mobility and human development.\n\nThe Ocean of Peace declaration is light on ambition. It avoids any reference to demilitarisation, even as the Pacific sees unprecedented military build-up.\n\nOn nuclear issues, the declaration focuses narrowly on testing and legacy, while sidestepping contemporary controversies, including Japan\u2019s treated-nuclear water discharges or nuclear propulsion and stationing under AUKUS. That omission is deliberate \u2013 consensus was preserved, but only by avoiding the hardest questions.\n\nColonial legacies\n\nThis dynamic is also evident in the Review of the Regional Architecture (RRA), designed to respond to increasing interest in the region. The RRA is policy-speak for how the region should better \u201cwork together\u201d under diverging pressures.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt goes to the heart of Pacific regionalism, raising difficult questions about who sits at the table, how power is shared, and how much sovereignty members are willing to cede in the pursuit of deeper integration.\n\nBut these questions expose a harder truth about the region\u2019s dependence on Australia and New Zealand in particular, and the colonial roots of its institutions.\n\nColonial powers sit as members of all major regional bodies and dominate the security architecture. Foreign policy jargon such as the \u201ccentrality of the Forum\u201d and \u201cfamily-first approach\u201d are less about unity than limiting entry of non-traditional partners.\n\nA high-level political panel consulted and presented its findings to forum leaders. But Nauru\u2019s rejection of the RRA in its entirety underscores the sensitivities, and comes despite former Nauruan President Baron Waqa now serving as secretary general.\n\nTaiwan and China\n\nIn response to the surge in external interest, leaders endorsed a tiered partnerships policy. The real test will be in how it is applied and who falls to the lower tier. One partner, Taiwan, is used to this dynamic.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe leaders\u2019 reaffirmation of their 1992 decision on \u201cdevelopment partners\u201d (code for Taiwan) keeps it in a separate track altogether: invited to the forum but not part of the main partners\u2019 dialogue.\n\nBut Taiwan\u2019s role is hard to ignore. In seeking to better integrate climate finance flows, its US$3 million pledge to the Pacific Resilience Facility sits alongside China\u2019s US$500,000. Taiwan is excluded politically, yet contributes more than China.\n\nAnother irony is that while much of the debate focused on how to deepen integration, West Papua and New Caledonia face the opposite. To the Indigenous population, regionalism is not integration, but the right to dis-integrate.\n\nIt was also stressed last week that there cannot be genuine regionalism without addressing unfinished decolonisation. Pacific nations generally support self-determination but manage relations with France and Indonesia.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe forum\u2019s communique reflects this balancing act. On West Papua, it once again reaffirmed Indonesia\u2019s sovereignty, while the long-promised UN Human Rights Commissioner\u2019s mission is no closer to happening.\n\nOn New Caledonia, leaders simply \u201cnoted\u201d the High-Level Troika Plus mission report from October 2023, signalling reluctance to be drawn too deeply into France\u2019s unfinished process.\n\nA region of people-centred integration\n\nThe freer movement of Pacific people is one of the clearest examples of deepening integration. Like security, it is driven through bilateral agreements, then elevated to principle at the regional level, such as the endorsement of the Labour Mobility Principles. Australia and New Zealand schemes provide vital jobs and remittances.\n\nPacific communities are interwoven with Australia, New Zealand and the United States through geography, legacy and large diasporas, and with France through its territories. But this form of integration carries economic and social impacts and actively shapes political futures.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf sovereignty is to be preserved, integration must advance Pacific agency rather than entrench dependency. If it does the latter, it edges towards neo-colonialism in disguise.\n\nIntegration can empower Pacific nations and people through shared opportunities and connections. But it can also constrain when shaped by unequal power. The joint Pacific-Australian bid to host next year\u2019s UN climate summit in Adelaide is a clear example of the imbalance: the Pacific lends its moral voice, but Australia holds the gavel.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation.

        "text": "In recent years, private equity has changed the global sports landscape, with clubs from Major League Baseball (MLB) and the National Football League (NFL), rugby union in New Zealand and European soccer reaping massive financial benefits.\n\nSports codes in Australia and New Zealand have also dipped their toes in the water, with potentially more to come: Cricket Australia is reportedly considering selling its Big Bash League teams to private investors.\n\nHowever, there may be tax implications and other risks that negatively impact these leagues, which enjoy tax exemption status as not-for-profit entities that promote or encourage sport.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPrivate equity investments raise questions over whether sporting bodies can continue to claim the tax exemption.\n\nRead more: Australia's major sports codes are considered not-for-profits \u2013 is it time for them to pay up?\n\nHow Australian sport is changing\n\nThere was a seismic change in Australian sports\u2019 ownership structure in 2021 when private equity firm Silver Lake paid A$140 million for a 33% share of the A-League.\n\nThere was also a $6.5 million bid to privatise Super Netball in 2021. The deal was rejected. Then-Netball Australia CEO Kelly Ryan said the bid was turned down because: \u201cwe don\u2019t know whether private equity is what is best for our sport just yet\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThen in 2023 Football Australia considered selling the men\u2019s and women\u2019s national teams, the Socceroos and Matildas, to private equity for 99 years. The deal did not go ahead due to privacy concerns for participants in Australian soccer and the potential for Football Australia to lose its tax exemption and not-for-profit status.\n\nIn 2023, Rugby Australia secured an $80 million line of credit from Pacific Equity Partners.\n\nIn 2024, Wollemi Capital Group acquired a majority stake in the Women\u2019s National Basketball League (WNBL).\n\nNow cricket is considering similar moves. It\u2019s been reported the governing body may raise significant revenue by selling its Big Bash League teams to private equity.\n\nLessons from New Zealand\n\nIn 2022, New Zealand Rugby, which controls the famous All Blacks team, sold a 5.71% stake for NZ$200 million (A$180m) to American private equity firm Silver Lake.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe deal valued New Zealand Rugby at NZ$3.5 billion (A$3.15 billion).\n\nWhile the New Zealand Rugby League Players\u2019 Association initially opposed the sale, it eventually voted to approve the deal.\n\nNew Zealand Rugby, the New Zealand Rugby League Players\u2019 Association and Silver Lake created an international rugby investment business called New Zealand Rugby Commercial.\n\nOf the NZ$200 million, NZ$38m (A$34m) was invested in New Zealand Rugby Commercial for revenue generation, NZ$10.5m (A$9.5m) is paid annually to Silver Lake as interest and regional rugby unions receive an annual distribution of 17%.\n\nThe players\u2019 association agreed to the deal on the condition that everyday New Zealand investors could purchase up to NZ$10m (A$9m) in the new commercial venture. It is unclear whether New Zealanders did invest.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA second scheduled investment in 2023 by Silver Lake of NZ$62.5m (A$56m) to establish a legacy fund for a small share of New Zealand Rugby\u2019s equity was blocked by the players\u2019 association. However it was eventually approved by the New Zealand Rugby board after negotiations and a vote by the unions.\n\nIn late 2023 the New Zealand Rugby board advised stakeholders it was losing money and that it will spend the NZ$200m by 2031. These losses continued and in 2025, New Zealand Rugby posted a loss of $19.5 million (A$17.5m).\n\nThe losses appear to be associated with poor management rather than investment by a private equity firm: contributing to the losses were high fixed costs and player salaries.\n\nRisks and possible rewards\n\nLike the private equity deal with New Zealand Rugby, Australian sports exploring similar deals would need approval from their boards and respective player associations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nPrivate equity represents an alternative income stream for sports that rely on gambling income such as the AFL ($30 million a year) and NRL ($50 million a year). Many clubs in these leagues also earn income from poker machines.\n\nNew Zealand Rugby demonstrates that private equity investment can be hindered by mismanagement. However, a benefit can be the funding of grassroots associations.\n\nThere is also a risk of ceding ownership control to outside organisations that are motivated by profit and a return on their investment.\n\nThese risks can be negated by establishing controlling entities that are composed of the sports governing organisation, player associations and the private equity investor.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThere is concern some smaller leagues may miss out on investment from private equity, but the WNBL\u2019s deal shows it is possible to make it work.\n\nThe tax conundrum\n\nAustralian sports leagues and clubs such as the AFL, NRL and Cricket Australia enjoy an income tax exemption as not-for-profit entities that promote or encourage sport.\n\nHowever, private equity investment raises questions over whether leagues can continue to claim this tax exemption.\n\nIn order to be a not-for-profit, common law requires an entity to not pay profits to its shareholders or owners.\n\nThis principle is known as the non-distribution constraint.\n\nAs profit-orientated investors who expect a return on their investment, private equity owners in sports would appear to violate the non-distribution constraint if they receive the profits of the leagues they invest in.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSports exploring private equity must balance the income stream generated from private equity with the potential loss of tax exempt and not-for-profit status.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation.
