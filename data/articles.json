(Getty)\n\n\"Voluntary uptake has failed,\" Dr Alexandra Jones, the head of Food Governance at The George Institute for Global Health said.\n\nShe said because the system was voluntary, it was applied \"selectively... often for marketing purposes\ufeff\".\n\n\"Fundamentally people understand the concept of stars and they can use it to make a better choice,\" she said.\n\n\"In the real world their ability to actually use it has been mostly limited \ufeffby the fact that it's only on a third of products.\"\n\n\ufeffIn 2019, a review of the system found consumers understood the system\ufeff but it was not on enough labels to adequately compare similar products.\n\nThe Australian, New Zealand and state and territory governments then set the industry a series of targets in an effort to lift the uptake.\n\nThe final target, 70 per cent by November 2025, almost certainly will not be met.\ufeff\n\n\"Until it's mandatory, people will continue to struggle out there \ufeffto understand how to make good choices,\" Dietitians Australia CEO Magriet Raxworthy said.\n\n\"Australians want easy, transparent nutrition information about the food they are choosing for themselves and their families, and mandating the system will bring more consistency and clarity across the shelves.\"\n\nJones said Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) had been ordered to start the preparatory work for a mandatory system but she feared the timeline could blow out as far as 2029.\n\nExperts say the logo is applied selectively as a marketing tool, rather than health advice for consumers.

And for tens of thousands of football fans in Australia that means nine months of late nights and early starts following their favourite clubs.\n\nThis year the Premier League is set to be bigger than ever. For champions Liverpool , another title would put them one ahead than bitter rivals Manchester United .\n\nFor United, surely the season can't be any worse than last year - a title challenge is unlikely but stranger things have happened, after all, this season will mark ten years since Leicester City stunned the world by winning the championship.\n\nAnd what about Arsenal ? Is this finally their year. Spurs too have a huge fanbase in Australia, despite the decision to sack Ange Postecoglou.\n\nBut we understand not everyone is a diehard fan, so we've put together a quick guide to everything you need to know ahead of the new season.\ufeff\n\nLiverpool star Mohamed Salah will hope to lead the Reds to victory again. (AP)\n\nHow does the Premier League work?\n\nThe Premier League is made up of 20 football teams in England.\n\nEach season, three teams from the division below - called the Championship - are promoted and replace the three teams that finished in the bottom three places in the previous Premier League season.\n\nThe competition takes place in a round-robin format, where each team plays each other home and away in a 38-game season.\n\nThe team with the most points at the end of the season are crowned champions.\n\nWhich teams have been promoted to the Premier League in 2025-26 season?\n\nA couple of big teams are making their return to the Premier League this season.\n\nLeeds United are back after two seasons away; they are one of the best-supported clubs in England and have plenty of Aussie fans thanks to the exploits of Aussie stars Mark Viduka and Harry Kewell in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nSunderland are also back in the Premier League for the first time since 2017; they became known around the world thanks to their Netflix documentary 'Sunderland Till I Die', which charted their struggles after relegation from the Premier League.\n\nBurnley round off the promoted teams, who replaced Southampton, Ipswich Town and Leicester City.\n\nLeeds United are back in the top flight, and will have a big following in Australia backing them. (Getty)\n\nWhich team is likely to win the 2025-26 Premier League?\n\nThe bookmakers currently back Liverpool to retain their Premier League title after spending big in the transfer market, including spending a whopping $222 million on German star Florian Wirtz.\n\nIt is most likely to be a three-horse race for the Premier League this season, with Liverpool set to battle Arsenal and Manchester City.\n\nArsenal have finished second three seasons in a row, but have made a couple of key signings, including Viktor Gyokeres, a striker who scored 54 goals last season.\n\nManchester City have arguably the best manager in the world in Pep Guardiola and the best striker in the world in Erling Haaland, and will be out for redemption after a tough season last time out.\n\nWhat is the 'big four' in the Premier League?\n\nThe big four are the four biggest teams by support in the Premier League, and have historically been the most significant.\n\nIt refers to Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea, who became part of the special group in the 2000s as they often finished in the top four positions.\n\nThis has been challenged in recent years by Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur, with the moniker 'the big six' now used to describe the biggest sides in the league.\n\nFierce rivals Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur are part of the now 'big six' of Premier League teams. (Getty)\n\nWhat is the new 2025-26 Premier League ball?\n\nThe new Premier League season is also significant because it is the first time in 25 years Nike will not be supplying the Premier League ball.\n\nInstead, a deal with Puma has begun, with the new 'Puma Orbita' set to be used this season.\n\nThe Premier League ball has a new look and new supplier this season. (Getty)\n\nWhen does the 2025-26 Premier League begin?\n\nThe new season gets underway tomorrow morning (AEST) when champions Liverpool host Bournemouth at Anfield.\n\n\ufeffOn Saturday night, Aston Villa take on Newcastle in a game you can watch on Channel Nine at 9.30pm AEST as free-to-air Premier League football returns to Australia for the first time in six years.\n\nThe biggest game of the opening weekend sees Arsenal travel to face rivals Manchester United. That takes place on Tuesday at 2am AEST.\n\nThe season concludes on May 25, with all 10 games being played simultaneously.\n\nHow to watch the Premier League in Australia\n\nThe Premier League has a new home in Australia, with every match available live and on demand on Stan Sport . Nine, the publisher of this website, also owns Stan Sport.\n\nIn addition, one game for the first three rounds of the season will be shown on free-to-air television on Channel Nine.\n\nThese games will be Newcastle United's trip to Aston Villa on the opening weekend, Manchester City's heavyweight clash with Tottenham Hotspur, and Chelsea's local rivalry match against Fulham.\n\nThese three matches all begin at 9:30 pm (AEST).",

        "text": "How would you cope if you got lost in the bush? How long could you survive if you had to rely on your own skills? Would you drink your own wee if it was the only option?\n\nThey're questions few of us will ever answer.\n\nMost of us are too busy watching survival TV shows and scrolling wilderness content on social media, all from the safety of the suburbs.\n\nHowever, every year there are people who risk death to prove they can live off the land and endure the elements.\n\nPeople like Robert Bogucki, who danced with death during his 1999 pilgrimage into the Great Sandy Desert, and captivated strangers all over the world.\n\nDecades later, we're still hooked on watching folks more brazen than us grapple with their mortality.\n\nSurvivor, about to embark on its 49th season, is one of the longest-running reality TV shows of all time, while Alone Australia remains SBS's most successful franchise, with its latest season pulling in 3.5 million viewers.\n\nBut at a time when Australians are more buffered from risk than ever before, the pop culture obsession with outback survival is a strange phenomenon.\n\nIt hints at a craving for hardship and a desire for meaning that many feel is lacking in their lives.\n\nSurvival content is booming\n\nFor thousands of years \u2014 and to this day, in many parts of the world \u2014 humans struggled to locate enough water, food, and shelter to survive.\n\nThese days it's typically people from privileged backgrounds who test their mettle in outback survival quests \u2014 flexing their practical skills to achieve a sense of strength and psychological wellbeing by enduring discomfort and overcoming adversity.\n\nOthers opt for a safer, entry-level option \u2014 booking into the growing number of commercially run outback survival retreats.\n\nBut most people only watch survival challenges vicariously online.\n\n\"Outback Mike\" has built a large online following around content about survival. (ABC News: Holly Richardson)\n\nMike Atkinson, who's trained in outback survival in the Australian military and showcased his skills on the reality TV show Alone, has noticed interest growing in recent years.\n\n\"Most of us in our current lifestyles probably don't get out into the wilderness, but there's definitely a growing trend in recent years for people wanting to explore that kind of area,\" he says.\n\nAlone has a lesson about fear. Here's why we need it now Photo shows A group in winter clothes stands in a remote location with snowcapped mountains in the distance Fear is seen as something that should be avoided, yet should it be? The reality TV show Alone Australia shows us fear is more nuanced and positive than assumed, writes Eric Brymer.\n\nAtkinson now creates content about his wilderness adventures full time, and goes by \"Outback Mike\". He believes people are drawn to the genre because they feel disconnected from nature.\n\n\"Modern life is pretty devoid of real challenges and outback survival gives you that real challenge,\" Atkinson says.\n\n\"It's a connection to our evolutionary past, and they want to experience it.\n\n\"But I reckon less than half of people watching this material will ever actually use the skills, whether it's on camping trips or overnight hikes, or trying more challenging outdoor activities.\"\n\nWhen risky adventure divides public opinion\n\nReality TV shows create an illusion of risk, with paramedics and evacuation teams waiting on standby to snatch contestants away from danger if needed.\n\nBut a small number of people risk their lives in search of solitude and spiritual growth, drawing on an age-old belief that romanticises nature as \"authentic\", and capable of revealing fundamental human truths.\n\nThis yearning for spiritual connection is what sent Robert Bogucki out into the Great Sandy Desert in 1999.\n\nHis remarkable story of survival, as told in the ABC's Expanse: Nowhere Man podcast, inspired visceral reactions among the public.\n\nListen to the podcast Photo shows A stylised desert landscape in purple and pink with the silhoutted face of a man, titled EXPANSE NOWHERE MAN Season five of Expanse tells the extraordinary story of Robert Bogucki's survival in the Great Sandy Desert, and his return to Australia decades later.\n\nSome were envious of his chance to seek solitude and challenge away from the shackles of daily life, while others were angry about the resources that went into large-scale search efforts to find him. Many were simply baffled by an impulse to disappear alone that they couldn't understand.\n\nWhile Bogucki and his long-time partner Janet North received letters of support and celebration of his survival from around the world, there was also significant backlash.\n\nThe WA Premier at the time described Bogucki's actions as reckless, while letters to the editor scolded him as a \"'selfish ignorant rich kid\" who \"needed a good smack in the mouth\".\n\nBen Martin, a former reporter for The West Australian who joined the search for Bogucki in 1999, believes the public response is revealing.\n\n\"There's a fine line between celebrating some sort of frontier spirit, versus someone regarded as doing something a bit weird,\" he reflects.\n\n\"People judged Robert so harshly \u2026 but people are paying thousands of dollars to go to yoga retreats to disconnect and just think, which is not that different to what Robert was seeking.\n\n\"So I think the depth of thought that Robert was seeking was lost on a lot of people.\"\n\nThe saga revealed a double-standard in how we respond to people who undertake risky endeavours. An attempt to break a world record is considered brave and bold, and extreme sports like base-jumping are deadly but tolerated.\n\nBut dangerous journeys to achieve a spiritual, psychological or religious objective tend to puzzle and even offend the general public.\n\nAnother young explorer going Into the Wild\n\nThe fall-out from Bogucki's odyssey revealed a deeper tension between the desire of the state to keep people safe, and the freedom of the individual to live and die as they wish.\n\nThere are similarities with the much more famous case of Christopher McCandless, who starved to death in remote interior Alaska in 1992.\n\nMcCandless \u2014 whose story was immortalised in the 1996 book Into The Wild, and later adapted for film \u2014 was determined to prove he could live off the land, but misjudged river levels and became trapped as the freezing winter approached.\n\nThe site of the bus where McCandless spent his final days became something of a tourist spot after his death. (AP: Jillian Rogers)\n\nBoth Bogucki and McCandless were intelligent, independent-minded young American men from highly educated and well-to-do families.\n\nBoth embarked on physically and mentally challenging journeys into the wilderness, with an awareness and acceptance of the risks involved.\n\nBut only one lived to tell the tale, while the other died a preventable death in the prime of life.\n\nLooking back now, Robert Bogucki says he can understand the comparison, although their motivations differed.\n\n\"All I can say about McCandless is that he got what he wanted, to be out there alone in the wilderness,\" he says.\n\n\"And I think he had a fulfilling life. He got what he asked for.\n\n\"Some people would say 'oh, that's terrible because he died', but where do you want to die, in a hospital with a bunch of tubes sticking out of you?\"\n\nDecades after his journey into the Great Sandy Desert, Robert Bogucki met some of the people who went looking for him. (ABC News: Franque Batty)\n\nWhile Robert's quest was primarily spiritual, he endured many of the challenges and discomforts experienced by those undertaking more straight-forward survival quests.\n\nTowards the end of the trip, he was so weakened by dehydration and malnutrition that he felt he'd die if he succumbed to the feelings of despair, or stopped moving to sit under a tree for more than a few minutes.\n\nFinding Robert Bogucki Photo shows A composite image shows cut-out faces of Robert Bogucki as a young man in hospital and now, aged 59, on desert background In 1999 a young American dumped his bicycle and walked out into the Great Sandy Desert. Why was he willing to risk his life, and why do some people need to get lost in order to feel found?\n\nOn day 36 on his journey, he was so thirsty he considered drinking his own urine, but decided against it, deciding it would be akin to \"giving up\".\n\nUltimately, Bogucki believes it was his faith in God and positive mindset that allowed him to endure a level of deprivation that the guidebooks suggest no-one could survive.\n\n\"The simple answer [for how I survived] is by focusing on the good and not the bad \u2014 the life aspect, as opposed to the things that sucked energy from me,\" he says.\n\n\"It came down to believing in God because of the love of life, as opposed to a fear of dying or hell.\"\n\nThose long, hot days and nights in the desert changed Bogucki, instilling a self-awareness and confidence in his ability to endure hardship that would be difficult to replicate.\n\n\"It definitely caused me to slow down \u2026 it helps you identify your ego, that detrimental part of your self-awareness that I had to learn about, and that's always there,\" he says.\n\n\"To be aware of that definitely helps deal with these modern times.\"\n\nBogucki, now aged 59, lives with his partner Janet in a log cabin in remote central Alaska \u2014 not far from where McCandless died.\n\nThis mural at a museum in Fairbanks reflects the local perspective on living in the wilderness. (ABC News: Erin Parke)\n\nHe recognises that many people face adversity and hardship in daily life.\n\n\"Not everyone's going to go for a walk in the desert, or go to the edge of the abyss, but they'll have their own troubles and trials and tribulations,\" he says.\n\n\"I learnt you have a strength you don't know you have \u2026 everyone's got their cross to bear.\"\n\nThe fine line around free will\n\nThe Bogucki saga exposed deep divisions over whether people should be allowed to undertake risky activities in the outback, or be protected from themselves in what's often characterised as a \"nanny state\" intervention.\n\nOpinion pieces published in the wake of his rescue dissected the ideological tension.\n\nOne, by Alaskan outdoorsman Charlie Campbell, captured the culture of staunch individualism that's more pervasive in the US than Australia.\n\n\"[Bogucki's case] raises an interesting question, one with profound moral dilemmas attached,\" he wrote in the Fairbanks Daily Miner.\n\n\"What is society's responsibility to rescue people who may not want to be rescued?\n\n\"We live in an age where more and more a huge safety net is created under most any activity we undertake. The problem with this is it runs counter to a basic human need to exercise free will.\"\n\nHe pointed to the installation of boardwalks and handrails across scenic locations and national parks, \"excessive\" warning signs, and children so buffered from risk they would emerge into adulthood timid and unchallenged by adversity.\n\nCharlie Campbell believes remote areas like where Robert Bogucki lived were ruined by excessive safety measures. (ABC News: Erin Parke)\n\nThe column also suggested a legal disclaimer could be considered for those of sound mind who wanted to undertake high-risk endeavours without intervention by authorities.\n\nIt's an idea supported by Atkinson, who believes society has tipped too far in favour of minimising risk.\n\n\"People end up so risk-averse that they've lost the ability to actually weigh up the positives and negatives of a risk decision, and they're missing out on a heap of positive experiences in nature because of that,\" he says.\n\n\"It's detrimental, especially when parents seem to set this goal that my child shouldn't go through any hardship, whereas really it needs to be: 'What are the suitable risks that they can take, and what are the deliberate hardships that I'm going to allow them to experience in order for them to grow?'\"\n\nInto the Wild bus removed over safety concerns Photo shows Alaska Army National Guard soldiers use a CH-47 Chinook helicopter to removed an abandoned bus. A wrecked bus made famous by a non-fiction book and movie about a North American explorer is removed for tourists' safety.\n\nA 2024 study from the Australian Institute of Family Studies showed the amount of time children under five spend indoors has increased in recent years, with researchers warning it could negatively impact wellbeing and development.\n\nAtkinson is by no means reckless. His wife and children are forefront in his mind, and he says he assesses the dangers of each journey carefully, whether it's sailing a handmade canoe through tropical waters or surviving alone on a remote beach for weeks.\n\nAt times, he's carried a satellite communication device, leaving instructions to contact authorities if he doesn't do a digital \"check-in\" for more than seven days.\n\nBut the 47-year-old former military pilot believes strongly that individuals should retain the right to risk their lives, so long as they're of sound mind and communicating clearly.\n\n\"I've thought a lot about the most responsible way for people to do something like what Robert Bogucki did, and I think an indemnity form is the answer,\" he says.\n\n\"So you can sign a form saying to the authorities: 'Hey, I'm going out bush, and I'm not going to tell you where, because I don't want you to have to feel responsible for searching for me.'\n\n\"You should be able to do that as a kind of basic human right, because otherwise it opens up a whole bag of worms about how much risk you're allowed to take in your own life.\"\n\nIt's the kind of system that could help authorities navigate cases like that of Thomas Seibold, a German man who disappeared in 2012 during an ambitious adventure in remote interior Alaska.\n\nThomas Siebold disappeared around the Ambler area in Alaska in 2012. (Alaska State Troopers)\n\nSeibold was an experienced, resilient survival instructor at an outdoor skills school in Wisconsin.\n\nThe police incident report into his disappearance, obtained by the ABC, states that Seibold had hiked to a remote cabin and planned to stay a couple of months alone to \"spend time with nature\".\n\nHe was due to trek the 40 kilometres out to safety at the start of winter, but was never seen again.\n\nAn inventory of his belongings \u2014 found at the cabin \u2014 included maps, winter clothing, a 0.22 calibre rifle, a moose carcass and a handful of berries.\n\n\"Seibold has been presumed deceased \u2026 he is officially listed as a missing person,\" the police report states.\n\nAnother life likely lost in the pursuit of solitude in the wilderness, in a manifestation of free will that few would choose.\n\nAre ancient survival skills disappearing?\n\nIn Australia, it's becoming harder and harder to be alone in the wilderness to test your skills and enjoy peace and quiet.\n\nEvery year, the spiderweb of sealed road spreads across the outback landscape. And mobile phone reception is expanding across the vast interior, making it difficult to avoid the incessant buzz of notifications.\n\nIt's no doubt a positive for remote residents, for whom the bitumen and bars of reception are a critical link to help in times of crisis.\n\nRemote communities left offline in digital shift Photo shows A phone box with a bright orange roof sits on a dirt road with bushland and a windmill behind it. A national snapshot shows internet access is improving overall, but half the country's Aboriginal communities still don't have phone reception.\n\nBut many, like Bogucki, believe we're less happy because our increasingly safe, suburbanised existence.\n\n\"It's pretty clear that the answer is to get back to respecting the earth and having a connection with it,\" he says.\n\n\"When you're in the city everything's so easy to get \u2026 and when you tear away all that modern world stuff, you can feel the benefits.\n\n\"Your ego drops, you stop looking at yourself in the mirror. Don't take the selfie, don't take your phone out there and take selfies. It's not conducive to the spirit path, and it's not conducive to life.\"\n\nRobert Bogucki believes reconnecting with nature is paramount to a peaceful existence. (ABC News: Erin Parke)\n\nAs technology expands to fill almost every facet of our lives, the promise of the wilderness shimmers like a mirage in our minds \u2014 a place to disconnect, to be alone, and, in as Bogucki puts it, \"strip away the bark to find your essence\".\n\nThis concept of choosing to \"go bush\" for spiritual enlightenment is, in some ways, a privileged perspective.\n\nWhy do we care about some people who go missing, but ignore others? Photo shows A side-by-side image shows young German woman Carolina Wilga and Aboriginal man Clinton Lockyer The miraculous survival of German backpacker Carolina Wilga was met with joy and relief. But for families of missing Aboriginal men, it's prompted uncomfortable questions.\n\nAboriginal people continued to \"survive\" in some of the most challenging wilderness landscapes in Australia until around 50 years ago.\n\nMany still rely on age-old hunting and fishing techniques in places where shops are far away and incomes low.\n\nThey're skills that help people survive when things go pear-shaped out bush.\n\nAnd it's often local Indigenous people who find and help tourists when they become stranded.\n\nJabirr Jabirr and Nyikina man Lindsay Greatorex says older Aboriginal people's knowledge of Australia's remote landscapes is unparalleled and underestimated.\n\nLindsay Greatorex was one of the local police officers who helped search for Robert Bogucki in 1999. (ABC Kimberley: Andy Seabourne)\n\n\"For tens of thousands of years, Aboriginal people built this incredible knowledge of country \u2026 they knew where the soak holes were, they knew the weather and the timing of everything,\" he says.\n\n\"That's how we survived in those arid locations over the years, and there's still this survival instinct of the mob.\n\n\" The landscape might be harsh and look dangerous, but if you're born and raised there, that's your country, and if you look after country, it'll look after you. \"\n\nGreatorex worked as a police officer across Western Australian for almost 20 years, and was part of the local team that went out in search of Bogucki in 1999.\n\nAt times throughout his career, he watched in disbelief as men who'd grown up in the desert used their tracking skills to quickly locate missing people in remote areas.\n\nBut he says the skills are at risk of disappearing, with younger generations largely stuck in towns and unable to learn how to live off the land their ancestors survived in for generations.\n\n\"It's sad to see, and it's why it's so important we do our best to get our kids out bush,\" he reflects.\n\n\"I have a bit of knowledge, but even I get my bush tucker from the supermarket \u2014 it's not like the old days, that's for sure.\"\n\n'Bogucki envy' in the search for meaning\n\nOutback survival makes for riveting viewing because it captures a reality that terrifies most people \u2014 being forced to rely on only yourself as imminent death looms.\n\nAustralians are increasingly buffered from risk, and living longer than ever before.\n\nOutback survival offers a glimpse at an earlier existence that few would want to relive, but one that many suspect offered a sense of focus, purpose and wellbeing many now struggle to achieve.\n\nAs Australian writer Ruth Ostrow observed in an article about Bogucki's disappearance in 1999, the fear of a life unlived haunts those of us fortunate enough to never know how we'd cope in a life -or-death situation.\n\n\"As I stare into Bogucki's eye, I am afraid. Afraid of letting life pass me by,\" she wrote in a piece titled In Search of Peace on Earth.\n\n\"But most of all, I'm afraid that I will never roam barefoot through dusty sand dunes, totally alone with the sound of my heartbeat and the wind, in the wilderness of my soul.\n\n\"We've grown fat on money, food and possessions.

        "text": "Liverpool talisman Mo Salah and substitute Federico Chiesa struck late goals as the Premier League champions began the defence of its title by beating Bournemouth 4-2 in a thriller on the opening night of the season at Anfield on Friday.\n\nOn a bittersweet evening charged with emotion after the July death of Liverpool forward Diogo Jota, newcomer Hugo Ekitike bagged a goal on his league debut to put the hosts ahead after 37 minutes, and Cody Gakpo doubled the lead in the 49th.\n\nBut the night was soured by racist abuse targeting Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo, which led to the game being halted for several minutes after Bournemouth's Ghana international reported the abuse from someone in the crowd.\n\nSemenyo went on to pull a goal back for the visitors in the 64th minute and completed a double 12 minutes later to rock Liverpool and shock the home fans.\n\n\"It's totally unacceptable,\" Bournemouth captain Adam Smith said.\n\n\"Kind of in shock to be honest that it happened. In this day and age it shouldn't be happening.\n\n\"I don't know how Ant's played on to be honest and come up with those goals \u2026 Something has to be done.

(Getty Images: AMA/Robbie Jay Barratt)\n\nChiesa came off the bench and sent the Anfield faithful away happy with an 88th-minute strike after goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic swatted away a ball into the box by Salah, who scored himself deep into added time to wrap up the three points.\n\n\"Fantastic,\" Liverpool boss Arne Slot said of Italian forward Chiesa's goal.\n\n\"He came in in the end because we needed a goal. For him then to score in such a moment is special.\n\n\"It's even more special because the fans have supported him. It's nice he gives them something in return with a great goal.\"\n\nLiverpool's Mohamed Salah was left in tears at Anfield as the fans sang Diogo Jota's song at full-time in honour of the late Reds' striker. (AP: Ian Hodgson)\n\nWith Liverpool ahead again, Salah chased the ball past the defence before cutting inside and firing into the bottom corner with a 94th-minute goal that put the Egyptian joint-fourth with Andy Cole on the all-time Premier League scorers' list with 187.\n\nAn emotional Salah pointed to the heavens and flapped two hands to mimic Jota's shark goal celebration.\n\nHe headed for The Kop stand after the final whistle, and wiped away tears while applauding the fans who were singing their Jota song to the tune of \"Bad Moon Rising.\"\n\nThe night started with an emotional minute's silence for Jota and his brother Andre Silva, who died in a car crash. Fans fought back tears as they sang \"You'll Never Walk Alone.\"\n\nEkitike, who has joined from Eintracht Frankfurt, was the most impressive of Slot's close-season signings in a spending spree topping 300 million pounds ($406.53 million).\n\n\"Obviously I think it was a good performance, I could do better,\" said the French forward \u2014 who held up two fingers in one hand, and made a zero with the other in a tribute to Liverpool's Jota, who wore number 20 \u2014 after his goal.\n\nLiverpool fans held banners and tifo displays at Anfield in honour of the late Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva. (Getty Images: Liverpool FC)\n\n\"But the most important thing was winning, the mentality we showed. Obviously we wanted to win tonight for the people who came and for Diogo,\" added the 23-year-old forward.\n\nReuters/ABC",

(Supplied)\n\nAccording to the FWO, an unpaid trial is a \"demonstration by someone working under supervision to show they have the skills for the job\" and may be unlawful if the person is not under direct supervision.\n\nIn an email seen by the ABC, Mr Vayne was told his trial was unsupervised to assess whether he was suitable.\n\n\"We agreed to a two-hour unpaid trial to ensure you are suitable for the job, hence it was unsupervised,\" the email said.\n\nBroome Beach Resort said claims Mr Vayne or Ms Bidaud were unaware the trial was unpaid or the trial was unsupervised were \"factually incorrect\".\n\nAllegations of threats\n\nMr Vayne said when he raised concern about unpaid trials and working up to eight hours without a break, he and his partner were dismissed \"without valid justification\" and \"barred\" from the site.\n\nHave a story to share? Email Dunja Karagic on dunja.karagic@abc.net.au or securely on dunjakar@protonmail.com\n\n\"The management threatened to report our visas if we continued to demand our rights,\" he said.\n\nIn an email seen by the ABC, the resort told Mr Vayne it did not have his visa details on file. (Supplied/Canva)\n\nWhile Mr Vayne said he had already worked at the resort for more than a week, he was told in an e-mail he had not been paid because the company did not have his visa details.\n\nAccording to the Department of Home Affairs, employers must ensure non-citizens hold a valid visa before they are employed.\n\n\"Actual pay owing, not your blackmailing demands will be forwarded to you and Gabrielle along with your pay slip, once we have received your full documentation,\" the email read.\n\n\" We must be sure you are in Australia working legally. It appears we do not have either of your visa details on file, even though they have been requested. \"\n\nBroome Beach Resort said no employee had been dismissed for raising issues related to entitlements.\n\n\"Both individuals were employed on a casual basis and offered no further shifts for behavioural concerns that made them unsuitable for continued employment,\" the resort said in a statement.\n\nIn response to concerns about their visas, Broome Beach Resort said at the time of onboarding the individuals confirmed they held valid working rights in Australia.\n\n\"We requested supporting documentation multiple times,\" the resort said.\n\n\"They were not rostered beyond initial shifts until documentation was received. There was no intention or attempt to engage workers unlawfully.\"\n\nWhile Ms Vayne and Ms Bidaud have been paid most of their wages, they said the resort still owed them a total of almost 10 hours worked, as well as penalty rates for shifts worked without a break and their unpaid trials.\n\nBroome Beach Resort has rejected claims of unpaid hours or missing penalty rates.\n\nMore claims of withheld pay\n\nMr Vayne eventually decided to publish his story on social media to encourage other backpackers to come forward.\n\nOther backpackers told the ABC Mr Vayne's social media post gave them confidence to share their experiences.\n\nFrench backpacker Michael, who did not want to use his real name for fear it would damage his employment prospects, said he worked more than 30 hours for the resort in April.\n\nBut he said he was not paid until June.\n\n\"For two months, I was sending text messages every week, trying to call \u2026 sending emails \u2026 telling them I will go to Fair Work,\" he said.\n\nA French backpacker says he sent multiple pay requests to the resort.

Gathered visa details and pay slips from backpackers\n\nSpoke to multiple backpackers who worked at Broome Beach Resort\n\nObtained text messages and emails between backpackers and staff at Broome Beach Resort\n\nMichael said it was not until Mr Vayne's social media post went live that he was paid for most of his hours.\n\n\"I received one pay slip [for] 28 hours, so 3 hours and 40 minutes they still owe me,\" he said.\n\nIn response, Broome Beach Resort said the delays were not intentional and any delays were administrative and related to \"missing or incorrect bank or visa details\".\n\nThe resort rejected claims Michael was still owed money.\n\nBackpacker Clara Grassy said she had to repeatedly request payment for 15 hours of work in mid-May.\n\nClara Grassy says she was ignored by Broome Beach Resort when requesting her last pay cheque. (Supplied: Clara Grassy)\n\n\"[Staff] completely ghosted me,\" she said.\n\n\"Because of the pressure they're starting to get thanks to Killian \u2026 [they] finally proceeded with the payment.\"\n\nCalls for more awareness\n\nMr Vayne said he was speaking out to prevent potential exploitation of backpackers.\n\n\"Backpackers are often unaware of their rights, isolated and financially vulnerable,\" he said.\n\n\"Companies know perfectly well if we give our point of view, they'll fire us.\"\n\nMichael said he shared his story to \"prevent backpackers [from] being treated like this\".\n\nFWO denied multiple requests for comment on whether it was investigating complaints against Broome Beach Resort.\n\nA spokesperson said a change to the organisation's media policy meant it could not comment on specific matters unless they were in the public interest.\n\n\"We encourage any workers with concerns to contact us directly for free advice and assistance,\" they said.\n\n'Regulatory gap'\n\nUniversity of Technology Sydney Law Faculty associate professor and Migrant Justice Centre executive director, Laurie Berg, said she had conducted surveys with more than 15,000 temporary migrant workers, many of whom were backpackers.\n\n\"They've told us lots of difficulties they've faced including exploitation and struggling to get redress when they're owed,\" she said.\n\n\"It is unlawful for any employer to withhold pay pending some sort of visa check.\n\n\"Under the law, the employer should not be letting someone start work if their visa documents haven't been checked.\"\n\nMs Berg said her research showed it was a common for backpackers to have to follow up on their pay with employers.\n\nMs Berg says it is common for backpackers to have to chase up their wages. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\n\"I do think across the country, some employers feel they can take advantage of the fact backpackers on temporary visas move around [and] are not in a strong position to follow up,\" she said.\n\nMs Berg said some workers were falling between the cracks due to the FWO lacking resources to follow up all cases.\n\n\"It is not an agency that routinely resolves accounts of exploitation by migrant workers \u2014 it doesn't have the resources to do that,\" she said.\n\n\" I think there is a real regulatory gap here. \"",

        "text": "Less than a year after Western Australia's environmental watchdog was stripped of its powers to assess the emissions of some of the state's most highly polluting projects, environmental advocates and experts say they are concerned the Northern Territory is moving in the same direction.\n\nThe WA Environmental Protection Authority (EPA)'s powers were weakened following a review co-written by its former chair Paul Vogel, which recommended a broad set of changes to environment protection laws that one MP characterised as an industry \"wish list\".\n\nAmong the review's recommendations were that major projects, including mining, oil and gas projects, should only be examined at the federal level using the Commonwealth's \"safeguard mechanism\", to avoid duplication and cut bureaucracy.\n\nMr Vogel is now the chair of the Northern Territory EPA.\n\nThis week, the NT EPA released its new emissions policy, the atmospheric processes guidance.\n\nIt allows the EPA to defer projects to the safeguard mechanism, and cites \"the desirability of avoiding duplication\" with the federal policy \u2014 which, it states, \"in most cases meets the NT EPA's objectives\" for reducing emissions.\n\nWhy some of Australia\u2019s biggest polluters are celebrating this week Photo shows Flare towers with fire coming out of the top. New laws have stripped WA's environmental watchdog of its power to consider carbon emissions when approving high-polluting projects. So is the EPA now a toothless tiger?\n\nCritics have described the new policy as a \"WA blueprint\" and say it could lead to higher emissions, less scrutiny and legal risks.\n\nWesley Morgan, a research associate with the Institute for Climate Risk and Response at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), said WA and the NT had a long history of \"competing with each other to attract large-scale fossil fuel projects\".\n\n\"They're falling over each other to make it easier for gas companies to operate in their jurisdictions, and I think this is another example of that,\" he said.\n\nFederal government best-placed to lead on climate policy, industry says\n\nDavid Slama, the NT director of Australian Energy Producers, which represents the majority of Australia's oil and gas companies, welcomed the NT government's efforts to \"reduce regulatory duplication\".\n\n\"The guidelines bring the NT into line with the Commonwealth and Western Australian governments in recognising climate policy is best addressed at a national level through the safeguard mechanism,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Environment Centre NT (ECNT) executive director Kirsty Howey described the policy shift as \"disgraceful\".\n\nKirsty Howey says the new guidance \"effectively [strips] the EPA of its ability to properly assess the environmental impact\" of projects. (ABC News: Tristan Hooft)\n\nShe pointed to new federal data showing the Northern Territory's emissions have risen by 98 per cent over the past two decades, and said the policy change would only exacerbate the problem.\n\n\"This policy is effectively stripping the EPA of its ability to properly assess the environmental impact of projects, both locally and globally,\" she said.\n\n\"We suspect that we are copying a similar blueprint to WA, which is renowned for being frankly a jurisdiction that takes no responsibility when it comes to the proper regulation of climate impacts.\n\n\"[Previously the policy] required the NT EPA to properly assess the emissions that will be generated by highly polluting projects, and to fundamentally change it in this way, strips back these protections.\"\n\nThe new policy comes after the NT's Country Liberal Party (CLP) government backflipped on its 2030 emissions reduction target in June.\n\nSince coming to power late last year, the CLP has also scrapped the NT's large emitters policy and its target of 50 per cent renewables by 2030.\n\nWarning streamlining processes could open the door to legal risks\n\nThe federal safeguard mechanism is a policy that has been around for years but has been significantly strengthened by the Albanese government.\n\nIt requires big polluters to offset emissions that surpass their annual limit by buying carbon credits.\n\nBut Andrew Macintosh, an environment law and policy professor at the Australian National University, said with carbon prices set \"incredibly low\", the policy had not been effective.\n\nA major study by Professor Macintosh last year found that nearly a third of projects under Australia's carbon credit scheme delivered little or no emissions reductions, despite costing taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nHe also warned that the NT government had opened itself up to legal risks with its policy change.\n\nAndrew Macintosh says the new policy could lead to legal risks. (ABC News)\n\n\"They're trying to streamline processes for the oil and gas companies, and it could end up doing the reverse by opening up opportunities for legal proceedings,\" he said.\n\nMr Morgan agreed, saying a recent decision by the International Court of Justice \u2014 the world's highest court \u2014 could also have significant implications.\n\n\"What they found is that countries need to be properly assessing the impacts on the earth's climate from new fossil fuel projects,\" he said.\n\n\"Countries that continue to open new fossil fuel projects may be committing internationally wrongful acts and so can essentially be sued by other nations for continuing to harm the climate.\"\n\nIn a statement, an NT EPA spokesperson said it would require big polluters covered by the safeguard mechanism to submit information on projected emissions from their project and on emission reduction obligations imposed by the mechanism.",

(ABC News: Guido Salazar)\n\nBut Breakthrough said it was confident it would remain afloat \u2014 and expected its financial position to improve once work began on the new eating disorder facility.\n\nSA Health has confirmed it is in ongoing discussions with Breakthrough about its financial situation.\n\nWork on the centre, located at the Repat Health Precinct, was slated to begin in mid-2025 and take 18 months to complete \u2014 but it has not yet started.\n\nService plagued by years of delays\n\nThe new statewide eating disorder service was first announced in 2019 as a $7.1 million facility, with the former federal Liberal government to contribute $5 million and Breakthrough to fundraise the remainder.\n\nThe project, led by Breakthrough, would be delivered in collaboration with SA Health and Flinders University and include a five-bed residential unit, day program and outpatient clinics.\n\nBut it stalled for five years until the current federal and state governments each contributed another $2.5 million in December 2024, taking the total budget to $12.1 million.\n\nThe top-up came six months after auditors first flagged concerns over Breakthrough's financial position, mentioned in the previous year's audit.\n\nIn 2019, as part of its $2.1 million contribution to the project, Breakthrough announced it had secured a $500,000 donation from mental health and wellbeing charity the Fay Fuller Foundation.\n\nThe new statewide eating disorder service was first announced in 2019 but has been plagued by delays. (ABC News: Guido Salazar)\n\nHowever, the foundation has confirmed it did not go ahead with the donation \u2014 and its formal involvement in the project ended in 2022.\n\nA Fay Fuller Foundation spokesperson did not address questions about why the funding was withdrawn.\n\nA Breakthrough spokesperson said the charity was \"comfortable that interest is sufficient to meet its fundraising contribution towards the project\".\n\nLease to recover costs\n\nAt the end of last year, Breakthrough reported a deficit in equity of $1.94 million, meaning the charity would be short by that amount when repaying its debts if it collapsed.\n\nIt also has a fully drawn $1.59 million loan from the Flinders Foundation.\n\nBreakthrough, which was paid the initial $5 million in government funding in 2022, reported $5.53 million in \"total current assets\".\n\nThe new eating disorder service is to be housed at the Repat Health Precinct. (ABC News: Guido Salazar)\n\nThe charity's spokesperson said accounting regulations meant the $5 million in government funding is currently classed as a deficiency \u2014 but it would \"become positive\" once work on the eating disorder service began.\n\nHe said Breakthrough, as a start-up organisation, had for several years paid out more in grant funding than it received in operating income.\n\nAsked about the loan, he said the Flinders Foundation, which founded Breakthrough in 2020, seeded it with cash to invest in its growth and development.\n\n\"Breakthrough has met its commitments under the loan arrangement to date, and makes provisions for all future payments,\" he said.\n\nBreakthrough also plans to recover costs through a 40-year lease that will require SA Health to pay rent on the centre \u2014 despite taxpayers contributing $10 million for its construction.\n\nThe SA government says Breakthrough has not flagged any issues with them. (ABC News: Guido Salazar)\n\nIn a statement, a SA Health spokesperson said the department would not pay market rent for the site.\n\nIt is understood, under the arrangement, Breakthrough would receive reimbursement for operating expenses such as maintenance and security.\n\nGovernment 'in discussions' with Breakthrough\n\nFollowing initial inquiries from the ABC, made in July, the SA Health spokesperson said standard measures were in place to manage \"scenarios where project requirements are not able to be upheld\".\n\nBut she said Breakthrough had not flagged any issues.\n\n\"We are in regular communication with Breakthrough Mental Health Research Foundation and we're not aware of any issues with respect to Breakthrough's financial position,\" she said.\n\nIn an updated statement, provided on Friday, SA Health said it was now looking into Breakthrough\u2019s financial position.\n\n\"Since the previous statement provided to the ABC \u2026 the Department for Health and Wellbeing and the Southern Adelaide Local Health Network have been in discussions with both the Flinders Foundation and Breakthrough to further understand their financial position and these discussions are ongoing,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nHealth Minister Chris Picton said the government was committed to the delivery of the service.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the federal Department of Health, Disability and Ageing said \"any arrangements between South Australia and Breakthrough Mental Health Research Foundation are a matter for the South Australian government\".",

(ABC)\n\nNow a world away from his \"soulless\" factory job, Michael is imploring autistic people not to let others choose their path for them.\n\n\"If you're given an opportunity, take it,\" he says.\n\nAustin Season Two Photo shows S2 Austin promo Stream all episodes of the brand new season now on ABC iview.\n\nMichael believes his natural strengths \u2014 authenticity, honesty and ability to follow direction \u2014 make him an excellent performer and have allowed him to find success in the acting world.\n\nIt's this strengths-based approach that advocacy groups say is the best path to meaningful employment for autistic people.\n\nFinding the right fit\n\nSharon Fraser, chief executive of Reframing Autism, says most autistic people have deep passions, and when this aligns with their employment, it can be life-changing.\n\nHowever, she stresses the need for workplaces to think differently when it comes to neurodivergence.\n\n\"Many organisations might see employing an autistic person as like charity work, and that's just not the case,\" she says.\n\n\" When autistic people are appropriately accommodated, we bring some really impressive gifts to any workplace. \"\n\nIt's a sentiment shared by George Arkinstall who, with his autistic brother Harry, founded a successful gardening business that employs people on the spectrum.\n\nGeorge says one particular employee has found his passion in gardening and is now studying the field at TAFE.\n\nGardening a Difference aims to be a \"stepping stone\" for people on the spectrum to develop their confidence and pursue their passions. (Supplied)\n\n\"He's wanted to be a sports turf manager since he was in grade 9 \u2026 he knows every lawn mower you point out from down the street,\" he says.\n\nBut George says for other employees, working at Gardening a Difference is about personal growth and development.\n\n\"When people come to our job interviews, they've often experienced rejection from many, many job interviews prior \u2026 [they've also been] ostracised from a very early age and have an awareness of their 'difference',\" he says.\n\n\"You see this almost-like armour, the version of themselves that's protecting themselves. Then, as they meet the team and get into the rhythm of things, they start to open up.\n\n\"Gardening is the medium to learn about teamwork, build skills and build confidence, and that belief in themselves. That affects someone's ability and willingness to put themselves in positions where doors open.\"\n\nBrothers Harry and George Arkinstall co-founded the inclusive gardening business. (Instagram: gardeningadifference)\n\nGeorge says a positive and inclusive work environment can be built in any industry, whether it's car cleaning, data entry or medicine.\n\n\"We have to be careful not to constrain what people on the spectrum can do,\" he says.\n\n\"It's not so much about gardening \u2026 I think it's more about instilling this meaning in people's life.\"\n\nFinding purpose in meaningful work\n\nThis sense of meaning is something Michael is now driven by in his multi-faceted career.\n\n\"My true purpose is being an actor and spreading awareness of my lived experience on the spectrum,\" he says.\n\nAs well as finding personal fulfilment, Michael has enjoyed other benefits like making new friends, having the freedom to travel and not being \"tied down\" to a full-time job.\n\nHe's currently saving up to buy his own home, something he said would be even harder had he not pursued an acting career that pays \"quite well\".\n\nMichael now works as an autism advocate in various capacities, including public speaking. (Instagram: mr_a_plus_michael)\n\nIn addition to his television work, Michael is a public speaker, podcast host, voiceover artist, advocate and now a consultant.\n\n\"Working as an autism consultant allows me to share my story so that other people on the spectrum can accomplish their dreams and goals,\" he says.\n\nHis advice for people on the spectrum is simple: \"Follow your heart.\"\n\n\"If you're going to do something you want to do but you feel too nervous, just take it step by step.\"\n\nSharon from Reframing Autism says Michael's desire to find employment that offers purpose is a universal experience.\n\n\"So many of us get a huge amount of purpose and fulfilment and connection from our work \u2026 it's no different for autistic people,\" she says.\n\n\"We \u2026 place a hierarchy on what jobs are important and what jobs are not important, but if you find your own meaning, your own joy, your own fulfilment from the work that you're doing, then who gives a crap about how society might see that?\"\n\nFear of unknown impeding workplace diversity\n\nBoth Sharon and George say there's some work to do to drive true inclusion, with traditional working hours and a lack of awareness among the challenges.\n\nSharon says full-time work can be unsustainable, and this is reflected in ABS data from 2022, which found almost three in four autistic people with a job work part-time.\n\nSharon Fraser is a late-diagnosed autistic woman and has spent most of her career as a senior finance leader. (Reframing Autism)\n\n\"Entrepreneurship seems to be a really good option for lots of folks. It can give you the flexibility and the sense of achievement,\" she says.\n\n\"It really is that sort of creative problem solving. If you can find that way to connect the thing that brings you joy with a need somewhere: that's the secret sauce.\"\n\nFor George, greater understanding of the autism spectrum is key to building more diverse workplaces.\n\n\"Not enough people are exposed to interacting with people on the autism spectrum growing up, and in different facets of their life,\" he says.\n\n\"When you have two resumes on your desk and one person has autism \u2026 then that fear starts, and people don't engage.\n\n\"That happens over and over again on a large scale within our society. And then all of a sudden, you have these people being left behind.\"\n\nGeorge says every business needs to employ people on the spectrum to avoid creating a society where segregated employment is the norm.\n\n\"We just can't hope for only these people that grew up with people on the spectrum to start businesses and to be able to employ people on the spectrum,\" he says.\n\nStream the new season of Austin now on ABC iview.",

        "text": "At first blush, Suzanne Bradshaw and Greg Ash could be your typical household power consumers.\n\nThey live in a house they built six years ago on a battleaxe block in the inner Perth suburb of Mount Lawley.\n\nLike so many households, theirs is one that increasingly relies on electricity \u2014 from the gadgets under their roof to the solar panels on top of it.\n\nBut look a little closer and a different picture emerges.\n\nIn a workshop attached to the house are a number of kilns \u2014 electric furnaces used by Ash to make glass.\n\nSuzanne Bradshaw and Greg Ash use solar power to help meet the energy needs of their glass furnaces. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\n\"I've been working on glass, this type of glass, for 23 years now,\" the 72-year-old says.\n\n\"So they [the kilns] can consume a fair bit of power.\"\n\nGiven their power needs, the couple have had to take steps to mitigate their exposure to the grid \u2014 and its associated costs.\n\nAsh has worked with glass for two decades. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nThey were early adopters of solar power, forking out more than $20,000 for panels when the technology was still relatively expensive.\n\nIn 2019, when they moved into their new house, they installed an even bigger system and followed it up with a battery a couple of years later.\n\nAnd to round it out, they have signed up for a type of dynamic pricing known as a time-of-use tariff, enabling them to draw dirt cheap power off the grid between 9am and 3pm every day.\n\nBradshaw and Ash spent $20,000 on solar panels to help power their home. (ABC News: Glyn Jones)\n\nIt costs them about nine cents for every kilowatt hour they buy from their retailer during those hours \u2014 but up to 45 cents per kilowatt hour at other times.\n\nTheir household battery helps Ash and Bradshaw to access power outside peak times. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\n\"The good thing about that is if it's an overcast day and you're not getting as much solar coming in, you can top up your battery during the middle of the day,\" Bradshaw says.\n\n\"That also means we're not using electricity during the peak\u2026 that other consumers need.\"\n\nBradshaw and Ash are among the 400,000 small-scale solar customers in WA. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nThe couple's circumstances are increasingly common among Australian consumers.\n\nAustralia has long led the world in its adoption of rooftop solar and Western Australia is no exception.\n\nThere are more than four million small-scale solar installations across the country's homes and businesses \u2014 equivalent to about one in three customers.\n\nRegistrations for batteries under the Commonwealth's small-scale green energy scheme have exceeded those for solar panels for the first time. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nIt's a similar figure in WA, where about 400,000 small-scale customers have solar.\n\nAnd now, courtesy of generous subsidies led by the Commonwealth, uptake of batteries is booming, too.\n\nFor the first time, registrations for batteries under the Federal Government's small-scale green energy scheme exceeded those for solar panels in July.\n\nScratching the surface\n\nA new report commissioned by the office of Brad Pettitt, the leader of the WA Greens, is urging the Cook Government to go much further.\n\nThe report, written by green power advocates Sustainable Energy Now, suggests WA has barely scratched the surface of its rooftop solar capacity.\n\nIt says \"only 13 per cent of the potential capacity\" for rooftop solar has been realised in WA's main grid, which spans the country's south-western corner.\n\nThe report found WA has yet to realise its potential in the solar energy space. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nAnd it notes that of those customers who have solar, fewer than one in 20 have a battery as well.\n\nThe lobby argues that better capitalising on WA's capacity for small-scale solar power and batteries could dramatically cut the need for large-scale projects required as part of the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\n\"Fully utilising suitable rooftops\" could slash the need for wind and solar farms while halving the requirement for new high-voltage power lines and saving billions, it argues.\n\nCrucially, it says small-scale solutions will also be much quicker than large-scale ones, a key advantage given the government's plan to get out of coal power by 2029.\n\nThere's been an uptick in the adoption of household batteries in WA. (August 2025) (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nPettitt says the state's current plan, which relies on large-scale projects, is off track.\n\nBrad Pettitt says the state government should prioritise small-scale solar, instead of big projects. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\n\"The fastest and fairest way to decarbonise is actually utilising our rooftops,\" Pettitt says.\n\n\"There are savings in the billions around needing less transmission.\n\n\"We're saying 'let's get smart about this, using existing rooftops, we don't need to clear vegetation, we don't need to put in new transmission, we can do it now and we can do it quickly'.\"\n\nWhat are the risks?\n\nSelling excess solar to your neighbour could shake up the energy market Photo shows An illustration of rows of houses in blue. One house with panels is connected to the two neighbouring properties. For all Australia's success in adopting rooftop solar, millions of people are missing out. Now a new trial is aiming to overcome that divide through trading.\n\nNot everyone supports the proposal.\n\nGreg Watkinson, the former chief executive of WA's economic watchdog and a director of Electricity Market Advisory Services, says there are risks for consumers in the plan.\n\nHe says there are significant costs incurred by households and small businesses when they invest in solar panels and batteries and many can over-capitalise.\n\nBy contrast, he says there are economies of scale when big businesses invest in large-scale projects such as major batteries and wind farms.\n\nWhat's more, he says those big businesses are sophisticated investors \"who know what they're doing and it's their money to burn \u2014 if they waste it, it's on them\".\n\nGreg Watkinson says solar is not a risk-free energy solution for consumers. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\n\"The risk is that households end up spending too much,\" Watkinson says.\n\n\"If we ended up having solar panels on everyone's roofs, maybe we'd be spending too much.\n\nCan Australia's staggering 'small-scale flex' save our energy future? Photo shows Electricians place solar panels on roof As Australia's energy transition hits turbulence, a quiet but fundamental shift is underway.\n\n\"I expect we would be, so I don't think that's the way to go.\"\n\nWA Energy Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson declined a request for an interview.\n\nInstead, she issued a statement in which she said the government \"recognises the importance of harnessing our vast rooftop solar resource\".\n\nThe Minister noted the government is helping up to 100,000 households to get batteries through its \u2014 albeit watered down \u2014 subsidy scheme.\n\nAsh says investing in solar has been worth the risk. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\nGlass artist Greg Ash thinks he's ahead of the game now he's got a battery along with his solar panels.\n\n\"All you have to do is look at what's happening in the eastern states as opposed to here,\" Ash says.\n\n\"We're better off with our power and gas than they are, but it will come back and bite us here, so people should be looking at solar and battery.\n\n\"And hopefully that will get cheaper for the average person.\"\n\nLoading...",

(ABC News: Pete Mullins)\n\nMore than 99 per cent of properties on the market in Brisbane sold for a profit in the first six months of 2025, according to new data from Domain.\n\nThe median profit from a house sale in Brisbane was $480,000 \u2013 up from $145,000 in 2019.\n\n\"Brisbane\u2019s almost been in this kind of super cycle,\" Dr Powell said.\n\nDr Nicola Powell says the new laws offers a level of transparency for potential buyers.

And if you missed this game, it\u2019s probably one to re-read from the start of the blog today and watch on replay, whether your support Liverpool or Bournemouth or not.\n\nHere\u2019s a wrap-up of the match from Reuters, and keep your eyes peeled for some commentary a little later. Thanks for your company.\n\nLiverpool talisman Mo Salah and fellow forward Federico Chiesa struck late goals as the Premier League champions began the defence of their title by beating Bournemouth 4-2 in a thriller on the opening night of the season at Anfield on Friday.\n\nOn a bittersweet evening charged with emotion after the July death of Liverpool forward Diogo Jota, newcomer Hugo Ekitik\u00e9 bagged a goal on his debut to put the hosts ahead after 37 minutes and Cody Gakpo doubled the lead in the 49th.\n\nBut Antoine Semenyo, who was the target of racist abuse in the first half that led to a pause in the game, pulled one back for the visitors in the 64th minute and completed a double 12 minutes later to rock Liverpool and shock the home fans.\n\nHowever, substitute Chiesa sent the Liverpool faithful away happy with an 88th-minute strike after goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic swatted away a ball into the box by Salah, who scored himself deep into added time to wrap up the three points.",

We do not have a national scheme, and the states and territories administer those schemes. We are looking at a way in which we can get the most efficient outcome, and that is by individual state schemes talking to one another. That\u2019s what we are going to do through the National Checking Capability, and that\u2019s what states and territories have agreed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Childcare Alliance says the move would help close dangerous loopholes but urged further measures, including a national register for early childhood educators and teachers.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump says he and Russian President Vladimir Putin were not able to reach an agreement at talks in Alaska, but he believes progress has been made toward achieving a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe summit has been the first face-to-face encounter for the two leaders since 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile President Trump seemed confident of achieving a deal with Russia prior to the meeting, he now says there are still some key points that need to be addressed first.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's no deal until there's a deal. I will call up NATO in a little while, I will call up President Zelenskyy and tell him about today's meeting. It's ultimately up to them. But we had an extremely productive meeting and many points were agreed to and there are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn't get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Putin praised Mr Trump for helping make diplomatic progress toward peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our talks were held in a constructive and mutually respectful atmosphere, and were very thorough and useful. I would like to thank my American colleague once again for the offer to come to Alaska. It is quite logical to meet here. After all, our countries, although separated by oceans, are in fact close neighbours.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Putin has also suggested the next round of talks could take place in Moscow.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Albanese government has welcomed the diplomatic steps taken by United States President Donald Trump at talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney-General Michelle Rowland tells Channel Seven that all tools must be used to push for an end to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine has been going on for too long and we as a government welcome the United States involvement to try to bring this conflict to a close. Australia stands with Ukraine and any methods and any useful tools that the US could have at its disposal through this meeting is one that we certainly welcome because I'm sure that all Australians want to see this conflict end, as does the rest of the free world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nAn earthquake has struck Queensland with thousands feeling the effects near Australia's east coast.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoscience Australia registered a 5.6 magnitude earthquake near the Wrattens National Park at Kilkivan, about 170 kilometres northwest of Brisbane this morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quake was recorded about 9:50am at a depth of two kilometres.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 6000 people told the agency that they felt the affects of the quake within half an hour.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agency says earthquakes above magnitude five occur every one-to-two years, with an average of 100 quakes at magnitude three or lower recorded each year in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf a century ago then prime minister Gough Whitlam poured a handful of soil into the hands of a man who had led an eight-year protest for the rights of his people\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the 16th of August 1975 Mr Whitlam travelled to Wave Hill Station, about 600 kilometres south of Darwin, to hand back land to the Gurindji people.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the first time the Commonwealth Government had returned land to its original custodians.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the handover ceremony, transferring leasehold title to a parcel of land at the Wave Hill cattle station to Gurindji people, Mr Whitlam poured the soil into the hands of senior Elder Vincent Lingiari.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese says the iconic image of the exchange is an enduring tribute to the courage, determination and solidarity of Gurindji people.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nIn football, Liverpool have beaten Bournemouth in a 4-2 thriller at Anfield in the opening match of the Premier League season.\n\n\n\n\n\nNewcomer Hugo Ekiteke bagged a goal on his debut before Cody Gakpo doubled the lead at the beginning of the second half.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Antoine Semenyo, who was the target of racist abuse from fans in the first half, scored twice in 12 minutes to shock the home fans and level the playing field.\n\n\n\n",

We never give up. And when we win, it won't be by luck. Amen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEight-year-old Axton Hale is getting into the zone behind the chutes.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's praying in a circle with other riders before taking on a bucking bull in the red dirt arena.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Let's go now. Are you ready?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's an organised chaos, with cowboys and cowgirls getting ready before they compete. The chaps are on and pep talks can be heard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's just a fun sport, you get on cool bulls and ride cool bulls. I have some emotions if I fall off I might get a tiny little emotional but I have God with me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAxton is among dozens of young international competitors at the Mount Isa rodeo, which has been around since 1959.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's the first time the event has hosted a junior tri-national competition, with riders from the US, New Zealand and Australia going head-to-head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hi my name is Jacki Gayle and I'm a bull rider on team USA.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 16-year-old is the only female junior bull rider at this year's rodeo - hailing all the way from Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe African American teenager started riding when she was just 11 years old, but it took months to convince her mother that the sport was safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She called me crazy at first and thought that I was going to get hurt; and I wouldn't like it. But I tried and it and here we are four years later. And I've got all my friends and my rodeo family telling me that I can do this. And I don't know, it's just fun.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJacki has earned recognition in various rodeo sanctions and currently holds the title of Southern New Mexico Rodeo Princess.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe recently competed in the Bill Pickett Youth Rodeo - an event in Texas which aims to honour Black rodeo history.\n\n\n\n\n\nJacki admits that growing up, she didn't see many cowboys and cowgirls that look like her - with representation now being an important part of her rodeo journey.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There isn't very many dark skinned or African American cowboys out there. So it's nice for me to be one of the few who are trying to get more awareness and get more people into the sport.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd she's not the only one bringing a unique flare to the arena.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other nation competing against Australia and the USA - is New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Sounds of Hakka dance and chant)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the first day of the rodeo and the sun is about to rise; standing in the empty arena, performing the Haka is the New Zealand team.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading the Haka is Ty Blake, the 16-year-old bull rider attended his first rodeo when he was just 6 weeks old.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rodeo culture is just family, just one big family. Everyone's together, everyone helps each other out. Dad used to show jump way back in his glory days; and Mum's a horsemanship world champion. So I have good genes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the sport has taught him resilience - and fearlessness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a song, called hooked on an 8 second ride and it's about the adrenaline that goes through. And it's something you can't get over. It's like an itch you just got to scratch it and ever since then, I've been scratching it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKylee Ferguson is the director for the youth rodeo organisation; and he helped co-ordinate the international talent for 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we take teams to other countries, we really focus on that team building experience and making friends. To us the most important thing is getting the contacts on the other side of the world. You can see the friendships already formed and spending a lot of time together. I think, it's the best way to make friendships across the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Sound of cows mooing)\n\n\n\n\n\nA growing sport - making way for a new generation of rodeo athletes...\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluding up and coming First Nations bull riders: like 10-year-old Carl Douglas Jnr, who made the journey to Mount Isa from Cape York.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It feels good, sitting on it and riding on it make your family proud. My family was doing bull riding - my cousin, brothers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese young riders, hoping to win some buckles - and lend a hand along the way. Axton again.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Here in Australia we've had 11 plugin electric car battery fires nationally ever. That's the total number that we've ever had. These are primarily due to things like high-speed collisions. We've had several where there's been arson attacks and we've had at least three where electric cars have been in a private home garage and there's been another fire that's spread to the vehicle.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEmma Sutcliffe is the Director of E-V FireSafe, a company funded by the Australian Department of Defence to research electric vehicle [[EV]] battery fires and emergency responses.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says nationally since 2010 there have been 11 road-registered plug-in electric car fires in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there has been a significant rise in fires related to lithium-ion batteries, including small lithium-ion batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Sutcliffe says more recently in Perth, four homes were burnt down in the space of 48 hours in July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Lithium-ion battery fire is known as thermal runaway and in an electric car you may have hundreds or even thousands of separate lithium-ion battery cells. When ne of those gets damaged, it short circuits and it releases a toxic flammable gas, and that gas ignites and then the heat spreads to the next cell and that cell bursts open and off-gases and ignites, and then that spreads to the next cell.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says that chain reaction is very hard to stop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And once thermal runaway starts, it's very difficult to bring it under control or to stop it. So this is the challenge for firefighters - we can't really stop them or runaway in an electric vehicle very efficiently.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Sutcliffe says the most frequent fire danger from electric vehicles lies with e-bikes and e-scooters, which are known to catch fire nationally at least every two days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is because they're often made with poor quality battery cells. There's not a lot of regulation around how those products are built or sold. They take a lot of wear and tear in daily use. And the other challenge is that people bring their e-bike or their e-scooter into their home at the end of the day when they've come home from work or school and they plug it in their lounge room.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says when the fires start in people's homes, the consequences are lethal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've had five fatalities here in Australia from e-bike and e-scooter battery fires, and we are losing homes on a scarily regular basis. In fact, in Perth in July, there were four homes lost to e-bike and e scooter battery fires just in the space of 48 hours.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally over an 18 month period in 2022 to 2023, four entire families were killed by personal mobility devices [[PMDs]] that caught fire in their homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experts say people don't realise that PMD safety requirements are pretty low compared to EVs and home batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmaller items like vapes, power tools and power banks catch fire nationally daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now if your battery pack is looking swollen, if it's unexpectedly hot to touch, so you haven't been charging it or using it, but it feels really hot to touch or if it smells funny, they're some of the early warning signs that that battery may have an issue.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Sutcliffe adds that if someone is experiencing any of those warning signs, then they should take that e-bike or e-scooter out of their home and away from anything flammable.\n\n\n\n\n\nGareth Morgan is the Director at E-V Fire Protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey developed the World's First Electric Under Vehicle Fire Suppression System.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe tells SBS News it's tricky to rely on statistics of electric vehicle fires.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The statistics are very difficult to rely on, and that is because the data that's being captured around the world for electric vehicle fires and the difference of fires where those fires originate from, whether they're just a vehicle fire or a traction battery fire, that data's not actually being captured. So it's a very, very grey area.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe echoes similar sentiment as Ms Sutcliffe, saying its infrequent to get a vehicle battery fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the big challenges that fire brigades certainly around Australia and around the rest of the world, are having on a daily basis, they are attending fires associated with micro mobility devices like scooters and skateboards and like a lot of that is a result of poor manufacturing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Morgan says it's important to follow the manufacturer's guidance for charging the vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's understood that constant rapid charging and charging the vehicle to a very high state is known to be not very good for the battery and could contribute to faults occurring in the future.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australians are switching up where they're travelling to, according to the latest annual report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top five destination countries in 2024-25 were Indonesia, New Zealand, Japan, the US and China.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndonesia \u2014 particularly Bali \u2014 remained at the top, accounting for 14 per cent, or 1,741,370, of Australian trips.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australians are obsessed with Japan, but a new travel hotspot is emerging\n\nJapan also continued its rise, stepping into the third place with 910,640 visitors. The number of trips to Japan has tripled compared with data from 2014-15.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt overtook the US, which dropped to fourth with 746,220 visits \u2014 down from third in 2023-24. The US was the only country in the top five where travel volumes were lower than 10 years ago, with 253,220 fewer trips in 2024-25 than 2014-15, a 25 per cent drop.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina moved up two places to become Australia's fifth most popular travel destination.\n\n\n\n\n\nTen years ago, in 2014-15, the top five countries were New Zealand, Indonesia, the US, the UK and Thailand.\n\n\n\nIndonesia topped the list of Australians' most popular travel destinations yet again, thanks to its island paradise of Bali. Meanwhile, the United States has dropped one place. Source: SBS News\n\nJapan up, US down\n\nAccording to Sara Dolnicar, Professor at the University of Queensland's Business School, the rise in interest in Japan is multifaceted \u2014 including a strong exchange rate, more affordable and shorter direct flights, and cultural motives such as cuisine, scenery and traditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSkyscanner's 2025 travel trends report found that the top factors influencing destination choice were weather (66 per cent), attractions (65 per cent), food (63 per cent) and culture (59 per cent).\n\n\n\nTravel to the United States is 25 per cent lower than 10 years ago, while the number of trips to Japan has tripled compared to data from 2014-15. Source: SBS News On the other hand, Dolnicar says the United States may be seeing a dip in travel interest partly due to political insecurity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't know if it's specifically the Trump administration or whether it's the perceived volatility of decision-making, but there is absolutely no doubt that that has affected international travel into the US,\" Dolnicar said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think for Australians, there is a bit of unease. But I wouldn't say it's that people feel the fear in their bones.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The way consumers operate in their behaviour is that they'll still want to go to New York, but they'll say, 'maybe I'll just wait a couple of years.'\"\n\n\n\nAn increase in travel to China is not necessarily politically motivated either, Dolnicar said. Instead, it's more likely linked to the new policy introduced in November 2024, allowing Australian passport holders to travel in China for 30 days without a visa, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Being able to walk in and get a stamp for 30 days \u2014 that would have had a big effect [on the figures].\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With the US, people might say they love it, but now is not a good time. And now with China, they might have always wanted to check it out and they've made it easier to get in \u2014 so why not?\"\n\n\n\nThe bigger forces shaping travel\n\nWhile destination-specific factors matter, Dolnicar says five broader forces are influencing where Australians go: exchange rates, political insecurities (including safety), natural disasters, the cost of living, and the post-COVID desire for international travel.\n\n\n\n\n\nCost is often the first consideration, especially in a cost-of-living crisis. \"If you've seen that your disposable income is not sufficient, you'll just say that you can't travel that year,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMargy Osmond, CEO of peak industry group Tourism and Transport Forum Australia, said their data indicated two-thirds of the nation were planning a trip, but there was still a \"noticeable drop\" in those who actually took holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That suggests that while the desire to explore remains strong, cost-of-living pressures and economic uncertainty are influencing how and when people travel,\" Osmond told SBS News.\n\n\n\nExchange rates are also having an effect. Dolnicar points to a roughly 25 per cent increase in the value of the Australian Dollar over the Japanese Yen in the last decade: \"It's gigantic. For a dollar now, you get 25 per cent more holiday than you used to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the coin, the Australian Dollar's exchange rate with the US Dollar has fallen by almost 9 per cent over the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nOsmond added: \"While the US remains a bucket-list destination for many Australians, higher costs, a weaker exchange rate and the rising expense of long-haul flights have dampened demand.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's the next hotspot?\n\nOsmond predicts Australians may increasingly choose destinations closer to home, particularly in South East Asia and the Pacific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many travellers are now gravitating towards destinations that offer better value and shorter travel times, particularly across Asia and the Pacific, which has seen some of the US market share shift elsewhere,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While traditional favourites like the US and Europe will remain aspirational, emerging destinations in Asia and the Pacific could enter the top five, and the industry will need to navigate challenges such as affordability, sustainability and seamless border experiences to meet travellers\u2019 expectations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Travel Industry Association's (ATIA) May 2025 travel trends report found Japan had the largest percentage increase year-on-year, with a 38.4 per cent rise, followed by China (+35 per cent) and Vietnam (+26.2 per cent).\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The whole of Asia is very attractive. It's close and it's affordable,\" Dolnicar said. \"Vietnam is kind of an alternative to Indonesia \u2026 it's a little bit more off the beaten track.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Up, up, and away: carbon emissions in the tourism industry on the rise SBS News 06:29 English\n\nBut climate change is also set to make a large impact on where and how Australians travel in the future \u2014 potentially making some destinations less viable and increasing ticket prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some popular ski areas will no longer have snow,\" Dolnicar said. \"That sunny and blue-skied destination might now have rainfall.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe warns that measures such as carbon limits or a mandated use of biofuels \u2014 a more expensive fuel made from renewable sources \u2014 could make overseas travel less affordable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the flight to Bali is suddenly very expensive, you're not going to go,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a real likelihood that we'll need to move back to more local travel because the carbon emissions we generate with the way we're currently travelling is out of control.\"\n\n\n\n",

That's why we are taking action at the national level.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations for a national WWCC scheme were made in the findings of the 2017 royal commission into child sexual abuse.\n\n\n\nRowland conceded the reform had not happened quickly enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All representatives of states and territories are united in the goal of making this system better and making it safer for children, which should be our top priority,\" she told ABC Radio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I acknowledged this has taken too long, but I wish to reassure Australians that ... this is top of the agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What this will mean is that someone who is banned in one state or territory is banned in all states and territories.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRowland said the lack of a national scheme for WWCCs puts young people at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe attorney-general said she was hopeful a national scheme would be in place within 12 months.\n\n\n\nIt comes as a NSW parliamentary inquiry on Thursday was told childcare centres were not checking whether staff were allowed to work with children before they were hired.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inquiry was also told banned workers were able to work in the industry for years without oversight.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal senator Jane Hume said a national scheme should have been implemented with \"more urgency\" when the Coalition was last in government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is the right approach, to get a nationally uniform approach to Working with Children Checks,\" she told Seven's Sunrise program.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaws passed by the federal parliament in July will strip funding from childcare centres not meeting compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation ministers will also meet next week to consider further child safety laws for childcare centres.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the measures being considered are use of CCTV in centres, as well as mandatory child safety training.\n\n\n\n",

And if you missed this game, it\u2019s probably one to re-read from the start of the blog today and watch on replay, whether your support Liverpool or Bournemouth or not.\n\nHere\u2019s a wrap-up of the match from Reuters, and keep your eyes peeled for some commentary a little later. Thanks for your company.\n\nLiverpool talisman Mo Salah and fellow forward Federico Chiesa struck late goals as the Premier League champions began the defence of their title by beating Bournemouth 4-2 in a thriller on the opening night of the season at Anfield on Friday.\n\nOn a bittersweet evening charged with emotion after the July death of Liverpool forward Diogo Jota, newcomer Hugo Ekitik\u00e9 bagged a goal on his debut to put the hosts ahead after 37 minutes and Cody Gakpo doubled the lead in the 49th.\n\nBut Antoine Semenyo, who was the target of racist abuse in the first half that led to a pause in the game, pulled one back for the visitors in the 64th minute and completed a double 12 minutes later to rock Liverpool and shock the home fans.\n\nHowever, substitute Chiesa sent the Liverpool faithful away happy with an 88th-minute strike after goalkeeper Djordje Petrovic swatted away a ball into the box by Salah, who scored himself deep into added time to wrap up the three points.",
