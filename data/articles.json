        "text": "The mother of a NSW woman who died of cervical cancer has told how her daughter spent more than a year trying to get doctors to listen to her concerns.\n\nAmanda Ne'Roi is speaking out about her daughter Jaime's devastating case as three peak research organisations - the Australian New Zealand Gynaecological Oncology Group, Ovarian Cancer Australia and the Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation - join forces to call on the government to commit $100 million in funding towards gynaecological cancer.\n\nAround 19 Australian women a day are diagnosed with a gynaecological cancer, according to December 2024 statistics from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW).\n\nJaime Ne'Roi, pictured with her daughter Indiana. Jaime died in 2023 when Indiana was aged one. (Supplied)\n\nHowever, survival rates for gynaecological cancers have stagnated and fallen well behind improvements for other cancers, such as breast cancer.\n\nIn the 15 years between 1991\u20131995 and 2016\u20132020, the five-year survival rate for women with gynaecological cancers increased by just 6 per cent, compared with 13 per cent for breast cancer, the AIHW data shows.\n\nNe'Roi said Jaime knew something was not right a few months after she gave birth to her second child, Indiana, in May 2020.\n\n\"She was having spotting, discharge, and an upset stomach. She felt sick. She just knew something was wrong,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\nJaime went to her GP, who referred her to a gynaecologist she had seen a decade earlier, when abnormal cells were detected on her cervix.\n\nAt the time, the gynaecologist decided against a hysterectomy because she was yet to have children.\n\nNe'Roi said the gynecologist dismissed her daughter's symptoms because she had recently given birth.\n\n\"He said it was just because she had a baby. He didn't even give her a pap smear test,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\nIt took her daughter Jaime more than a year for doctors to listen to her concerns, her mother Amanda Ne'Roi said. (Supplied)\n\nJaime then went to another gynaecologist, who also attributed the symptoms to her having had a baby and put her on the contraceptive pill, Ne'Roi said.\n\n\"She kept saying to them, there's something very wrong.\"\n\nNe'Roi said she remembered having conversations with Jaime, who was very worried, and telling her to go back to the gynaecologist.\n\nAfter another visit, the gynaecologist agreed to do an internal examination via a laparoscopy in August 2021, which revealed Jaime had stage 3 cervical cancer at the age of 37.\n\n\"By the time she actually got a doctor to listen, she had a seven-centimetre tumour and it was inoperable,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\nJaime underwent radiation and chemotherapy, and briefly received good news in December 2021, when a scan showed up clear.\n\nHowever, by February 2022 the cancer was back and had spread to her uterus and lymph nodes.\n\nA hysterectomy and more chemotherapy and radiation followed, but Jaime's health was deteriorating fast.\n\nThe last option presented by Jaime's doctors was immunotherapy, however, the family was told it would need to foot the bill at a cost of $6000 a fortnight.\n\n\"My husband and I were looking at selling up our property, everything - so were her brothers,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\nWith the money needed immediately, however, the family started an online fundraiser, which allowed Jaime to start the treatment.\n\nThe treatment was not unsuccessful and Jaime died in July 2023, just under two years after she was first diagnosed.\n\nShe left behind her partner and two children, Harrison, then aged six, and Indiana, aged one.\n\n\"The hardest thing I've had to do in my whole entire life was to tell my grandson his mum had gone,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\n\"He burst into tears and said, 'I just want my mommy back.'\"\n\nJaime Ne'Roi died two years after she was diagnosed with stage three cervical cancer. (Supplied)\n\nRates of cervical cancer have been increasing in Australia, despite the national rollout of the HPV vaccine in 2007, which provides some protection against the cancer-causing virus.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2024, incidence rates of cervical cancer have climbed from 5.5 cases per 100,000 people to 8, AIHW data shows.\n\nNe'Roi said Jaime had been vaccinated for HPV, which showed why women should not become complacent about the disease.\n\n\"I think the trouble is, people become very complacent about gynecological cancers, they aren't mentioned much. Breast cancer is huge,\" Ne'Roi said.\n\n\"I'm sharing this story to illustrate the hidden crisis impacting all Australian women, because it can hit any one of us at any time.\"\n\nMore money was desperately needed for research for all gynecological cancers, Ne'Roi said.\n\nProfessor Clare Scott, Australia New Zealand Gynaecological Oncology Group (ANZGOG) chair, said gynecological cancers had been left underfunded for decades and were a hidden crisis that was expected to grow.\n\nGynecological cancers - which include uterine, ovarian and cervical cancers - are predicted to surge by 21 per cent over the next 10 years.\n\n\"For too long, gynaecological cancers have been overlooked and underfunded, leaving women with limited treatment options and unacceptable survival rates,\" Scott said.\n\n\"These are not just statistics - they are our mothers, sisters, daughters, wives, and friends... we must do better.\"\n\nANZGOG, along with Ovarian Cancer Australia and the Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation, are seeking $100 million in federal government funding over four years to go towards more personalised treatments for patients, clinical education, a national research databank and drug trials.\n\n\"The survival rates for gynaecological cancers have barely changed in decades. That fact alone should be a wake-up call,\" Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation CEO Robin Penty said.\n\n\"We know that the answers are there \u2013 they lie in research and in better understanding of women's bodies and women's pain. To reveal them we need appropriate and proportionate investment.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Health Minister Mark Butler said he would continue discussions with the ANZGOG about their proposal.\n\n\"The Albanese Labor government is doing all we can to support patients, families, loved ones and carers on the cancer journey,\" the spokesperson said.",

This will only apply for the 2025-26 financial year.\n\nPeter Dutton has been visiting plenty of petrol stations to push his proposed cut to the fuel excise. (James Brickwood/SMH)\n\nEnergy\ufeff and climate\n\nPerhaps the most significant policy difference between the two major parties is on energy, thanks to the Coalition's push for Australia to embrace nuclear power . \ufeff\n\nLabor\n\nLabor has pledged to extend the energy bill rebates rolled out in the 2024 budget for another six months , providing households with an extra $150 in savings.\n\nIt will continue to roll out renewables to meet Australia's energy needs, with the goal of solar and wind making up 82 per cent of the grid by 2030, with gas and other fossil fuels \"firming\" up supply.\n\nIt's also announced a $2.3 billion fund to cut the cost of installing battery storage by 30 per cent.\n\nLabor has existing emissions reductions targets for 2030 and 2050 (a 43 per cent cut and net zero respectively), but hasn't committed to a 2035 goal. \ufeff\n\nREAD MORE: The severe penalties for anyone caught voting twice \ufeff\n\nLabor's energy policy is focused on expanding the rollout of renewables. (Wolter Peeters/SMH)\n\nCoalition\n\nThe centrepiece of the Coalition's energy plan is its proposal to construct seven nuclear reactors around the country.\n\nIt says all of the plants would be operational sometime in the 2040s, and would cost $331 billion \u2013 although the modelling used for that figure relies on Australia needing and producing significantly less energy than Labor's plan.\ufeff\n\nIt is also planning to ramp up gas production to meet the energy shortfall in the interim as coal plants shut down and the reactors are built\ufeff, announcing a $1 billion fund for infrastructure expansion.\n\nOpposition leader visits 14th servo of election campaign View Gallery\n\nIt will also introduce an east coast gas reservation , forcing local producers to keep more gas in Australia instead of selling it overseas, and fast-track approval for the North West Shelf gas expansion.\n\nThe Coalition has not set emissions reduction targets. While it has previously talked of scrapping and reviewing Labor's 2030 goal, it says it is committed to net zero by 2050 and the emissions reduction targets Australia signed up to at the Paris climate conference.\n\nThe Coalition has also pledged to repeal the New Vehicle Efficiency Standard, which encourages car makers to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles and penalises companies that exceed a set emissions cap.\n\nThe Coalition is proposing a shift to nuclear energy. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\n\nHealth\n\nLabor has leant heavily into health \u2013 particularly Medicare \u2013 during the campaign, seeking to target Dutton for his previous stint as health minister.\n\nLabor\n\nLabor will also spend $644 million to expand the Medicare urgent care clinic network with 50 new centres, and $1 billion to build or upgrade dozens of walk-in mental health facilities and train 1200 new workers in the sector.\n\nMedicare has been at the heart of Anthony Albanese's re-election pitch. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nCoalition\n\nFor the most part, the Coalition has matched Labor's big health policies, promising to back the $8.5 billion Medicare funding and cut to PBS medicine costs.\n\nOn mental health, it is promising $400 million for youth services, and will permanently reintroduce the pandemic-era policy for 20 subsidised mental health sessions for people with a mental health care plan\ufeff, up from the current 10.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation is another area \ufeffthat Labor has sought to target, particularly in relation to childcare and student debt.\n\nLabor\n\nLabor has promised to forgive $16 billion in student debt on June 1 \u2013 a 20 per cent cut for everyone with an outstanding HECS-HELP or other similar loan.\n\nIt will also establish a $1 billion fund to build and upgrade 160 childcare centres, in addition to its move to provide three days of subsidised childcare for all families .\ufeff\n\nLabor will also continue to provide fee-free TAFE places.\ufeff\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition will set a target of having 400,000 apprentices and trainees and incentivise businesses to provide those positions.\ufeff\n\n\ufeffWorkplace\n\nA focus on workplace policies has somewhat faded as the campaign\ufeff has progressed.\n\nLabor\n\nLabor will ban non-compete clauses for workers earning less than $175,000 a year to make it easier for people to change jobs. It is also promising to protect penalty rates in legislation if re-elected.\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition has promised to shrink the size of the public service by 41,000 workers over five years through a hiring freeze, natural attrition, and offering voluntary redundancies.\n\nIt is also offering up to $20,000\ufeff in tax deductions for small businesses to spend on staff meals and entertainment.\n\nIt has previously promised to repeal the right-to-disconnect \ufefflaws introduced in the last parliament, although has said it would keep Labor's same job, same pay legislation.\n\nIt had been promising to force public servants back to the office, but scrapped that policy one week into the campaign .\ufeff\n\nREAD MORE: The 10 closest seats heading into the election \ufeff\n\nBoth parties have a small handful of policies focused on workplaces. (Louie Douvis/AFR)\n\nCrime\n\nAs a largely state-controlled issue, crime hadn't been a major talking point until late in the campaign due to an Easter Monday announcement by the Coalition .\n\nLabor\n\nLabor largely wasn't drawn on the Coalition's crime announcement, pointing to its own policies it enacted during the last term, including introducing a child sexual offender registry and a crackdown on illegal tobacco being imported into Australia.\ufeff\n\nIt also made the first domestic violence pledge of the campaign: $8.6 million in funding for \"innovative \" management of perpetrators, as well as a crackdown on financial abuse .\ufeff\n\nCoalition\n\nThe Coalition \ufeffpromised to allocate $750 million in funding for a range of crime policies, including trialling a new child sex offenders disclosure scheme, an AFP strike force to target illicit drugs, and a national antisemitism taskforce led by the AFP.\n\nIt also said it would standardise knife laws and roll out detector wands across the country in conjunction with the states and territories.\n\nIn a later announcement, it \ufeffpromised $90 million for domestic violence prevention and response , including setting up a notional offenders registry.\n\nREAD MORE: How independents will shape the federal election \ufeff\n\nDefence spending was brought up late on in the campaign.

        "text": "The death of Pope Francis on Easter Monday has set in motion a series of ancient rituals that will culminate in his funeral on Saturday.\n\nBut it will not follow traditional protocols, making a break from the past as the world mourns the loss of the \"people's pope\".\n\nHere's what we know about the funeral of Pope Francis.\n\nWhen is the pope's funeral?\n\nThe pope's funeral will take place on Saturday, April 26 \u2014 six days after his death.\n\nIt will begin at 10am local time. That's 6pm AEST for Australians on the east coast.\n\nWhere will it be held?\n\nFrancis's funeral will be held outside in St Peter's Square, weather permitting.\n\nPrevious papal funerals have also been held outside, with thousands of mourners filling the open space in front of the basilica.\n\nFrancis's funeral liturgy will be presided over by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, dean of the College of Cardinals \u2014 the group which will in the coming weeks be tasked with appointing a new pope.\n\nInside Pope Francis's final days Photo shows A man in religious garb sitting in front of a red curtain, looking on As he glided around St Peter's Square in his Popemobile on Sunday, the fact he was 88 and had just spent several weeks in hospital somehow seemed a distant memory. Then everything changed.\n\nHow to watch\n\nABC NEWS will broadcast the funeral as part of its live coverage on Saturday.\n\nCoverage will also be blogged live right here on the ABC NEWS website and a stream will be available on YouTube.\n\nVatican Media will offer a live stream on YouTube and its official websites.\n\nWhere will the pope be buried?\n\nA pope known for defying expectations, Francis will continue this trend in death.\n\nHe will become the first pontiff to be buried away from the Vatican in more than a century.\n\nIn his final testament, dated June 29, 2022, Pope Francis requested he be buried at Rome's Basilica of Saint Mary Major.\n\nThroughout his life, Francis has always entrusted himself to the Virgin Mary.\n\n\"For this reason, I ask that my mortal remains rest \u2014 awaiting the day of Resurrection \u2014 in the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major,\" the will read. \"The tomb must be in the earth; simple, without particular decoration and with the only inscription: Franciscus.\"\n\nThe last pope to be buried there was Clement IX in 1669.\n\nInside the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, where Pope Francis has decided to be buried. (Reuters: Guglielmo Mangiapane)\n\nThe Unesco World Heritage site is one of the Italian capital's four major papal basilicas, and has played a key role in Francis's history since he was elected in 2013.\n\nLess than 24 hours after he became pope, Francis visited the basilica to pray in front of one of the Catholic world's most important icons of the Virgin Mary, the Salus Populi Romani \u2014 meaning Salvation of the Roman people.\n\nHe would regularly travel to St Mary Major before leaving on trips abroad and upon his return to Rome.\n\nWho will attend?\n\nTens of thousands of people are expected to attend the funeral.\n\nA string of world leaders have confirmed they will travel to the Vatican for the service.\n\nHere's a list of some of the attendees:\n\nArgentinian president Javier Milei\n\nItalian prime minister Giorgia Meloni\n\nBrazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva\n\nFrench president Emmanuel Macron\n\nBritian prime minister Keir Starmer\n\nUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy\n\nUS president Donald Trump and his wife Melania\n\nBritain's Prince William will also be attending on behalf of his father King Charles.\n\nAustralia will be represented at the funeral by Governor-General Sam Mostyn and the ambassador to the Vatican, designate Keith Pitt.\n\nThe list will also include federal trade minister Don Farrell and former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack.\n\nPrime minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition leader Peter Dutton will not attend as the election enters its final week.\n\nAll of the 252 Catholic cardinals will be invited to attend.\n\nUkrainian-born Melbourne cardinal Mykola Bychok will also be at the funeral. He is one of the 135 cardinals from around the world eligible to take part in the conclave.\n\nLoading...\n\nHow does the pope's funeral work?\n\nIn 2024, Francis revised various papal funeral rites and rituals to cut back on a lot of the associated pomp and pageantry.\n\nExplaining the changes, Archbishop Diego Ravelli, master of Papal Liturgical Ceremonies, said that the aim was to highlight that the pope's funeral is \"that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ, and not of a powerful man of this world\".\n\nFor example, traditionally, a deceased pope was laid to rest inside three stacked coffins made of cypress wood, lead and oak.\n\nHowever, after the changes enacted by him last year, Francis's body is being placed inside a simplified wooden coffin lined in zinc.\n\nDuring Pope John Paul II's funeral, the service began with the great bells of St Peter's Basilica tolling in mourning.\n\nThen 12 pallbearers carried John Paul's coffin out of the church. The choir sang the Latin prayer: \"Grant him eternal rest, O Lord, and shine your light on him forever.\"\n\nThe coffin was then laid on the steps of the vast church.\n\nSaturday's two and a half hour service will likely be led by Cardinal Battista Re.\n\nCardinal Giovanni Battista Re also led former Pope Benedict's funeral in St. Peter's Square. (Reuters: Guglielmo Mangiapane)\n\nHe will lead those present in prayers and Bible readings, and will deliver the final commendation and valediction \u2014 a concluding prayer where the Pope will be formally entrusted to God.\n\nThe funeral will be held in different languages. It's likely that the main prayers will be said in Latin and Italian.\n\nPatriarchs, cardinals, archbishops, bishops and priests from across the globe will take part.\n\nThe event requires a huge security operation.\n\nAn estimated four million people thronged the streets of the Vatican during John Paul II's funeral in 2005, alongside 8,000 security staff members.\n\nAfter the funeral, the pontiff's body will be moved to St Mary Major for the burial.\n\nA nine day mourning period, known as Novemdiales, will then begin.\n\nWhen will the conclave happen?\n\nFollowing the funeral, a conclave of cardinals will convene to elect a successor.\n\nWe don't have an exact timing on that yet.\n\nWho could be the next pope? Photo shows Pope Francis grinning while wearing white robes and a silver Catholic cross chain and waving with his left hand Speculation is swirling about who could be the new leader of the Catholic church. But the secretive nature of papal elections means it's hard to pick a single frontrunner.\n\nBut the dean of the College of Cardinals has 15 to 20 days to summon the cardinals to Rome after the pope's death where they meet in the Sistine Chapel to begin the decision-making process.\n\nOnly cardinals under the age of 80 have a say in the decision and the voting takes place behind closed doors.\n\nIt typically takes from days to weeks for a pope to be chosen, though it can stretch slightly beyond that.\n\nOf the cardinals eligible to appoint the next pontiff, Pope Francis installed 108.\n\nThe last three popes were chosen within days.",

        "text": "Smear campaigns, politicking, gossip and blackmail: Conclave had it all.\n\nThe film about the death of a fictional pope and the election of a new papal leader was an awards-season favourite.\n\nAnd now, as Catholics around the globe mourn the death of Pope Francis, that election process begins in the real world too.\n\n\"I had grown up in a Catholic family [and] uncles of mine work as Catholic priests and theologians,\" Conclave's lead actor, Ralph Fiennes, told the ABC.\n\n\"So my instinctive thing was, 'Please, please can we get this right? Can the details be accurate?'\"\n\nAnd as life imitates art in the weeks to come, the film will act as a reference point for many of us outside the secretive process.\n\nWe sat down with Darius von Guttner Sporzynski, a historian and the dean of the Australian Catholic University's Canberra campus, to see if Fiennes got his wish.\n\nWhat happens when the pope dies?\n\nIn Conclave, we follow Fiennes' character, Cardinal Lawrence, in the aftermath of a fictitious pope's death.\n\nWhen a pope passes away or resigns, a 'vacancy of the Apostolic See' is declared. The rules around what happens next are set out in Vatican legislation, updated by Pope John Paul II in 1996.\n\nProfessor von Guttner Sporzynski says the film mirrors this legislation \"almost to the letter\".\n\nConclave's cast and crew aimed for accuracy with every detail. (Supplied: Roadshow)\n\nNine days of mourning follow the death, cardinals arrive at the Vatican from around the world, and the conclave \u2014 the meeting central to the election process for the new pope \u2014 must begin within 20 days.\n\nFiennes' Cardinal Lawrence is a fictional Dean of the College of Cardinals, the person who must oversee the conclave.\n\nThe current real-life dean is Giovanni Battista Re; however, the 91-year-old will not be able to run the conclave, as participation is restricted to cardinals under 80.\n\nWith the vice dean (Cardinal Leonardo Sandri) also over 80, the running of the conclave usually falls to the most senior eligible cardinal bishop, Cardinal Pietro Parolin.\n\nWhat Pope Francis has revealed about the conclave\n\nMuch of the film centres on factional tensions and smear campaigns among the cardinals, who have differing views on the future of the church.\n\nProfessor von Guttner Sporzynski says just how much this has been dramatised for entertainment is up for debate.\n\n\"There are no written minutes that are given to us to suggest how these meetings unfold,\" he says.\n\nFor him, the film excels in showing the human side of a deeply spiritual process, where cardinals have their own likes, dislikes, ideologies, flaws and vices.\n\nWhile director Edward Berger calls Conclave a \"thriller that takes us behind the Vatican doors\", he says it's really about \"Ralph Fiennes' inner journey\". (Supplied: Roadshow)\n\nPope Francis himself (then Jorge Bergoglio) revealed a group of cardinals \"used\" him in the 2005 conclave in an attempt to block the election of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.\n\nIn his book The Successor, the late Pope said he received 40 out of 115 votes, but the intention wasn't to elect him. Instead, the group aimed to prevent a 'foreign' pope, hoping to force a compromise candidate after knocking the German Cardinal Ratzinger out of the running.\n\nRaised in Argentina but ethnically Italian, Pope Francis announced he would refuse the role, and Cardinal Ratzinger was elected as Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nThe Vatican and the Santa Marta residence\n\nIn Conclave, like in the real world, cardinals are sequestered to the Vatican throughout the election, so they are not unduly influenced by the outside world.\n\nListen to the podcast Photo shows The Screen Show Jason Di Rosso interviews the makers of the movies and TV you need to see.\n\nThe Vatican is, however, off limits to any and all film and television production.\n\nFilming was therefore limited to historic buildings across Rome, but cast members were given an exclusive tour of the Sistine Chapel.\n\n\"We went to the Vatican and got to see a little bit behind the scenes, what most people would not normally be able to see,\" actor Stanley Tucci told The Screen Show's Jason Di Rosso.\n\n\"That alone is impressive. I mean, the Sistine Chapel is, of course, an extraordinary thing, and to have access to it the way we did \u2026 was great.\"\n\nDirector Edward Berger says while they were \"inspired\" by the real Casa Santa Marta \u2014 where cardinals live during the conclave \u2014 they \"designed it a little bit, because it is so spare and actually looks quite boring, it's not very cinematic\".

(Supplied: Roadshow)\n\nIn the film, the scrutineers pierce the ballots with a needle and red thread after they've been counted, binding them together and adding to the drama.\n\n\"In the past, the death of a pope was confirmed by \u2026 knocking a tiny silver hammer into the forehead of the deceased,\" Professor von Guttner Sporzynski says.\n\n\"That used to be the tradition. We don't do this anymore; medical practitioners now confirm the person is dead.\n\n\" Do they [still] use the thread to do the needle thing? I don't know. Maybe yes, maybe not. But it looks very good in the movie. \"\n\nHe says cardinals cast two ballots each morning and two each afternoon, until a consensus of two-thirds majority is reached.\n\nSmoke from the Sistine Chapel's chimney is still the first notification the public have about the conclave's results.\n\nBlack smoke means a failed vote, while white smoke signals there is a new pope.\n\nProfessor von Guttner Sporzynski says originally this was achieved by burning the ballots themselves, with the addition of wet straw to create white smoke.\n\nThese days, as in the film, the colours are achieved with chemicals.\n\nFactional tensions heighten the drama in Conclave. (Supplied: Roadshow)\n\n\"Essentially, Pope John Paul II put all these new rules in the [Vatican] legislation because he participated in two conclaves and he understood that the old rules were slightly too cumbersome,\" Professor von Guttner Sporzynski explains.\n\nHe says these practical, logistical concerns find a balance with spirituality in the conclave process.\n\n\"Catholics believe it is inspired by the higher power and like [they say] in the movie: If there was no mystery, there wouldn't be a need for faith.\"\n\nConclave is streaming in Australia (to rent or buy) on Prime Video, Apple TV, Google TV or YouTube.",

(ABC News: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nNambour RSL sub-branch president Wes Davidson described the cancellation of the service as \"very disappointing\".\n\n\"We planned for a long time \u2026 and put so much effort into this over the past three or four months,\" he said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this morning I just had to make the call.\"\n\nMr Davidson said even if floodwaters had receded in time, the amount of mud and the slippery ground left behind would have rendered the area unsafe.\n\nOrganisers of the Nambour dawn service are beginning the mammoth task of trying to find the 280-odd chairs that were washed away in the flash flooding. (ABC News: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nThe power and speed at which the water rose were evident from how many chairs floodwaters had managed to wash away.\n\nThree hundred chairs had been stacked up overnight, ready to be laid out this morning.\n\nBut once the waters receded this morning, only 20 remained.\n\nThe downpour comes after Nambour was hit with intense flash flooding during ex-Tropical Cyclone Alfred.\n\nSome of those chairs ended up in trees after a \"disappointing\" cancellation of the Nambour dawn service. (ABC News: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nIn Buderim, the dawn service was also cancelled due to poor weather conditions this morning.\n\nQueensland Fire and Rescue crews performed two swift water rescues in the early hours of this morning after people became trapped in their vehicles.\n\nIn Nambour, a single occupant of a car was helped to safety after they became trapped in floodwaters around 6am.\n\nWhile in Buderim, another single occupant of a vehicle was helped to safety after entering floodwaters on Crosby Road around 5am.\n\nNambour residents woke to flash flooding. (Facebook: Sarah Ann)\n\nQueensland Ambulance Service was also called to Nambour around 3:30am to reports of a man who had become trapped in floodwaters in his vehicle.\n\nHe had freed himself by the time emergency services arrived and was transported to hospital in a stable condition.\n\nTwo women were also taken to hospital after two separate lightning strikes.\n\nOne female patient was taken to Caboolture Hospital with minor burns after lightning hit a property in Burpengary around 3am while another woman was taken to Nambour Hospital with neck pain after lightning struck a property on Yandina Bli Bli Road just before 1am.\n\nRough sleepers' tents washed away\n\nIn Nambour, flash flooding at Petrie Creek washed away a number of tents where homeless people had been living.\n\nTents and possessions were washed away in the flash flooding. (ABC News: Jennifer Nichols)\n\nPastor Dale Dowler, who runs the community and homeless shelter The Shack in Nambour said there had been devastation and shock this morning after the latest round of flash flooding.\n\nHe estimated it was the fifth or sixth time that particular part of town had flooded in the past 12 months.\n\nPastor Dale Dowler works to prepare emergency supplies after the latest round of flash flooding. (ABC News: Jennifer Nichols)\n\n\"Some people have lost all of their clothes,\" he said.\n\n\" They've lost everything ...

(Supplied: Chris Richards)\n\nApiam Animal Health chief executive Chris Richards said he lodged his application on March 14, it passed the preliminary assessment two days later, and was told by the APVMA he would hear back within two weeks.\n\nHe said he had been waiting for six weeks.\n\nHe said the company had the capacity to vaccinate 50,000 sows within two weeks of emergency approval.\n\n\"We haven't \u2026 really been notified that there are any deficiencies in the application,\" he said.\n\n\"But also haven't been updated as to when that might be processed.\n\n\"If we got an emergency use permit today, we'd be able to vaccinate most of those sows that are in the affected areas in the next two weeks.\"\n\nFeeling forgotten\n\nFarmers have been told their best defence is mosquito controls as JEV spread in Queensland.\n\nThe most recent detection was at the Betta Pork facility in Biloela.\n\nDirector Laurie Brosnan said he was following industry best practice to keep his piggery safe, but it was not enough without an effective vaccine.\n\nHe said Betta Pork had an independent contractor who sprayed open waterways, puddles, and other areas \"at a considerable cost\".\n\n\"We also treat the animals to protect them against JEV,\" he said.\n\n\"It's just unfortunate that there's only so much you can do.\"\n\nLaurie Brosnan says he is frustrated with the wait for a vaccine. (Supplied: Laurie Brosnan)\n\nHe said he felt his industry had been forgotten.\n\n\"I can't help but feel that the pig industry is not front of mind,\" he said.\n\n\"I understand we're in election time, and politicians make promises as they do.\n\n\"I still feel that the government isn't prioritising or even giving the pig industry a fair go.\"\n\nTop concern\n\nAustralian Pork chief executive Margo Andrea said JEV was a top concern for the industry.\n\n\"The previous outbreak in 2022 cost the industry millions of dollars and significantly impacted operations for piggeries across four states,\" she said.\n\n\"Three years later, JEV continues to contribute to losses for producers and their communities.\n\n\"We will continue pushing for a vaccine that will help keep our herds safe and healthy and help safeguard our producers' livelihoods.\"\n\nGrowing need\n\nUniversity of Queensland Associate Professor Jody Peters, who oversaw the development of one of the vaccines, said there was enough data to show that it was safe and effective.\n\nJody Peters (right) looks at cells used for vaccines with Jessica Harrison. (Supplied: University of Queensland)\n\nDr Peters said her team started working on it as soon as they were notified of the first JEV outbreak in Australia in early 2022.\n\n\"The initial trials occurred at the end of 2022, and some additional trials occurred in 2023,\" she said.\n\n\"I think we have got sufficient data to prove that it is effective, and it is safe.\n\n\"But, ultimately, it is up to the regulatory bodies to determine whether we have produced enough data to date.\"\n\nDr Peters said the need for a commercially available vaccine was growing.\n\n\"With all of the flooding that's occurred recently, the mosquito that is likely the culprit for transmitting the virus would have bred up huge populations,\" she said.\n\n\"I am incredibly frustrated, as are pig farmers, with how long it is taking to get these approvals across the line.\n\n\"But I do believe that we will have a vaccine on the market in the future.\"",

I didn't really have anything else.\"\n\nKinder threw herself into university fulltime \u2014 \"hated it\" she said \u2014 before the siren call of the pool landed her back in training.\n\n\"When Fukuoka [world championship 2023] trials rolled around, I saw that they were going to be in Melbourne,\" Kinder says.\n\n\"So I texted Craig [Jackson] and I was like, 'Hey, do you wanna take me back?'\n\n\"And I came back.\"\n\nKinder says the time away, during which she studied, moved out of home and moved back in again, helped focus her mind.\n\n\"I experienced it all and just realised that I didn't really feel like I had a drive towards something,\" Kinder says.\n\n\"I wasn't the biggest fan of uni so it wasn't like a career-focused passion, so I thought moving back into swimming could be something to look for.\n\n\"And then the first few months back swimming it was a lot more fun than it's ever been before. So I thought I'd stick with it.\"\n\nRamsay thrilled with new coach Marshall\n\nElla Ramsay swam in three individual events at the Paris 2024 Olympics. (Getty Images: Chris Hyde)\n\nRamsay too has had to refocus over the past year.\n\nFollowing her excellent Olympic performance, Ramsay enjoyed a well-earned couple of months off before returning to the pool \u2014 and it appears to have paid off.\n\n\"Coming off the Olympics I had a really big physical and mental break,\" Ramsay explains.\n\n\"Not that I like to compare, but comparing to this time last year, I'm actually some of my events were fast. So it's so it's nice to see that and reflect on that.\"\n\nPart of that may be down to new coach Mel Marshall, who has taken over at Griffith University after Michael Bohl stepped away.\n\nElla Ramsay credited Mel Marshall for helping her back up after the Olympics. (Getty Images: Chris Hyde)\n\n\"We have a good group down there, a good environment and she's [Marshall's] been really good. I can't thank her enough,\" Ramsay says.\n\n\"Coming off the Olympics, it's hard for anyone, but she's got me back into peak performance I'd say, both mental and physical, so I'm very thankful.\"\n\nEven if that means doing two extra swims on what is supposed to be a day off, with Ramsay swimming the 200m freestyle and 200m backstroke on Thursday.\n\n\"Mel gave me heaps of events,\" Ramsay says with a huge grin.\n\n\"Today was supposed to be a day off, but she gave me the 200 free and 200 back instead, so very nice of her.\"\n\nNow, both women will focus on qualifying for the world championships at the trials in Adelaide in June.\n\nThere, they will likely be competing for the same spot on the team, with Olympic medallist Kaylee McKeown a shoo-in for the lead spot.\n\nMcKeown pulled out of the 200m medley on Easter Monday and withdrew from the championships entirely on Thursday after announcing on Instagram that she would be leaving Griffith University to train back at the USC Spartans club on the Sunshine Coast.\n\nKaylee McKeown will be a favourite to swim the 200m medley in Singapore. (Getty Images: Chris Hyde)\n\nThe five-time Olympic gold medallist, who won bronze at the 2024 Paris Games in the 200m IM, will almost certainly race the event in Singapore.\n\nBut with this burgeoning rivalry?

He is preparing to pay $US40,000 ($63,000) to a Chinese company for a robotic arm with a camera. The device uses artificial intelligence to observe how a worker welds the sides of an oven, and then duplicates the action with minimal human intervention. Only four years ago, the same system was available only from foreign robot companies and cost nearly $US140,000. \u201cBefore, I never would have imagined investing in automation,\u201d Li said, adding that a human employee \u201ccan only work for eight hours a day, but a machine can work 24 hours.\u201d A robot sorts lug nuts before attaching wheels to electric cars at a Zeekr plant in Ningbo, China. Credit: Qilai Shen/The New York Times Bigger companies bet far more on automation. In Ningbo, a huge factory for Zeekr, a Chinese electric carmaker, had 500 robots when it opened four years ago. Now there are 820, and many more are planned.\n\nCheerfully trilling Kenny G tunes to warn any people of their approach, robot carts haul aluminum ingots to an automated elevator, which lifts the blocks of metal to a furnace at the top of a 12-metre tall Chinese-made machine. Once molten, the aluminum is cast into the shapes of various car body panels and other components. More robot carts, and the occasional human driving a forklift, take the components to a warehouse. Loading Yet more robots take the panels to the assembly line, where hundreds of robotic arms, working in teams of up to 16, do a complex dance to weld them together into car bodies. The welding area is a so-called dark factory, meaning that the robots can operate without workers and with the lights off. China\u2019s factories still employ legions of workers. Even with the automation, they are needed to check quality and install some parts that require manual dexterity, such as wiring harnesses. There are things cameras and computers cannot do on their own. Before cars are painted, workers still run gloved hands over them and sand smooth any tiny imperfections.

The company plans to acquire a robotic arm that uses artificial intelligence to replicate the way a person welds the sides of an oven. Credit: Qilai Shen/The New York Times\n\nYet, some of the later steps of quality control are also being automated with the help of artificial intelligence. Loading Near the end of Zeekr\u2019s assembly line, a dozen high-resolution cameras take photos of each car. Computers compare the images to an extensive database of correctly assembled cars and alert factory staff if a discrepancy is found. The task takes seconds. \u201cMost of our colleagues\u2019 jobs involve sitting in front of a computer monitor,\u201d said Pinky Wu, a Zeekr worker. Zeekr and other Chinese automakers are also using artificial intelligence to design cars and their features more efficiently.\n\nCarrie Li, a designer who works at Zeekr\u2019s new office building in Shanghai, uses AI to analyse how different interior surfaces will intersect in a car. \u201cI have more spare time to open my mind and explore for myself which kinds of fashion trends to include in the cars\u2019 interior,\u201d Li said. Car factories in the United States also use automation, but much of the equipment comes from China. Most of the world\u2019s car assembly plants built in the past 20 years were in China, and an automation industry grew up around them. Chinese companies also bought overseas suppliers of advanced robotics, such as Kuka of Germany, and moved much of their operations to China. When Volkswagen opened an electric car factory a year ago in Hefei, it had one robot from Germany and 1074 robots made in Shanghai. China\u2019s rapid advance in factory robotics has been propelled from the top down. Beijing\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d initiative, which began a decade ago, set out 10 industries in which China sought to be globally competitive. Robotics was one of them.\n\nA white-glove inspection of a vehicle on the assembly line. There remain some tasks that computers and cameras can\u2019t do on their own. Credit: Qilai Shen/The New York Times To force the car industry to think about how to use humanoid robots with two arms and two legs, for example, government officials in Beijing told major automakers last year to rent robots and submit videos of them performing tasks in their assembly plants. The Zeekr plant\u2019s greeter robot, which is still in testing, has a humanoid hand. Credit: Qilai Shen/The New York Times The videos required many takes to get them right. The robots did only basic tasks, such as sorting auto parts in a warehouse. But the initiative has helped push the carmakers along. In a show of the automation push, the Beijing municipal government held a half-marathon on Saturday for 12,000 runners and 20 humanoid robots. Only six robots finished the race, and the fastest of them took nearly three times as long as the fastest runners. But the event helped draw attention to robots.\n\nLast month, Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s second-highest official, said in his annual report to the legislature that the country\u2019s plans this year would include an effort to \u201cvigorously develop\u201d intelligent robots. The country\u2019s top economic planning agency announced a $US137 billion national venture capital fund for robotics, artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies.

Credit: Qilai Shen/The New York Times China\u2019s government-controlled banks have increased lending to industrial borrowers over the past four years by a staggering $US1.9 trillion. That has paid for the construction of factories as well as the replacement of equipment at existing ones. China\u2019s universities produce about 350,000 mechanical engineering graduates per year, as well as electricians, welders and other trained technicians. By comparison, American universities graduate about 45,000 mechanical engineers each year.\n\nJonathan Hurst, chief robot officer and a co-founder of Agility Robotics, a leading American robot manufacturer, said finding skilled employees had been one of his biggest challenges. As a graduate student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Hurst said, he was one of two mechanical engineers. China\u2019s rapid embrace of automation worries some Chinese workers. Geng Yuanjie, 27, drives a forklift at the Zeekr factory, where he has worked for the past two years. He said there were considerably fewer robots at the Volkswagen factory where he previously worked. Surrounded by robots, he has few co-workers to talk to during his 12-hour shifts. To demonstrate advances in automation, Beijing held a half-marathon for 12,000 runners and 20 humanoid robots. Only six robots finished. Credit: Andrea Verdelli/The New York Times \u201cI can feel the trend towards automation,\u201d Geng said as he watched a robot cart pull a rack of car parts past his forklift. He said that his high school education might not be enough for him to qualify for classes in programming robots, and that he worried he might lose his job someday to a robot.\n\n\u201cIt is not just my concern \u2013 everyone worries about it,\u201d Geng said. Automation has threatened and even eliminated jobs around the world for more than a century, often slowing automation\u2019s growth. In China, there are fewer obstacles than practically anywhere else. China has no independent labor unions, and Communist Party control leaves almost no room for dissent. Another factor behind China\u2019s automation drive is the country\u2019s demographic crisis. The number of babies born each year has dropped by almost two-thirds since 1987. At the same time, two-thirds of people turning 18 now enroll at a university or college, an educational trajectory that has allowed a new generation to aspire to careers outside factory labor. \u201cChina\u2019s demographic dividend is over,\u201d said Stephen Dyer, head of the Asia industrial practice at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. \u201cThey\u2019re now in a demographic deficit, and the only way out of that is productivity.\u201d",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking on ABC Radio National, Opposition Immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said a Coalition government would cut skilled migration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we're going to do in the first instance is we're going to reduce the skilled migration level. We will take that down from 185,000 to 140,000. The program will continue at 150,000 in years two and three.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition is yet to release a target for skilled migration - so the figures from its Immigration Spokesperson were unexpected.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestioned on the wisdom of reducing skilled visas at a time of worker shortages, Mr Tehan told ABC's Radio National that some skills would in fact be prioritised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've said we want to prioritise those trade areas to complement out plumbers, our electricians, our builders, and we will focus on that. We've also said in those areas for instance in terms of hospitality where we need chefs and cooks we'll look at prioritising those areas. when it comes to aged care. What we'll do is we will change the settings that the Labor party have put in place, which is actually restricting people from being able to come in. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe skilled migration intake is currently limited to 132,000 places - that's 8000 places fewer than the target cited as Coalition policy by Mr Tehan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked by SBS if his party was in fact proposing to increase migration - Opposition Leader Peter Dutton replied that he hadn't seen the comments made by his Immigration Spokesperson - but confirmed his party would cut overall migration.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton: \"What we've said is that we are gonna cut migration by 25 per cent, because we are going to cut it by 25 per cent, because the government has created a housing crisis, bringing two million people in over two years, which is unprecedented, so we gonna fix that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReporter:\"So do you think he misspeaks?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton: \"We are gonna fix up Labor's mess, we've been clear about what we will be doing in Year 1 and 2, where we will reduce by 25 per cent in Year 3 and 4, we will bring it back up. We have to get Aussie kids to the houses.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition Leader has previously said he will cut net overseas migration by 100,000 places in order to free up more housing for young people in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nNet migration refers to the difference between the number of people arriving in Australia and those leaving.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo achieve the Coalition's migration targets, Mr Tehan confirmed a Dutton government would cut Australia\u2019s humanitarian intake by 20,000, to its long-term average of 13,750, and reduce foreign student commencements by at least 30,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nParent visas and partner visas would not change under a Coalition government.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils of Australia earlier this week released a statement criticising Coalition proposals to change the citizenship 'values' test and ban refugees from Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nChairperson Peter Doukas says he's also concerned migrants have become scapegoats for the cost of living and housing crises.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've seen a divergence, particularly from some political actors, of their traditional stance protecting the pluralistic nature of our multicultural society, and for that reason we have voiced our concerns that we want to keep racism, racial profiling, out of this campaign. All parties have concerning rhetoric regarding immigration in a way that is different from previous stances and the stances of previous Australian governments.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Khalil is recontesting the safe Labor seat of Wills in Melbourne's north in the May 3 election, and is also the government's special envoy for social cohesion.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the Labor Party is proud of its record in resettling Palestinian refugees from Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think Australia is only one of three countries that's provided thousands of visas for Palestinian refugees. We've resettled a number of refugees in my electorate. I've worked with Palestinian families, in fact helped some families to get out of Gaza and worked with the Foreign Ministry and so on to do that work and help resettle them. We don't make a big fuss about it, we don't make TikTok videos about it because this is about making sure we get outcomes.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "It's the party with the most election wins under its belt in Australian history and the party of Australia's two longest-serving prime ministers.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut where did the Liberal Party come from, and who are they now?\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's your guide to Australia's Liberal Party ahead of the 2025 election.\n\n\n\nA brief history of the Liberal Party\n\nFormed in 1944, the Liberal Party was born in response to the Labor Party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Jill Sheppard, senior lecturer at The Australian National University's School of Politics and International Relations, said there was a simple idea behind it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Liberal Party really just formed in response to the Labor Party, and that has shaped not only sort of their history, but it also shapes where they are at the moment,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nRobert Menzies, the founding member of the Liberal Party, was very strong on the idea of individual choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis assessment was that the Labor Party had been born out of the union movement and that no-one spoke for people who were self-employed and the middle class.\n\n\n\n\n\nA bunch of other people thought the same thing, so they banded together to form the Liberal Party, as former Liberal Party frontbencher George Brandis explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Liberal Party was conceived to represent the broad mainstream of Australia in those days, not organised labour, and it certainly wasn't designed to represent the big end of town either,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Major donors to political parties\n\nIn 1949, the Liberal Party won its first election, partnering up with the Country Party of Australia, making Robert Menzies prime minister.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He [Robert Menzies] was hugely successful at creating and sort of driving this sense of purpose that represented an Australian society that made sense to a lot of people, and he called these he's forgotten people,\" Brandis said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this reason, the Liberal Party focused on people who were middle-class, owned small businesses, and professionals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Menzies said the rich can look after themselves; the working man is often looked after by his trade union,\" Brandis said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But middle-class people, small business people, professional people, farmers, artisans, those sorts of people have no-one to look after them. So that was the original base of the Liberal Party.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMenzies was a strong advocate of the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act \u2014 more commonly known as the 'White Australia Policy'.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in 1966, the Liberal Party changed laws, paving the way to abolish the policy.\n\n\n\nWait, doesn't liberal mean left?\n\nThe Liberal Party is considered to be the more conservative of the two major parties, leaning right.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd since the party is more politically conservative than liberal, the name might seem a bit confusing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile in other parts of the world, parties that oppose labour are often called conservative, Brandis said that was not the original intent of the party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Of the various options that Menzies had in choosing the name of his new party, he avoided calling it the Conservative Party, because he wasn't a conservative, he was a classical liberal,\" he said.\n\n\n\nBut Sheppard said there is a conservative element.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are two core streams of the Liberal Party, and one is what we would call liberal, but we often call that small liberal. What we mean is there is a genuine belief that the government is not here to help you, that you are your best advocate, that you should you can best decide how to live your life, and the less the government does, the better,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The conservative stream of the Liberal Party does think that government is okay. They're much less resistant to the idea that government can solve our problems.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does the Liberal Party look like nowadays?\n\nNowadays, the Liberal Party traditionally seeks a \"smaller, quieter Australia\", Sheppard said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But what they are less happy about are things like same-sex marriage, open borders, you know, international students. They want a smaller, quieter Australia that looks more like it did in the 1960s,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's an incredibly different set of principles that the Liberal Party is trying to manage. Under Peter Dutton, the party feels quite conservative. It feels like a party that just wants us to live quietly, does not want to rock the boat too much.\"\n\n\n\nThe Liberal Party teams up with the Nationals in a coalition to form a government.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrandis describes it as a \"functional\" and \"necessary\" relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The National Party, though, is a very different beast from the Liberal Party,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhat have been the Liberal Party's biggest achievements?\n\nSheppard said the party would be proud of its economic achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Liberalisation of the economy, you know, the ability for anyone in the middle class or working class to move up in society, to own their own business, to go to university if they wish, to live the kind of life that they choose that isn't tied to their occupation or to what their parents did,\" she explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They would say that is their core achievement over the last 30 years.\"\n\n\n\nSome of the most well-known Liberal Party policies include:\n\n\n\nResettling Vietnamese refugees after the Vietnam War in 1976.\n\nEstablishing the Special Broadcasting Service in 1978.\n\nBringing in tougher gun laws after the Port Arthur massacre in 1996.\n\nAnd creating Operation Sovereign Borders in 2013.\n\nWhich leaders have been part of the Liberal Party?\n\nOne of the party's best-known leaders is Harold Holt, who famously went missing in the ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Howard, the second longest-serving prime minister of Australia, was also a member of the Liberal Party.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party was last in government in 2022 \u2014 and Scott Morrison was the last Liberal Party prime minister of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton is the current leader and will be the prime minister if the Coalition wins the next election.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's been a politician for 25 years, and before then was a police officer.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What to know about Peter Dutton, the leader of the opposition vying to be PM\n\nWhat's ahead for the Liberal Party in this upcoming election?\n\nFor this year's election, the Liberal Party's slogan is 'Get Australia Back on Track'.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir policies include:\n\n\n\nBuilding Australia's first nuclear reactors\n\nBeing tough on crime\n\nReducing wasteful spending, including cutting public service jobs\n\nReducing migration\n\nSo, how does the party stack up to its original manifesto? Pretty well, Sheppard said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Weirdly, I think the Liberal Party is probably closer to its original party than the Labor Party is.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "It's Australia's oldest political party and is currently in power in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut where did the Labor Party come from and what does it represent now?\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead, your guide to the party ahead of the 2025 election.\n\n\n\nAustralia's oldest political party\n\nThe Australian Labor Party \u2014 or ALP \u2014 is Australia's oldest political party.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ALP is synonymous with Australia's labour and union movement, being born from the \"great shearer strikes in western Queensland in the 1890s\", according to Wayne Swan, former treasurer and the party's current national president.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack then, working conditions were tough, so trade unions, which are organised groups of workers, were formed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey wanted their demands taken seriously by the government, so they formed the Labor Party in 1901.\n\n\n\nAt the start, Labor's policies were focused on workers' rights. It campaigned for the eight-hour working day and created the minimum working wage.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its early days, it was a strong advocate for the \u2018White Australia Policy\u2019 and was largely against immigration.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut these days, the party's priorities have shifted.\n\n\n\nWhat does the ALP look like now?\n\nLabor fills the space of the more progressive party out of the two main contenders, and is considered centre left.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior lecturer at the Australian National University's School of Politics and International Relations, Jill Sheppard, says the party is rooted in unions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes, when we think we'd expect Labor to be a bit more progressive on some issues, or maybe a bit more pro-immigration, we can sometimes explain that by drawing on their history of being really trade union representatives,\" she tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Labor Party says it also represents the working class and workers' rights in Australia, rooted in strong union ties.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The 124-year-old feature of Australian elections that Albanese supports changing\n\n\"We are a party that is proudly of the union movement and associated with the union, so the union movement is a participant in our party,\" Swan told SBS News. \"Not all union members are members of the Labor Party, but many are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ethos of unionism, the solidarity that comes from it, looking after your mate, if you like, always been having an eye out for those that are more vulnerable, and lending them a helping hand lies at the very core of unionism, but also at the very core ethos of the Labor Party.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt its core, the Labor Party believes the government has a role in \"spreading\" opportunity, according to Swan.\n\n\n\nHe says it's what you'd call a party of big government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We fundamentally believe that government has got a role to play in creating prosperity and then spreading the opportunity,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So we see a significant role for government intervention in the economy, in clear contrast to the number of conservative parties over the past 100 years that have argued for essentially a survival of the fittest mentality on their side of politics, small government, regressive tax, a very sparse social safety net.\"\n\n\n\nWhat have been the Labor Party's biggest achievements?\n\nSheppard says over the last 15 years, the party would be proud of its social achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We might look at things like the apology to the Stolen Generations, we might look at constant minimum wage increases, things that don't always sound very exciting, but they are the important business of governing the country, making sure that there is a safety net for the worst off Australians,\" she said.\n\n\n\nSome of its biggest achievements include:\n\n\n\nIntroducing universal healthcare in 1974 (first known as Medibank, now Medicare)\n\nThe Native Title Act of 1993\n\nSetting up the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the NDIS, in 2013\n\nWhich well-known leaders have been part of the ALP?\n\nTwo key Labor figures were Gough Whitlam, its longest-serving leader, and Bob Hawke, its longest-serving prime minister.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitlam led a reformist government that ended military conscription, established universal healthcare and introduced free university education, among other measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was controversially dismissed by then governor-general Sir John Kerr in 1975.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hawke government's measures included floating the dollar, deregulating the banking industry and confirming Australia's national colours as green and gold.\n\n\n\n\n\nHawke was also renowned for the speed at which he could skol a beer.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What to know about Anthony Albanese, prime minister and Labor leader\n\nKevin Rudd \u2014 who was pushed out by Australia's first and only female PM Julia Gillard \u2014 both belong to the ALP.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leader of the party, and Australia at the moment, is Anthony Albanese. If Labor wins the next election, he'll be prime minister again.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's been a federal politician for almost 30 years, elected to the inner west Sydney seat of Grayndler.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has spoken about how he grew up in public housing with a single mother.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen taking office, he said his government's areas of focus would be the cost of living, bolstering Indigenous rights, and tougher climate action.\n\n\n\nWhat's ahead for the Labor Party this upcoming election?\n\nAs we head into the election, Swan says it's not going to be easy for Labor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a myriad of challenges,\" Swan said. \"There's been no government in the last couple of years that's been re-elected internationally in this cost of living crisis, which is largely internationally induced. So it's a tough environment to go to the people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis election, Labor's policies include:\n\n\n\nCutting student debt\n\nMaking childcare cheaper\n\nImproving Medicare\n\nInvesting in renewable energy\n\nSo how does the party stack up to its original manifesto? Sheppard says there's been a lot of change.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Elon Li\u2019s curbside workshop in Guangzhou, the commercial hub of southeastern China, has 11 workers who cut and weld metal to make inexpensive ovens and barbecue equipment. He is preparing to pay $US40,000 ($63,000) to a Chinese company for a robotic arm with a camera. The device uses artificial intelligence to observe how a worker welds the sides of an oven, and then duplicates the action with minimal human intervention. Only four years ago, the same system was available only from foreign robot companies and cost nearly $US140,000. \u201cBefore, I never would have imagined investing in automation,\u201d Li said, adding that a human employee \u201ccan only work for eight hours a day, but a machine can work 24 hours.\u201d A robot sorts lug nuts before attaching wheels to electric cars at a Zeekr plant in Ningbo, China. Credit: Qilai Shen/The New York Times Bigger companies bet far more on automation. In Ningbo, a huge factory for Zeekr, a Chinese electric carmaker, had 500 robots when it opened four years ago. Now there are 820, and many more are planned.\n\nCheerfully trilling Kenny G tunes to warn any people of their approach, robot carts haul aluminum ingots to an automated elevator, which lifts the blocks of metal to a furnace at the top of a 12-metre tall Chinese-made machine. Once molten, the aluminum is cast into the shapes of various car body panels and other components. More robot carts, and the occasional human driving a forklift, take the components to a warehouse. Loading Yet more robots take the panels to the assembly line, where hundreds of robotic arms, working in teams of up to 16, do a complex dance to weld them together into car bodies. The welding area is a so-called dark factory, meaning that the robots can operate without workers and with the lights off. China\u2019s factories still employ legions of workers. Even with the automation, they are needed to check quality and install some parts that require manual dexterity, such as wiring harnesses. There are things cameras and computers cannot do on their own. Before cars are painted, workers still run gloved hands over them and sand smooth any tiny imperfections. A worker making ovens and cookware at a small factory in Guangzhou. The company plans to acquire a robotic arm that uses artificial intelligence to replicate the way a person welds the sides of an oven. Credit: Qilai Shen/The New York Times\n\nYet, some of the later steps of quality control are also being automated with the help of artificial intelligence. Loading Near the end of Zeekr\u2019s assembly line, a dozen high-resolution cameras take photos of each car. Computers compare the images to an extensive database of correctly assembled cars and alert factory staff if a discrepancy is found. The task takes seconds. \u201cMost of our colleagues\u2019 jobs involve sitting in front of a computer monitor,\u201d said Pinky Wu, a Zeekr worker. Zeekr and other Chinese automakers are also using artificial intelligence to design cars and their features more efficiently.\n\nCarrie Li, a designer who works at Zeekr\u2019s new office building in Shanghai, uses AI to analyse how different interior surfaces will intersect in a car. \u201cI have more spare time to open my mind and explore for myself which kinds of fashion trends to include in the cars\u2019 interior,\u201d Li said. Car factories in the United States also use automation, but much of the equipment comes from China. Most of the world\u2019s car assembly plants built in the past 20 years were in China, and an automation industry grew up around them. Chinese companies also bought overseas suppliers of advanced robotics, such as Kuka of Germany, and moved much of their operations to China. When Volkswagen opened an electric car factory a year ago in Hefei, it had one robot from Germany and 1074 robots made in Shanghai. China\u2019s rapid advance in factory robotics has been propelled from the top down. Beijing\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d initiative, which began a decade ago, set out 10 industries in which China sought to be globally competitive. Robotics was one of them.\n\nA white-glove inspection of a vehicle on the assembly line. There remain some tasks that computers and cameras can\u2019t do on their own. Credit: Qilai Shen/The New York Times To force the car industry to think about how to use humanoid robots with two arms and two legs, for example, government officials in Beijing told major automakers last year to rent robots and submit videos of them performing tasks in their assembly plants. The Zeekr plant\u2019s greeter robot, which is still in testing, has a humanoid hand. Credit: Qilai Shen/The New York Times The videos required many takes to get them right. The robots did only basic tasks, such as sorting auto parts in a warehouse. But the initiative has helped push the carmakers along. In a show of the automation push, the Beijing municipal government held a half-marathon on Saturday for 12,000 runners and 20 humanoid robots. Only six robots finished the race, and the fastest of them took nearly three times as long as the fastest runners. But the event helped draw attention to robots.\n\nLast month, Premier Li Qiang, China\u2019s second-highest official, said in his annual report to the legislature that the country\u2019s plans this year would include an effort to \u201cvigorously develop\u201d intelligent robots. The country\u2019s top economic planning agency announced a $US137 billion national venture capital fund for robotics, artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies.

That has paid for the construction of factories as well as the replacement of equipment at existing ones. China\u2019s universities produce about 350,000 mechanical engineering graduates per year, as well as electricians, welders and other trained technicians. By comparison, American universities graduate about 45,000 mechanical engineers each year.\n\nJonathan Hurst, chief robot officer and a co-founder of Agility Robotics, a leading American robot manufacturer, said finding skilled employees had been one of his biggest challenges. As a graduate student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Hurst said, he was one of two mechanical engineers. China\u2019s rapid embrace of automation worries some Chinese workers. Geng Yuanjie, 27, drives a forklift at the Zeekr factory, where he has worked for the past two years. He said there were considerably fewer robots at the Volkswagen factory where he previously worked. Surrounded by robots, he has few co-workers to talk to during his 12-hour shifts. To demonstrate advances in automation, Beijing held a half-marathon for 12,000 runners and 20 humanoid robots. Only six robots finished.

He said that his high school education might not be enough for him to qualify for classes in programming robots, and that he worried he might lose his job someday to a robot.\n\n\u201cIt is not just my concern \u2013 everyone worries about it,\u201d Geng said. Automation has threatened and even eliminated jobs around the world for more than a century, often slowing automation\u2019s growth. In China, there are fewer obstacles than practically anywhere else. China has no independent labor unions, and Communist Party control leaves almost no room for dissent. Another factor behind China\u2019s automation drive is the country\u2019s demographic crisis. The number of babies born each year has dropped by almost two-thirds since 1987. At the same time, two-thirds of people turning 18 now enroll at a university or college, an educational trajectory that has allowed a new generation to aspire to careers outside factory labor. \u201cChina\u2019s demographic dividend is over,\u201d said Stephen Dyer, head of the Asia industrial practice at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. \u201cThey\u2019re now in a demographic deficit, and the only way out of that is productivity.\u201d",

It was the man lying beneath it all.\n\nThousands of people wait before St Peter\u2019s Basilica to see the Pope lying in state on Thursday. Credit: Flavio Brancaleone\n\nPope Francis, in death, looked exactly as he had tried to live \u2013 unadorned. There was no papal crown, no golden thread. Just a red chasuble, his white cassock, and the gentle crossing of his hands on his chest. His face was slackened by time, but unmistakably him.\n\nThe man who spoke of climate change as a moral crisis. The man who washed the feet of prisoners. The man who dared, within the great machinery of the Catholic Church, to simply ask for kindness.",
