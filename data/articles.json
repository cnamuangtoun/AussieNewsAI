(ABC News: Kyle Harley)\n\nMelbourne-based plastic surgeon Ramin Shayan, who specialises in reconstructive treatments, wants to see more education for medical professionals.\n\nHe said dismissing patients' concerns could worsen their psychological distress.\n\n\"I think it's the psychological impact of telling people that you need to go away and lose weight when in fact\u2026 what we're talking about is not susceptible to normal weight loss measures,\" he said.\n\n\"There is the implication people are \u2026 being told that there's something wrong with them, that you're guilty of being lazy or gluttonous when actually it's a real pathological disease that's very harmful.\"\n\nKaren Kinnersley says her health started to decline before leaving the NT.

(Supplied: Shane Mikic)\n\nHe said being a good stringer relied on technical knowledge.\n\n\"It's about player preference, but it's also the type of ball they hit as well,\" he said.\n\n\"Generally players who hit with a lot of topspin can get away with having a looser string bed.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"Players who hit very flat, say someone like Bernard Tomic, generally has to string a little bit tighter to get the control that he needs.\"\n\nDr Krause said Tennis Australia was trying to challenge traditional stringing room environments in its bid to ramp up numbers of stringers.\n\n\"There's been an expectation for stringers to start an hour before play and end an hour after play,\" he said.\n\n\" Previously the stringers used to be accustomed to doing 20-hour days. \"\n\nHe said Tennis Australia were working to redefine those stereotypes, including roping-in stringers on a shift-based model and on shared machines.\n\n\"We're now looking into how do we increase the efficiency of the room, provide more opportunities, leverage the existing talent we've got out there now,\" he said.\n\nThe 2026 Australian Open begins in Melbourne on January 12.",

(Supplied: Peter Buchanan)\n\n\"There is the odd spinner, but nowadays boys and girls tend to rely on two or three of the skills.\n\n\"You don't see too many young cricketers that are just trying to learn how to bowl off spin and leg spin, they're generally batters who can bowl a bit.\n\nBuchanan said it was \"quite possible\" the lack of spin seen in the Ashes would accelerate that trend.\n\n\"I think there's still a place in the game for a spinner, but I just think at the moment with these drop-in pitches, they're tending to be more conducive to medium and fast bowling,\" he said.\n\n\"With the white ball format, a lot of these junior competitions, young cricketers are only allowed to bowl certain amount of overs and as a spin bowler you actually need to bowl lots of overs to \u2026 improve your craft and it takes a long time.\n\n\"So, I think it's an issue but hopefully it's not a dying art because we need to have spin bowling as an option in all games of cricket.\"",

So they'll end up seeking more facial procedures just to try to make it look balanced again,\" she said.\n\nThe \"Barbie nose\" procedure removes much of the structural integrity of the nose, increasing risks of breathing difficulties and even nasal collapse.\n\nIt can take \"significant revisional procedures\" to restructure the nose, including using rib cartilage.\n\nA before and after example of the \"Barbie nose\" rhinoplasty.

(Supplied: TikTok/thatsleah)\n\nFor Abbi, this feels like nothing new.\n\n\"I think the pressure to [not have] an 'ethnic' nose has always existed,\" she said.\n\n\"There's literally people who rub their baby's nose when they're really tiny [to] get rid of the bump.\"\n\nSocial media is playing a key role in reinforcing the trend. (Supplied: TikTok/jasminiaura/hope_schwing)\n\nProfessor Sharp said she had seen \"quite a bit of regret\" from some patients who changed their so-called \"ethnic\" features to keep up.\n\n\"They go, 'I don't look like anyone in my family anymore',\" she said.\n\n\"That's something people really need to consider before undergoing a rhinoplasty.\"\n\nDr Aquino emphasised that cosmetic surgery is not something to be ashamed of, adding that race isn't defined by a single facial feature.\n\n\"People should have the right to do whatever they want with their body. However, I believe people should do it in a safe way,\" he said.\n\nAbbi Dib urges people to do their research before they get a nose job. (Supplied: Abbi Dib)\n\n'People do it to turn into someone else'\n\nSeven years on from her nose job, Abbi says she doesn't regret a thing \u2014 however, she urges people to do their research.\n\n\"Some things are irreversible,\" she said.\n\n\"Allow a few years to think about it and try not to make the decision when you're 18 or 19.\"\n\nShe also encouraged anyone seeking a rhinoplasty to ensure it fits their face \u2014 rather than fitting a trend.\n\n\"People want to act like plastic surgery is to enhance your natural features,\" she said.",

        "text": "For the past 90 years, the City of Wollongong Brass and Wind Band has been proud of keeping its membership fees down, but the looming loss of funding has cast doubt on the band's future.\n\n\"We want to include everybody as much as possible,\" said the band's president Neil Wright.\n\n\"Some people might say it's kind of a niche \u2026 but there's a lot of people who do this.\"\n\nThe volunteer-run group is one of more than 100 community and school bands in New South Wales, which are represented by the Bands Association of NSW (BANSW).\n\nFor years the association has received funding through the state government's arts and culture grant schemes, and has allocated it to local bands to cover venue hire, advertising, organising concerts, buying sheet music or repairing instruments.\n\nBANSW president Jeff Markham said the amount they received often \"waxed and waned\", but they had consistently secured around $55,000 each year for the past decade.\n\nJeff Markham says consistent funding had been the key to the community band scene's longevity. (Supplied)\n\n\"We've had certainty of funding which has allowed us to plan,\" he said.\n\nIn Wollongong, Mr Wright said the money had helped fund music camps, workshops and social media advertising.\n\n\"Most of our grants have been towards fostering our young and upcoming players,\" he said.\n\n\"It's good getting particularly the young ones into the organisation, but you've got to find ways of wanting them to actually remain as part of the organisation.\"\n\nNeil Wright is the president of the City of Wollongong Brass and Wind Band. (Supplied)\n\nFight for funding\n\nMore than 140 organisations were successful in the latest round of funding, which for the first time operated under a competitive model.\n\nGroups had been able to apply for multi-year funding over for a period of two or four years.\n\nBut BANSW's funding application was rejected.\n\nA spokesperson for Create NSW said the latest funding rounds had been \"highly competitive\".\n\n\"The Arts and Cultural Funding Program is delivered through an open, competitive, independently assessed process,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\n\" Funding is not ongoing or guaranteed. \"\n\nCreate NSW said it held multiple meetings with BANSW to provide \"feedback and support\" before and after its application was submitted.\n\n'Significant' impact on bands\n\nMr Markham said the possibility of BANSW no longer being able to fund local bands for the time being would have a \"significant\" impact \u2014 especially on groups with younger players.\n\n\"The youth program is a lot of work, it's a lot of expense, and it's a lot of energy,\" he said.\n\nA spokesperson for Create NSW said funding is not ongoing or guaranteed. (Supplied)\n\nMr Wright said if they were granted money this year, they would have used it on promotional materials like banners and signs.\n\n\"Currently, we just do without, and hope people might come up close enough and ask questions,\" he said.\n\n\"They're just little things \u2026 [but] if we're able to get a grant, we don't have to think about where we are going to take that money from.\"\n\nHe said it might also affect their membership costs.\n\n\"Something we've been fairly proud of is keeping our membership fees down.\"\n\nBudget changes flagged\n\nMr Markham said without grant funding, bands could soon be forced to reassess whether some of their events and programs are worth budgeting for.\n\n\"Most of the stuff a band does in the community, they don't get paid for it,\" he said.\n\nMr Markham says band members may be asked to help cover activity costs. (Supplied)\n\n\"Without that little bit of funding, all of the money has to come from the band itself, which means there's no upfront commitment to do these things.\"\n\nMr Markham said the alternative was to ask members to reach into their own pockets to help meet band costs.\n\n\"They're all out fundraising, but all those fundraising efforts are all to just keep the doors open,\" he said.\n\n\"Everything else extra to that is basically on the members.\"\n\nRegional bands hit hard\n\nThe Hills Music Academy in Sydney's north-west has youth and senior bands with around 100 members.\n\nMusical director Garry Clark said the academy had been receiving grant funding periodically over the last 25 years.\n\nHe said their larger membership base and event partnerships meant they would not be as affected by the loss of funding as their regional counterparts.\n\nGarry Clark says small regional bands would be hit hard by the funding loss. (Supplied)\n\n\"Smaller groups, less active groups, they would really struggle,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of the regional groups would maybe not even be able to function, because numbers are not as high.\"\n\nMr Wright said that may be the case for his musicians.\n\n\"We'll [still] put on events, it just means however that we can't subsidise these events \u2026 there might be some players who might not be able to attend.\"\n\nBringing community together\n\nMr Clark says musicians provide an important service to their community. (Supplied)\n\nMr Clark said locals would ultimately suffer if their bands could not survive.\n\n\"Seeing a band out in public performing, marching down the street, playing Christmas carols in a shopping centre, all those little things that bring the community together.\"\n\nMr Markham said the importance of community bands is often underestimated.\n\n\"Your community band is quite often the first place that somebody will be introduced to live music,\" he said.\n\n\"We play in nursing homes, we play at funerals \u2026 and quite often for many people, the community band is the last live music that they see as well.\"",

The 50-year-old initially served in Melbourne, but in 2022 he was moved by his superiors to Bourke in north-western NSW.\n\nAfter joining the seminary in Indonesia at age 17, Oche Matutina was ordained at 29. (ABC Western Plains: Catherine James)\n\n\"It was hard for me to move from the city, especially since I heard some stories about Bourke,\" Fr Matutina said.\n\n\" But once I arrived here, everything changed. I love this place. \"\n\nHis provincial \u2014 a religious superior \u2014 had shared with him how difficult it was to find priests willing to relocate to the rural town some 800 kilometres from Sydney and based in one of the largest Catholic dioceses in Australia.\n\nThe Diocese of Wilcannia-Forbes covers more than half of New South Wales and its priests will drive hundreds of kilometres each week to reach the faithful in towns sparsely scattered across the outback plains.\n\nLast year, Fr Matutina asked his provincial to keep him in Bourke for three more years.\n\n\"He didn't say yes or no, but he was smiling. I think it was positive.\"\n\nOche Matutina came to Australia in 2020 to provide pastoral care. (ABC Western Plains: Catherine James)\n\nHeavy metal childhood\n\nGrowing up as one of seven children on Indonesia's Sumba island, music \u2014 specifically Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix and Metallica \u2014 dominated Fr Matutina's childhood, encouraged by a father who crafted guitars and ukuleles out of wood.\n\nThroughout school, he dreamed of the big stage and spotlights as he and his siblings entertained locally with their band.\n\nBut a German priest who loved to hum changed the game.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"He always walked around with his habit and humming,\" Fr Matutina said, recalling how happy he seemed.\n\n\"He started something in my heart to be a priest.\"\n\nA pivotal conversation between the pair where Fr Matutina shared his dilemma about whether to pursue the priesthood or music clinched the decision to do both.\n\nThe German priest told him he'd be even more effective as a priest through music.\n\n\"[He] said to me, you can be a priest and play music. You can do more through music.\"\n\nBourke's Yellowbelly band members practise their set ahead of a gig in southern Queensland. (ABC Western Plains: Catherine James)\n\nJoining the seminary at 17, he would initially dial back the heavy metal as some superiors found it unbecoming, but the classic rock continued, with the likes of Chuck Berry, country rock, and the blues.\n\n\"Music is a prayer for me because music gives me joy,\" he said.\n\n\" And I remember my teacher saying it a long time ago \u2014 when you sing, you pray two times. \"\n\nCulture shock\n\nFr Matutina has found his passion for music more invaluable since arriving in Australia and realising most people aren't too keen to talk religion.\n\n\"It's different in Indonesia \u2014 you can meet people and they will ask you to talk about faith,\" he said.\n\n\"In Australia \u2026 many people don't really like to hear about faith, about church.\n\n\"When I start to talk about faith, sometimes people just leave me.\"\n\nSo music serves as the common ground instead.\n\n\"Through music, I make a connection,\" he said.\n\n\"Then we have opportunity to start the conversation, to talk. We just talk. I don't say anything about coming to church, about faith.\"\n\nOche Matutina joins his Yellowbelly bandmates for a gig in Eulo, Queensland. (Supplied)\n\nDrawing the crowds\n\nThe novelty of the electric guitar and prayers like Our Father with a country rock twang has proven to be a hit at Sunday mass. Attendance has grown tenfold since 2022, Fr Matutina said, from three to five people to sometimes 30 to 50 people in the pews.\n\nBut with 20 per cent of Bourke's roughly 2,700 residents identifying as Catholic in the 2021 census, it's clear to Fr Matutina that most of the parish never set foot in the church.\n\nSo he took his music beyond its walls.\n\nHis jam sessions with a local guitarist and singer Stephen Wilson, 20, were soon joined by bassist Kobie Lollback, 21. Not long after, drummer Dwayne (Sol) Elwood-Hudson, 51, joined in.\n\nBy Easter 2025, the four had formed a covers band, Yellowbelly. Together they've travelled throughout north-western NSW and southern Queensland to play in pubs, community events and anywhere people gather.\n\nOche Matutina loves busting out moves \u2026 like playing his electric guitar behind his head. (ABC Western Plains: Catherine James)\n\nFr Matutina is the unlikely lead guitarist, wearing his priestly collar and pulling rock star moves like playing riffs with his guitar behind his head.\n\nFor the other band members, who are all Aboriginal, the fact he's a Catholic priest from Indonesia was unremarkable.\n\n\"He's just like us. The only difference is his job, you know,\" Kobie Lollback says.\n\n\"He's not pushing church values on us. He's pretty much just one of us, basically.\"\n\nMr Lollback says he gets asked more questions about the age difference between the band mates.\n\n\"They say, 'How do you guys play the same music when you're like 30 years apart?'\" he said.\n\n\"We just say we connect. It's very hard to explain, [but] if you play in a band, you know that you only connect with certain types of people.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nFather Rock'n'roll\n\nFr Matutina's reputation has spread throughout the vast Wilcannia-Forbes diocese with strangers waving hello to him on pastoral visits in towns hours of travel away from Bourke.\n\n\"People now know me wherever I go,\" he said.\n\n\"Before [I was] just going and there was no expression.\n\n\"But now \u2014 'Father!!'\" He waved his hand frantically in imitation.\n\nHe might even have some groupies.\n\n\"Sometimes girls in the car [drive by] shouting, 'Father! Father!'\"\n\nHe has viewed it all as serving his first mission to be a priest as a sort of conduit to God by spreading the kind of happiness he believes music can offer.\n\nPastoral care in Bourke is Oche Matutina's primary focus and he has asked to stay for another three years. (ABC Western Plains: Catherine James)\n\n\"Faith is not just about coming to church. It is not just about praying in the church \u2026 it is about being together with people, sharing happiness, joy with the people.\n\n\"Outside there's many doctrines, many definitions \u2026 but for me it's simply like that \u2014 connection with people. That's faith.\n\n\"I want to show people God's kindness, God's love through myself.\"",

Credit: Getty Images We park the Bradbury theory and move on to the next topic of conversation: how did he come to be an Australian? The story starts, he says, with his mother, Melanie, who was born in Canada but went to school and university in Sydney from the age of nine.\n\nLoading She moved to Australia with her parents in the late 1970s. Her father, Ronald Hawkes, helped discover a gold mine in Western Australia. Hawkes was a geologist and the general manager of Plutonic Gold. During the family\u2019s time in Sydney, his company opened a pit in Western Australia, about 300 kilometres north-east of Meekatharra. In 1988, Melanie returned to Canada to finish her economics degree and met and married Trevor Corey. They spent time in Halifax and Toronto before settling back in their home town of Fredericton, New Brunswick. Corey was born in 1997.\n\nBut, as Melanie later explains down the phone from Canada, she never lost her connection to Australia. \u201cFor me and my sister, it was our formative years,\u201d she says. \u201cSo much of my schooling was done there. I did the HSC [Higher School Certificate], and, you know, the extracurricular activities that you do \u2013 it\u2019s more part of you than you realise. \u201cMy sister had a fantastic Aussie accent. I think mine was always just kind of mixed \u2013 my husband teases me because whenever I go back, it\u2019s like a little light switch that comes back on.\u201d Corey was first introduced to ice hockey by his father, but by the age of eight had lost interest in the puck.\n\n\u201cI just want to skate fast,\u201d he told his parents. For the next 15 years, he pursued speed skating, rising through the ranks until he was in the top six in the country. He then hit a speed hump. \u201cIt became apparent that there were certain skaters that were being given preferential treatment,\u201d his mother explains. \u201cAnd I had always sort of said, \u2018You know if it doesn\u2019t work out for you here, you can probably look to Australia\u2019.\u201d Brendan Corey\u2019s skates during the quarter-finals at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Credit: AP The seed was further sown when Corey met former Australian speed skater Richard Nizielski at an international competition in Montreal in 2019. Corey explained that his mother had been a one-time resident Down Under.\n\nNizielski countered with an offer: \u201cIf you can ever come to Australia, we can always use a good skater.\u201d Then fate played a hand. Later that year, Corey missed selection for the Canadian team after being taken out by a teammate during a practice session and suffering concussion. Suddenly finding his career in limbo, he decided to move to Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve been living here on and off since 2019-2020,\u201d Corey says. \u201cI am usually here for two-to-three months of the year, and the other nine or 10, I\u2019m overseas training.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been training in Italy for the past two years with the Italian Olympic team in short track.\u201d While Corey has made Melbourne his new home, he says he is yet to find a favourite coffee shop or immerse himself fully in the city\u2019s way of life. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the occasional AFL game, but I\u2019m just enjoying the sights while I\u2019m here, exploring the city, going to the beaches sort of thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to explore the country as a whole.\u201d\n\nAs for his parents, Trevor and Melanie Corey immediately embraced their son\u2019s choice. \u201cI know other people, when Brendan went to Australia, kind of were considering it as well, but to them, it was like, \u2018Oh, Australia\u2019s so far\u2019,\u201d Melanie says. \u201cWhereas for me, there was just no hesitation because I was familiar. It was not like a \u2018here\u2019 and \u2018there\u2019 kind of thing. It made sense, like it wasn\u2019t foreign to me at all.\u201d Melanie says her two children, Brendan and his sister Brianna, grew up hearing her speak fondly of Australia. \u201cIt was just kind of natural for them,\u201d she says. \u201cI think some of the words that I would use were Australian slang, and they got used to hearing that.\n\n\u201cFor example, the word \u2018reckon\u2019 \u2013 a lot of Aussies use \u2018reckon\u2019, but people don\u2019t so much here. \u201cAnd I would tell him he was \u2018cheeky\u2019, and that was another word that was not used here. So it was in their everyday life in some way.\u201d Once it became apparent Corey would represent his new country at international level, he was made an Australian citizen.

Credit: Getty Images He skated for Australia in the men\u2019s 1000m short track skating at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, but crashed out in the quarter-finals.\n\n\u201cIn this sport, the top two move on to the next round, and I was sitting in third on the last lap, so I thought, \u2018I need to try something, I don\u2019t want to just sit here and finish third\u2019,\u201d he explains. \u201cI felt like I should try the pass, but I was a bit tight, and ended up being too tight.\u201d Which brings us back to Bradbury. Corey was only five when the peroxide-blond Australian won the unthinkable gold. But even in Canada he knew his story well. They have since met several times face to face. \u201cThat was an incredible moment in sports,\u201d Corey says. \u201cI don\u2019t think something like that will ever happen again.\u201d So the \u201cReverse Bradbury\u201d concept, winning from the front, is a possibility? \u201cI like to be a part of the race, be in the action,\u201d Corey concedes.",

        "text": "\u201cBig screens are no longer the exception; they\u2019re the expectation,\u201d Samsung Australia\u2019s Simon Howe said. Australia remains a top-10 market globally for premium televisions per capita \u2013 we love our screens even when budgets are tight. Hisense expanded its RGB MiniLED range with the UR Series, bringing premium display technology to accessible price points. The company\u2019s partnership with French audio specialists Devialet continues, and for gamers, 180Hz refresh rates promise competitive advantage. Your AI assistant can recommend what to watch next. It cannot explain why the world outside your living room grows more volatile. The new TVs will undoubtedly be popular locally but what stood out most wasn\u2019t the hardware. It\u2019s the insistence that artificial intelligence must be embedded in everything. Samsung, LG and Hisense each spruiked new AI features full of promise. Tony Brown, LG\u2019s television lead, made the pitch I heard all week: AI processes your content for optimal picture quality, scales up low-definition YouTube clips and navigates streaming abundance. Samsung\u2019s \u201cVisual AI Companion\u201d lets you query sports statistics mid-game.\n\nYet the relentless AI branding still sits somewhere between actual innovation and a marketing arms race. After the pandemic drove a wave of TV upgrades, many consumers will be ready to upgrade again this year, particularly ahead of the FIFA World Cup. Questions about picture quality, size and price will still probably be more important than whether your TV can tell you which actor you\u2019re looking at. Loading Lego\u2019s surprise The most novel announcement wasn\u2019t from a tech company at all. Lego unveiled Smart Play, which the company calls its biggest innovation in 50 years. Eight years in development, the system embeds sophisticated electronics into standard bricks. A chip smaller than a LEGO stud combines sensors, microphones and computing into a 2x4 footprint. These smart bricks form a \u201cdecentralised computing network\u201d \u2013 models built by different children can interact without prior connection.\n\nFuturist Sally Dominguez, observing from the show floor, noted that purely digital AI products gave visitors \u201ca really boring time walking around\u201d, but when digital technologies create hybrid physical experiences, products can really sing. Literally, in the case of Lego. The Lego demonstration drew audience excitement \u2013 and even some gasps \u2013 in ways that another slightly slimmer laptop simply couldn\u2019t. LEGO smart bricks are shown during a LEGO news conference ahead of the CES tech show. Credit: AP Julia Goldin, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer, framed it as consumer driven rather than technology driven. \u201cThis innovation came through understanding how kids play,\u201d she said in an interview. The platform extends physical play time, encourages storytelling and crucially doesn\u2019t require a screen or power button. Children can simply start playing. The first Star Wars sets will be launched in March. Futurist Mark Pesce noted his hope that the system allowed unstructured play rather than constraining imagination to pre-programmed interactions. We\u2019ll see.\n\nThe \u2018zero-labour\u2019 home The broader theme was domestic liberation through robotics. LG demonstrated CLOiD, an AI-powered home robot representing the company\u2019s vision of bringing intelligence from screens into the physical world. The timeline for Australian homes? \u201cA few years away\u201d, but the direction is clear. Samsung\u2019s AI smart kitchens and laundry appliances similarly point to a choreless future. An LG Electronics CLOiD home robot. Credit: Bloomberg More immediately, Ecovacs showcased robot vacuums with 30,000 pascals of suction and \u201cperpetual runtime\u201d batteries that fast-charge during cleaning pit stops. The company leads the Australian market and is integrating AI stain detection that identifies dried ketchup, sprays it, waits, then cleans. \u201cYou should be able to just decide that you want your floor cleaned, your windows cleaned, and let us take care of that,\u201d says Karen Powell, Ecovacs\u2019 Australian head.\n\nWhere was Australia? Dr Catherine Ball. Credit: Fairfax Walking the floor, you encounter national pavilions from South Korea, France and Israel. They are co-ordinated presences where startups cluster under a common flag, making it easier for buyers and investors to find them. Australia, conspicuously, had nothing. Dr Catherine Ball, a futurist who tracks the show, argues this represents a structural gap with very real costs. She says CES is one of the few places where buyers, investors, partners and media converge at scale \u2013 where a startup can move from \u201cnice demo\u201d to \u201clet\u2019s pilot this\u201d in a single week. Australian founders hustle alone, making our IP harder to discover, harder to trust and easier to overlook. She says that means fewer warm introductions, fewer conversations about distribution and less visibility in rooms where shortlists get written and awards doled out. A co-ordinated \u201cTeam Australia\u201d booth would create a single front door for startups, she says.\n\nIt\u2019s a reasonable question whether Australia\u2019s innovation ambitions are serious or merely rhetorical. We talk about becoming a technology exporter while leaving our entrepreneurs to navigate the world\u2019s largest innovation show without institutional support. AI-enabled toys and robots were everywhere at CES. Credit: AP The uncomfortable truth As is often the case for the tech sector, CES exists in a bubble. Its 140,000 attendees were sealed off from reality in windowless convention centres. The overarching theme of the show was about making life easier and better, through AI, smart robots and bigger and brighter television sets. Yet on the same day we watched demonstrations of robot companions designed to eliminate loneliness, an ICE agent shot a woman through her windshield, just a couple of days after US forces captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a military operation and flew him to New York.",

What experts are seeing, however, is that it easily transmits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It appears that it's probably going to have an ability to at least be slightly less sensitive to antibody or vaccine-mediated protection,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeakin University epidemiology professor Catherine Bennett told SBS News: \"This new subvariant of the H3N2 is that bit more immune evasive with these latest mutations in the part of the virus that allows it to invade our cells, making us more susceptible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBennett said the 2025 flu vaccine included H3N2, but not this specific class.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Influenza cases surge: time to get vaccinated say experts SBS News 06:40 English\n\n\"Flu vaccines wane in effectiveness, so people vaccinated back in April-May and only getting infected now won't have the same benefit,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the 2026 flu vaccine for the southern hemisphere has already been updated to include this variant, and will likely be available around April, Bennett said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEsterman said the flu vaccine remains worthwhile and provides important protection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It still significantly reduces the risk of severe disease.\"\n\n\n\nWhat does a typical flu season look like in Australia?\n\n\"When we get seasonal influenza every year in Australia, or anywhere, it's a combination of three viruses,\" said Reading.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two influenza A viruses \u2014 a H3N2 and H1N1 \u2014 and one influenza B virus.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian Centre for Disease Control, there were 365,261 reports of the flu in 2024. Cases spiked between May and August, and drastically dropped following the winter.\n\n\n\n\"As we move into spring, flu generally comes down in Australia, and then it's very low during summer,\" said Reading.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year there were 502,493 reports of influenza, with cases clearly continuing until the end of the year following those winter months.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to GISAID, H3N2 subclade-K is driving an estimated 90 per cent of cases in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we saw around September [in Australia] onwards is the H1N1s and B viruses decreased, but we saw an increase in H3N2 viruses,\" Reading said.\n\n\n\nHow can I avoid catching the flu?\n\n\"People who are unwell should consider testing and should avoid mixing with other people as much as possible,\" Bennett said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Is it COVID or the flu?

In some parts of Sydney \u2014 particularly the western suburbs, where temperatures during heatwaves can be several degrees higher than in the east \u2014 the forecast for Saturday is even warmer.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe impacts of heat inequality are exacerbated during a heatwave. So why do some suburbs experience that heat more acutely, and can anything be done about it?\n\n\n\nWhy is it hotter in some suburbs than others?\n\nWhile western Sydney is frequently cited as an example of geographical heat inequality, similar dynamics can be observed in other parts of the country, such as Melbourne and Adelaide, with inland suburbs experiencing heatwaves more intensely than their coastal counterparts.\n\n\n\nRiccardo Paolini is an associate professor at UNSW's School of Built Environment. He said a combination of factors leads to some parts of a city being more vulnerable to heat than others.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Sydney's case, he said the primary factor driving higher temperatures in the west compared to the coast during heatwaves was advection, hot air flowing from inland areas, blocking cooling sea breezes from reaching western suburbs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"During a heat wave, this hot front penetrates farther and farther, up to the inner west, and therefore you have a greater prevalence of the heat wave over the western suburbs,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is compounded by the 'urban heat island' effect, in which urban areas are significantly warmer than rural areas due to the high density of hard surfaces, like buildings and roads that retain more heat than greener spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese include pavements made of asphalt and concrete and dark roofing on houses and other buildings, combined with insufficient vegetation, green space and shade, particularly around homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These very, very dark surfaces heat the air like the bottom of a pot heats the water when you're cooking pasta,\" Paolini said.\n\n\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThis increased vulnerability can have varied and significant effects on the individual and broader society, and can overlap with populations that experience socio-economic disadvantage, such as western Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nOllie Jay is a professor of heat and health at the University of Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told SBS News that while there are areas that get hotter temperatures, often amplified by the built environment, it's also important to consider populations with higher vulnerability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So you've got people there that are more vulnerable to that level of heat stress,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People who are older, people who have a chronic disease, often people who don't have access to air conditioning, or all three of those things put together.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Nearly seven million Australians at risk from urban fires, new report warns SBS News 04:39 English\n\nAccording to advocacy group Sweltering Cities, renters and low-income households are more likely to live in homes that don't provide good natural insulation or cooling, nor have access to cooling options such as air conditioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of people who are most vulnerable to the heat actually don't have access to air conditioning,\" Jay said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaolini said there was a correlation between high outdoor temperatures and physical activity, and that at a certain threshold, people simply stay at home or other indoor spaces that are cool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's the effects of spending more money for electricity, bills for those who have air conditioning,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's the sleep divide between coastal areas and inland areas, where people living in western suburbs have poorer sleep quality because of extreme heat during this period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's getting worse over time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the ways heat inequality is most acutely felt is when it comes to health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we just think about the hospital cases [during a heatwave], both mortality and morbidity, then what we really see is that all of those numbers are massively amplified in people who are elderly \u2026 and people who have chronic diseases such as heart disease, kidney disease,\" Jay said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The reality virtually no Aussie can escape when a heatwave hits\n\nJay pointed out that beyond heat-related deaths, there were many other negative impacts below the surface when it came to negative health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You've got these other things that are happening inside the body when you get hot. It's not just your high body temperature. It's the fact that your heart has to work a lot harder to keep cool when you're exposed to the heat,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you've got heart disease, that makes you much more susceptible to a heart attack. If you've got kidney disease, you're at much greater risk of kidney failure if you have dehydration. It's really quite complex and deep, broad impacts on human health and wellbeing across the lifespan.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs it stands, urban heat equality is set to intensify as the effects of climate change become more severe \u2014 with ocean temperatures continually rising and even less cooling sea breezes.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaolini said Australian heatwaves are starting to more closely resemble those in Europe, which have excess heat-related mortality during extended heatwaves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So they don't have [temperatures of] 48C, as in Penrith, but they have eight days in a row when the night temperature doesn't drop below 28C or 30C, or even 32C in some cities. If you don't have air conditioning, this means that you cannot sleep, and then people who already have pre-existing medical conditions are exposed,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's looking to a not-so-nice future for us, because urbanisation is increasing, density is increasing. With poor planning, that's where we are headed.\"\n\n\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nIn Sydney\u2019s west, there's been a growing push to plant more trees and increase tree canopy coverage to combat the urban heat island effect and reduce the impact of heatwaves.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaolini said that while councils have focused on increasing the targets for tree canopy coverage, \"in reality it's decreasing, because a lot of new developments, these urban sprawl developments, they chop off every tree and then they put out a few broomsticks without any room for the roots to grow\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"After 10 years, the tree is still a broomstick,\" Paolini said. \"This means that the tree is not casting shadow over the street, and this means that the asphalt is absorbing a lot of solar radiation that then is dissipated by convection, so warming up there ... People want bigger houses, and this is eating up the space for the tree roots. That's a reality.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore broadly, Paolini pointed to projects like the Greater Sydney Heat Smart City Plan \u2014 led by council and contributed to by several research groups \u2014 aiming to mitigate extreme heat impacts across the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, he said a lot of governance structures are fragmented, despite the problem being regional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So even if you put all your best landscaping and all the best urban planning in one council area, it will improve the situation, but it's like operating the air conditioning with the windows open.\"\n\n\n\nPaolini said positive steps included a decrease in dark roofing as, since 2022, the National Construction Code included provisions for a minimum level of solar reflectance for new houses built. There's also a maximum solar absorptance \u2014 the amount of solar heat a roof takes in \u2014 of 64 per cent for new housing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a good start. The problem is, what do we do with what has already been built over the previous 50 years?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJay said it was vital that steps be taken to mitigate the \"steady march\" of climate change, such as decarbonising the economy and committing to the end of mass fossil fuel use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's warming that's baked into the climate system that we're going to feel the effects for the next 30 years, at least, even if we were to stop using fossil fuels today,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So we've got to think about how we adapt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe can think about the way that buildings are built, making sure there's better glazing, there's fans installed, that you haven't got direct sunlight coming in. Better exterior blinds, better insulation in walls and roofs. These are the types of adaptations that reduce the amount of heat that gets into the indoor environment from the hot weather outside.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

Got it Share\n\nI\u2019m writing this as the CEO of the Climate Council, and also as a mum of two young children. Every time the temperature is forecast to soar into the high 30s and even 40s, the same question hits: how do I keep my kids safe? Not just comfortable. Safe. What\u2019s often missed in the national conversation is that extreme heat is already one of Australia\u2019s deadliest hazards. Between 2001-18, nearly 500 heat-related deaths were reported to coroners in Australia. More recently, a study estimated 1009 Australians died due to heatwaves between 2016 and 2019, with Queensland and NSW recording the highest death tolls. The devastating fires in Victoria on the weekend. The Age In recent days, fires have left scenes of devastation across Victoria, with the loss of homes mounting. Meanwhile, large swaths of the country have experienced severe to extreme heat, from Western Australia across South Australia, NSW and Tasmania. Daytime temperatures pushed into the mid to high 40s, with overnight minimums in the mid-20s, offering little relief after dark. Some communities recorded temperatures at least 8C to 16C above average. When nights stay hot, bodies can\u2019t recover, and that\u2019s when the health impacts become most serious. Extreme heat isn\u2019t just \u201ca hot day\u201d. It isn\u2019t the summer weather Australians grew up expecting. It is a dangerous, escalating threat, supercharged by the continued burning of fossil fuels. Extreme heat also hits the hip pocket. Families pay through higher power bills and rising insurance premiums.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe good news is that Australia is already changing how we power our lives. Renewables are rising, batteries are scaling up and households are electrifying, but we have to move faster and stop making the problem worse. Related Article Analysis\n\nExtreme weather The official temperature was 42 degrees \u2013 but western Sydney felt as hot as 55 degrees Heat doesn\u2019t always leave a dramatic scar on the landscape. It doesn\u2019t always make the nightly news in the same way a cyclone or a catastrophic bushfire does. But it is relentless. It overwhelms the body, especially for babies and young children, older Australians, outdoor workers, people with disability, and anyone without access to cool, safe housing. It can also put healthy people at risk, particularly anyone working or exercising outdoors. Heat is also brutally unfair. If you live in a well-insulated home with efficient cooling, you can shut the door on the worst of it. If you are in a poorly built rental or a heat-trapping home, you can\u2019t. And here\u2019s the truth we have to confront: heatwaves are already more frequent, more intense and longer-lasting. Coal, oil and fossil gas are heating the planet, and we are living with the consequences. Next week\u2019s Copernicus annual climate update is likely to reinforce what the last decade has made clear: the world is heating fast, and every fraction of a degree now makes extreme heat more dangerous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen extreme heat hits, it doesn\u2019t just harm health, it disrupts childhood. School becomes unsafe. Outdoor play becomes impossible. Sleep becomes fractured. Tempers fray. Learning drops. Related Article Updated\n\nBushfires Fires to burn for weeks after razing area twice the size of London Parents for Climate has documented a growing number of school closure days caused by extreme weather, including repeated closures in north Queensland due to extreme heat. They also warn the official lists only tell part of the story. And many schools, frankly, are not equipped. Whether a child can learn safely on a scorching day can come down to whether their classroom has air conditioning, shade, access to water and back-up power. In 2026 Australia, that should not be a lottery. Summers are getting more extreme, but the solutions are clear and they are already under way. We need to accelerate them. First, stop expanding fossil fuels and rapidly cut climate pollution by accelerating clean energy, electrification and efficiency. Second, make our communities safer through better heat planning, cooler homes, shaded streets, resilient schools, accessible public cooling spaces and stronger emergency preparedness. That means practical, achievable changes. Better building standards so homes are fit for a hotter Australia. Minimum energy performance standards so renters are not left to swelter. Strong workplace protections when heat becomes dangerous. And an energy system built for reliability in extremes, powered by renewables and storage, not old coal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Bushfires Revealed: Why NSW faces extreme bushfire danger with fewer firefighters It also means being honest about who is paying. It is not fair that families are carrying the costs while fossil fuel companies keep pushing for more coal and gas. We know how to cut climate pollution and keep the lights on. We just need to move faster. As a mum, I want my kids to grow up in an Australia where summer still means fun, not fear. But we won\u2019t get there by treating this as \u201cjust another heatwave\u201d. This is climate change, in our streets and schools, in our homes. Extreme heat is already deadly. Fossil fuels are making it worse. And we can change course \u2013 if we choose to. Amanda McKenzie is CEO of the Climate Council.",

Steve Bradbury celebrates Australia\u2019s first-ever Winter Olympics gold medal at Salt Lake in 2002. Credit: Getty Images We park the Bradbury theory and move on to the next topic of conversation: how did he come to be an Australian? The story starts, he says, with his mother, Melanie, who was born in Canada but went to school and university in Sydney from the age of nine.\n\nLoading She moved to Australia with her parents in the late 1970s. Her father, Ronald Hawkes, helped discover a gold mine in Western Australia. Hawkes was a geologist and the general manager of Plutonic Gold. During the family\u2019s time in Sydney, his company opened a pit in Western Australia, about 300 kilometres north-east of Meekatharra. In 1988, Melanie returned to Canada to finish her economics degree and met and married Trevor Corey. They spent time in Halifax and Toronto before settling back in their home town of Fredericton, New Brunswick. Corey was born in 1997.\n\nBut, as Melanie later explains down the phone from Canada, she never lost her connection to Australia. \u201cFor me and my sister, it was our formative years,\u201d she says. \u201cSo much of my schooling was done there. I did the HSC [Higher School Certificate], and, you know, the extracurricular activities that you do \u2013 it\u2019s more part of you than you realise. \u201cMy sister had a fantastic Aussie accent. I think mine was always just kind of mixed \u2013 my husband teases me because whenever I go back, it\u2019s like a little light switch that comes back on.\u201d Corey was first introduced to ice hockey by his father, but by the age of eight had lost interest in the puck.\n\n\u201cI just want to skate fast,\u201d he told his parents. For the next 15 years, he pursued speed skating, rising through the ranks until he was in the top six in the country. He then hit a speed hump. \u201cIt became apparent that there were certain skaters that were being given preferential treatment,\u201d his mother explains. \u201cAnd I had always sort of said, \u2018You know if it doesn\u2019t work out for you here, you can probably look to Australia\u2019.\u201d Brendan Corey\u2019s skates during the quarter-finals at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Credit: AP The seed was further sown when Corey met former Australian speed skater Richard Nizielski at an international competition in Montreal in 2019. Corey explained that his mother had been a one-time resident Down Under.\n\nNizielski countered with an offer: \u201cIf you can ever come to Australia, we can always use a good skater.\u201d Then fate played a hand. Later that year, Corey missed selection for the Canadian team after being taken out by a teammate during a practice session and suffering concussion. Suddenly finding his career in limbo, he decided to move to Australia. \u201cI\u2019ve been living here on and off since 2019-2020,\u201d Corey says. \u201cI am usually here for two-to-three months of the year, and the other nine or 10, I\u2019m overseas training.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been training in Italy for the past two years with the Italian Olympic team in short track.\u201d While Corey has made Melbourne his new home, he says he is yet to find a favourite coffee shop or immerse himself fully in the city\u2019s way of life. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the occasional AFL game, but I\u2019m just enjoying the sights while I\u2019m here, exploring the city, going to the beaches sort of thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to explore the country as a whole.\u201d\n\nAs for his parents, Trevor and Melanie Corey immediately embraced their son\u2019s choice. \u201cI know other people, when Brendan went to Australia, kind of were considering it as well, but to them, it was like, \u2018Oh, Australia\u2019s so far\u2019,\u201d Melanie says. \u201cWhereas for me, there was just no hesitation because I was familiar. It was not like a \u2018here\u2019 and \u2018there\u2019 kind of thing. It made sense, like it wasn\u2019t foreign to me at all.\u201d Melanie says her two children, Brendan and his sister Brianna, grew up hearing her speak fondly of Australia. \u201cIt was just kind of natural for them,\u201d she says. \u201cI think some of the words that I would use were Australian slang, and they got used to hearing that.\n\n\u201cFor example, the word \u2018reckon\u2019 \u2013 a lot of Aussies use \u2018reckon\u2019, but people don\u2019t so much here. \u201cAnd I would tell him he was \u2018cheeky\u2019, and that was another word that was not used here. So it was in their everyday life in some way.\u201d Once it became apparent Corey would represent his new country at international level, he was made an Australian citizen. Brendan Corey crashes during the men\u2019s 1000m quarter-finals in the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games.

Corey was only five when the peroxide-blond Australian won the unthinkable gold. But even in Canada he knew his story well. They have since met several times face to face. \u201cThat was an incredible moment in sports,\u201d Corey says. \u201cI don\u2019t think something like that will ever happen again.\u201d So the \u201cReverse Bradbury\u201d concept, winning from the front, is a possibility? \u201cI like to be a part of the race, be in the action,\u201d Corey concedes.",

Some will find an isolated tropical island where English is not the first language, some will shed the whites of Test cricket and begin preparations for the smash and bash of the upcoming T20 World Cup.\n\nThe dogs bark and the caravan moves on. Most of England\u2019s batters will have little problem adapting to the game\u2019s shortest form. But their Test team will be in flux from now until forever if they continue to pursue an inflexible philosophy. It has not worked against a team that met force with cleverness in conditions they understand.\n\nThe tourists have not faced meaningful consequences for their failures, and they will continue to underachieve until they do. The nice thing for us is that we don\u2019t give a tinker\u2019s sledge about what England do. There are, however, some issues to be sorted with the home team.",
