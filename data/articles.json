        "text": "The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) has revealed there is $19 billion in lost and unclaimed super in Australia.\n\nData released today confirmed over seven million Australians are impacted, and they are now being urged to double-check their accounts.\n\nThe ATO said the average amount of unclaimed super per Australian stands at $2590, but said this could grow to tens of thousands of dollars by the time affected Aussies reach retirement age.\n\nOver seven billion Aussies have unclaimed super. (Fairfax)\n\nATO Deputy Commissioner Ben Kelly said many Aussies aren't even aware they have missing super.\n\n\"Checking for lost or unclaimed super is like reaching into your pocket and finding a $50 note, it's your money, you just didn't know it was there,\" he said.\n\n\"Your super can become lost if your account is inactive, and your fund can't contact you. If you've changed jobs, moved house or simply forgotten to update your details, you may have lost or unclaimed super.\"\n\nAssistant Treasurer Daniel Mulino said there were many reasons why Aussies could lose track of their super or fail to claim it.\n\n\"It could be that you've changed your name, that you changed jobs, or even that you've worked overseas,\" he told media this morning.\n\n\"What this can mean is that people can find themselves paying multiple fees, which will obviously have a bad effect on people's end balances.\"\n\nDaniel Mulino is urging Aussies to check if they are keeping track of their super. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nHowever, the ATO was quick to point out the solution is simpler than some may realise.\n\n\"This super is not lost forever. The ATO wants to get this lost and unclaimed money back into your account,\" Kelly said.\n\n\"While we're working hard to ensure people get full access to the super they have worked for, it is important for people to keep their information up to date in myGov.\n\n\"Your super follows you through your career, so you should keep a check on your account.\"",

I'm not going to make any political decisions. I'm purely football. Sam is an important part of what we're trying to do.\n\n\"As far as we're concerned, we just kept the status quo.

If Australia is watching football, it's pretty clear what she brings. And the real football fans would be able to see that.

Who will partner Usman Khawaja has been one of the most interesting decisions for the Australian selectors.\n\nKonstas is the incumbent opener with Khawaja, playing all three Test matches in Australia's tour of the West Indies in July.\n\nThe NSW batter made his Test debut in Melbourne last summer, scoring a breathtaking 60 in his first innings.\n\nIn his next nine innings in Test cricket, Konstas has only amassed another 103 runs.\n\nRenshaw and Labuschagne have made promising starts to the Australian domestic season.\n\nBatting at three in the Queensland order, Labuschagne is the leading run scorer across the opening two rounds with 337 runs.\n\nRenshaw opened the batting for Queensland with Khawaja in its second round match against Tasmania, scoring 128.\n\nTasmania's Jake Weatherald has also made his case for selection with a strong start to the season, but was dismissed for a duck late on Tuesday against Victoria.",

        "text": "Inflation has surged in the September quarter with consumer prices rising at an annual pace of 3.2 per cent, up from 2.1 per cent in the June quarter.\n\nThat level of inflation came in much hotter than economists were expecting, squashing hopes of a rate cut next week.\n\n\"With inflation vastly overshooting the RBA's forecasts the bank won't cut interest rates at its November meeting, and the chances that it won't loosen policy any further are rising,\" said Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia Pacific at Capital Economics.\n\nHeadline inflation rose by 1.3 per cent in the quarter, which was the highest quarterly rise since March 2023.\n\nMichelle Marquardt, ABS head of prices statistics, said the largest contributor to the quarterly movement in prices was electricity costs, which rose by 9 per cent.\n\nAnnual electricity price reviews came into effect from July 2025 and increased electricity across all capital cities.\n\nFinancial risks 'rising' warns RBA The Reserve Bank warns risks to the global financial system are \"rising\", not receding, and Australia is not immune from any fallout.\n\nThe \"trimmed mean\" measure of inflation, which is the Reserve Bank's preferred measure of underlying inflation, also rose in September, from 2.7 per cent to 3 per cent.\n\nThe RBA had forecast that headline inflation would rise quite sharply at this point in the cycle, with various government electricity rebates wearing off.\n\nBut it was not forecasting underlying inflation to rise from 2.7 to 3 per cent. It was forecasting underlying inflation to be 2.6 per cent by the end of December.\n\nBen Udy, lead economist for Oxford Economics Australia, said the sharp rise in inflation had delivered \"the knockout blow\" to any remaining hope of a November rate cut.\n\nHowever, he said he did not think it was anything to panic about.\n\nHe said inflationary pressures would still subside over the next 12 months and the RBA would likely still cut rates next year.\n\n\"The strength in today's inflation data is largely temporary,\" Mr Udy said.\n\n\"As the impact of the unwind in electricity rebates fades, wage growth continues to cool, and global trade disruption increases the flow of cheaper imports into Australia, we expect inflation to ease meaningfully over the year ahead.\n\n\"At the same time we expect the deterioration in the labour market to persist, forcing the bank to cut rates toward neutral.\n\n\"We've pencilled in two rate cuts in the first half of 2026.\"",

The topic changed to Julius Caesar in 2025.\n\nMr Langbroek confirmed the error did not occur for any other subject because there were no other changes to the syllabus in other subjects.\n\nHe said there would be an investigation into the resources and planning by the QCAA \"to make sure that we don't see a repeat of these situations\".\n\nThe QCAA said all of the schools impacted would submit a \"misadventure\" application so that special consideration could be taken into account.\n\nMother says daughter's hard work 'thrown out the window'\n\nA parent of a Redcliffe State High School student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the ABC that her daughter found out about 1pm on Tuesday she had been learning all of the wrong content, prompting her to make \"a frantic phone call\" to her mother.\n\n\"I spent a considerable amount of time talking to her, trying to calm her down yesterday,\" she said on Wednesday morning.\n\nAt least eight Queensland state high schools taught wrong topic for year 12 exam The state's education minister has ordered an investigation into the blunder, which was initially believed to affect one school, before that number grew.\n\nThe mother said her daughter panicked because she had been told she needed to work hard for a good ATAR to be accepted into university.\n\n\"All of that hard work could have been thrown out of the window for something [the students] had no control over,\" she said.\n\n\"It was about trying to get her into the right headspace, especially because she has another exam this morning.\"\n\nThe mother told the ABC the school had been communicative with parents and students about the error and sent students \"hundreds\" of pages of content about Julius Caesar on Tuesday in an effort to help prepare for the exam.\n\n\"She has another exam this morning, but spent all of last night trying to cram hundreds of pages of content that they were sent yesterday about Julius Caesar, the mother said.\n\n\"They received effectively four months' worth of content and were expected to do the best they can within 24 hours.\"\n\nShe said the biggest concern was the knock-on effects it would have for the students who had another exam this morning, but had spent their time and energy focusing on their ancient history exam instead.\n\n\"I am annoyed \u2026 these kids started high school through COVID, so to finish off with something big like this is sad for them,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not a smooth finish to a pretty unsettled high schooling.

(ABC Sunshine Coast: Jay Carstens)\n\n\"I put everything I had into this place and to be told that now I can't even sell it or even hand it on to my children \u2026 if I decide to venture on and do something else [I can't],\" Mr Philpot said.\n\n\"If I'd been told straight away that, 'You're not going to be able to sell', I wouldn't have bought it.\n\n\"I've invested all [my] money.\"\n\nThe 59-year-old is recovering from surgery and worries he could become a financial burden on his children.\n\n\"Now I can't even contribute to them, to help them along and to pretty much look after me,\" he said.\n\n'Poor decision-making' from past councils\n\nSunshine Coast Council said the move brought Dicky Beach in line with the rest of the region's publicly owned holiday parks.\n\nPermission to on-sell at other parks was removed two decades ago.\n\nBut some within the council fear it will only deepen the region's housing crisis.\n\nMayor Rosanna Natoli and Caloundra division councillor Terry Landsberg were among those who argued against the changes at a council meeting on October 16.\n\nTerry Landsberg says the permanent homes benefit the fabric of the local community. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Jay Carstens)\n\nCouncil officers said the move was required to bring the park in line with the Land Act of 1994.\n\nThe motion was passed six votes to four.\n\nCouncillor Taylor Bunnag supported the changes and said Dicky Beach's historical exemption should never have happened.\n\n\"We've also got 39 permanent dwellings in all our other holiday parks across the Sunshine Coast and [they] \u2026 have been restricted from on-selling their caravans in those locations,\" Cr Bunnag said.\n\n\"Dicky Beach has been an outlier for 20 years, which \u2026 is an unfair and unequal approach.\n\n\"[It's the result of] very poor decision-making by previous councils.\"\n\nHowever, Cr Landsberg said the park provided much-needed affordable housing.\n\n\"These people are not just retirees \u2014 they are key critical workers of our economy, they're carers [and] grandparents looking after their [grand] kids so that their parents can continue to work full time,\" he said.\n\nInvestments 'now worthless'\n\nPensioner Howard Hill, 80, purchased a non-fixed home in the park 30 years ago after a cancer diagnosis limited his ability to work.\n\n\"I spent $110,000 on my house four years ago to rebuild it \u2026 now it's worthless,\" Mr Hill said.\n\nHoward Hill has lived in the Dicky Beach park for three decades. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Jay Carstens)\n\n\"[Council] are not kicking people out, but it's the idea that you won't be able to resell if you were to move \u2026 you will have no way to recoup the costs of buying the house.\"\n\nCr Landsberg said the council had approved changes to dwellings for decades.\n\n\"[Past guidelines allowed for] the ability for park residents to gain building approvals certification, which was all ticked off by the council,\" Cr Landsberg said.\n\nQUT property law professor Sharon Christensen said the tenancy agreements for the land underneath the non-fixed homes would have set the rules for modification.\n\n\"[That agreement] will regulate, consistent with the Residential Tenancies Act, how long you can stay, what you can do on the site, whether you can attach fixtures,\" Professor Christensen said.\n\nShe said that despite permanent residency being listed as an inconsistent use of land set aside for camping, historical arrangements in place before those laws were introduced could continue to exist.\n\nHoward Hill and his wife Shirley are among those facing a financial loss. (ABC Sunshine Coast: Jay Carstens)\n\nAdding to housing pressures\n\nResidents of the park must relocate or demolish their homes when they decide to leave and will not receive compensation from the council, despite some dwellings being sold for upwards of $150,000 in recent years.\n\nMr Philpot said the council's actions did not match its rhetoric about addressing the housing crisis.\n\n\"They talk about affordable housing and trying to place people in affordable housing. We have affordable housing, we have our infrastructure set up and they're pretty much saying to us that they're not worth anything,\" he said.\n\n\"It's just ludicrous.\"\n\nCr Bunnag rejected the claim and said the council had been working on building new homes.\n\n\"We've delivered 22 affordable dwellings in partnership with the state government in Marcoola, but there's more to do \u2014 I absolutely recognise that,\" he said.",

        "text": "Thousands of early births have been avoided with improved outcomes for women and babies, according to analysis of a world-first Australian initiative.\n\nA study recently published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology, & Women's Health, examined the impact of a national preterm birth prevention program introduced in Australia in 2018.\n\nIt found since the prevention measures were introduced, the rate of preterm and early term births \u2014 a major cause of death and disability \u2014 had lowered by between 7 and 10 per cent, or about 4,000 fewer early births a year.\n\nUniversity of Western Australia Professor of Obstetrics and Chair of the Australian Preterm Birth Prevention Alliance, John Newnham, spearheaded the preterm birth prevention program and was lead author of the study, which examined nearly two million Australian births.\n\nProfessor John Newnham was lead author of the study. (ABC News: Jack Stevenson)\n\nHe said the lessons learned would significantly change the lives of many Australian families.\n\n\"No-one in the world has ever been able to lower their rate of pre-term birth across the nation, and Australia's rate, like all similar countries, has been rising dramatically in recent years,\" Professor Newnham said.\n\n\"We set out to form a national program to lower Australia's rate of pre-term birth, funded by the federal government, but with support all the way down through to individual hospitals, and we were successful.\"\n\nPreterm birth \u2014 which is defined as birth between 20 and 37 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 is the leading cause of death and one of the major causes of disability in children across the world. Early term birth is defined as between 37 and 39 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nAva only weighed 580 grams when she was born. (Supplied)\n\nProfessor Newnham said while 37 weeks used to be considered full-term, there was evidence to suggest planned births between 37 and 39 weeks \u2014 without medical justification \u2014 put babies at additional risk of having issues like having respiratory problems or needing neonatal care.\n\nThe six-year program was run in two three-year phases.\n\nThe first phase saw the rate of preterm births fall by 8 per cent, the equivalent of 1,342 cases each year.\n\nWhile the second phase looked at the rate of early term births, showing a reduction of 10 per cent over a 16-month period, which equated to about 5,300 fewer cases.\n\nThe initiative involved implementing seven clinical strategies, including avoiding births being planned before 39 weeks without medical justification.\n\nAva spent 101 days in the neonatal intensive care unit after being born at 25 weeks. (Supplied: Yasmine Phillips)\n\n\"There are medical reasons such as high blood pressure, but in the absence of those reasons, babies should be left where they belong until at least 39 weeks,\" Professor Newnham said.\n\nThe clinical strategies also include measuring the length of the cervix during pregnancy scans and using vaginal progesterone \u2014 which can help prevent the uterine contractions that can lead to early birth \u2014 for women with a short cervix or a history of preterm birth.\n\nHealth professionals were also encouraged to help women who smoke to quit and provide expectant parents with access to continuity of care \u2014 where they see the same health professional during their pregnancy.\n\n\"Australia for many years has been a very safe place for women to have babies. This program has made it even safer,\" he said.\n\nBaby born 'the size of a tub of butter'\n\nFor Perth mother Yasmine Phillips, the research has been \"truly life saving\".\n\nHer eldest daughter Ava, now five, was born via an emergency caesarean at 25 weeks after Ms Phillips developed a severe form of life-threatening pre-eclampsia.\n\n\"I was quite unwell and the future was really unknown for Ava at that point as well,\" Ms Phillips said.\n\nMs Phillip's experience with Ava (pictured) helped guide doctors to reduce her chance of another premature birth. (Supplied)\n\n\"[Ava] only weighed 580 grams when she was born, which is basically the size of a tub of butter that you might have in your fridge at home.\"\n\nAva spent 101 days in the neonatal intensive care unit. While her lungs will never be as strong as a child born at full term, she is now a \"happy and healthy\" little girl, Ms Phillips said.\n\nWhen Ms Phillips and her husband Chris Robinson decided to try for a second baby, Australian research into preventing preterm births gave doctors clear guidance on how to reduce the chance of another premature birth.\n\n\"We managed to make it safely to 37 weeks \u2026 that was all thanks to the knowledge that has come out of this world-first initiative,\" Ms Phillips said.\n\nSisters Ava (left) and baby Sage. (Supplied: Yasmine Phillips)\n\nShe believed the research was a game changer for her second daughter Sage.\n\n\"It's genuinely life saving work and we are so lucky to have these teams of people working together not only on the research side but with hospitals all over Australia to ensure that the life saving work that they are coming up with is being enacted in real life.\"\n\nDoctors are now implementing the strategies\n\nRoyal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists president Nisha Khot said doctors were already implementing the strategies.\n\n\"Looking at the length of the cervix every time you do a morphology scan at 20 to 22 weeks is something that has now pretty much become routine across the country,\" Dr Khot said.\n\n\"Doctors will definitely take a lot out of this \u2026 and already I see doctors have changed practice.\n\nNisha Knot says doctors are already implementing the strategies. (Supplied)\n\n\"I think the other really important thing that obstetricians have taken from this is that we must not plan to deliver babies before 39 weeks if there isn't a good reason to do it.\"\n\nDr Khot said while she was \"very excited\" about the study's success, more work was needed to prevent births of babies prior to 32 weeks gestation.\n\n\"We know that babies that are born at less than 32 weeks are more likely to have \u2026 physical disability, learning difficulties, other issues throughout their lifetime.\"\n\nProfessor Newnham said he would keep working to continue to reduce harmful early births, saying he first started the work as an obstetrician in Perth in the 1980s.\n\n\"This has been my career-long project and I started it and I still run it, but I'm surrounded by wonderful people all over the country who really have put their shoulder to the wheel to make it work,\" he said.",

If the September quarter \u201cproves to be the trough and October to-date trends continue, the stock should do well.\u201d Pressure is rising on the Woolworths CEO, who will face shareholders at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on Thursday, just as arch rival Coles will report its quarterly sales. Coles has been gaining market share on Woolworths. Coles shares dropped 0.6 per cent. Oil and gas giants Woodside and Santos fell for a second session as oil declined further amid mounting signs of oversupply, which quelled a bumper rally triggered by US sanctions on key Russian producers last week. West Texas Intermediate fell 1.9 per cent to again settle close to $US60 a barrel, the steepest daily drop in more than two weeks. Woodside was down 1.2 per cent and Santos shed 0.8 per cent in early trade. CSL also continued its slide, losing a further 5 per cent. The nation\u2019s biggest health company slumped 15.9 per cent on Tuesday after vaccine scepticism led to a plunge in influenza vaccinations in the US, a key market, forcing it to issue a profit warning for its Seqirus vaccine business and delaying the unit\u2019s planned spin-off into a separate company. Building products maker James Hardie shed 1 per cent after US homebuilder D.R. Horton reported weaker profit for the Northern hemisphere summer than expected amid cautious consumer sentiment. James Hardie makes about three quarters of its sales in the US.\n\nMining heavyweights BHP and Rio Tinto advanced, up 0.7 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively, while gold miners got some reprieve after their recent losses. Northern Star climbed 2.7 per cent, Evolution Mining added 2.9 per cent and Newmont was up 1.8 per cent as gold steadied after a three-day rout to trade near $US3950 an ounce. On Wall Street overnight, the S&P 500 added 0.2 per cent. The Dow Jones rose 0.3 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.8 per cent. All three indexes set all-time highs for a third straight day. Loading Moves were also relatively modest in the bond market as investors waits for a few events that could shake things up. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest move on interest rates, while some of the US bourse\u2019s most influential companies will report how much profit they made during the summer. On Thursday, President Donald Trump will meet China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping in hopes of smoothing tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Tech giants Apple (up 0.1 per cent) and Microsoft (up 2 per cent) both climbed, with both companies hitting a valuation of $US4 trillion during the session, joining AI giant Nvidia as the only publicly traded companies worth that figure. Microsoft hit the mark earlier in the year.\n\n\u201cWe expect another strong round of megacap tech earnings reports, given the relentless demand for AI technology and infrastructure,\u201d said Clark Bellin at Bellwether Wealth. \u201cWhile profitability in AI remains an unknown, investors for now are willing to overlook this as the AI arms race heats up.\u201d Amazon, meanwhile, rose 1 per cent after saying it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, or about 4 per cent of its corporate workforce, as it ramps up spending on artificial intelligence while cutting costs elsewhere. Until then, profit reports from overnight and the morning were the main drivers of Tuesday\u2019s action. United Parcel Service rallied 8 per cent after delivering stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. UPS also gave a forecast for revenue in the all-important holiday shipping season that was slightly above analysts\u2019 expectations. PayPal climbed 3.9 per cent after saying it made a bigger profit during the summer than analysts expected. It also said it plans to pay its shareholders a dividend every three months, while announcing a deal where internet users will be able to pay for purchases through OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nOn the losing end of Wall Street was Royal Caribbean, which lost 8.5 per cent despite reporting a stronger profit than analysts expected. Its revenue for the latest quarter fell short of expectations. The cruise operator also said it\u2019s seen a \u201cminimal\u201d hit to its business this quarter because of bad weather, along with the temporary closure of one of its exclusive destinations in Haiti. Loading A slowing job market is one of the main reasons Wall Street expects the Fed to announce another cut to interest rates on Wednesday. It would be the second time this year that it\u2019s lowered the federal funds rate in hopes of helping the job market. The widespread expectation is that the Fed will also cut rates for a third time at its final meeting of the year. A lot is riding on that, in part because US stock prices have already rallied to records on expectations for it. That means the most important part of Wednesday\u2019s announcement for Wall Street will be whether Fed Chair Jerome Powell gives any hints about upcoming moves. Fed officials have indicated that they\u2019re likely to keep cutting interest rates next year, but they may have to change course if inflation accelerates beyond its still-high level. That\u2019s because low interest rates can make inflation worse.",

        "text": "As a genre, memoirs can sometimes be lugubrious and self-indulgent, with the reader forced to listen to long stretches of dramatic peaks and scabrous lows, but Brown\u2019s storytelling is brisk and playful, and it\u2019s a pleasure to be in his company.\n\nBoth photos display Brown as a serious fellow, but such gravitas is undermined by the actual contents of this memoir: despite some of the heavier material, (substance abuse, bad health, familial woes and a nervous breakdown, aka \u201cexistentialitis\u201d), a rich vein of humour courses through the book. The tone of Confessions of a Minor Poet is conversational banter, an extended yarn to a mate over a pint or three.\n\nThe cover photo of Confessions of a Minor Poet features Phil Brown: floofy white-haired, black-rimmed glasses, with his hands on his face staring directly and unsmilingly at us. The one on the back is a portrait of him as a young man, tapping away on his trusty typewriter with a reference book nearby. He looks for all the world like a prim, industrious journo focused on breaking a story, or maybe he is in the midst of translating poetic snippets from handwriting to print.\n\nThe author\u2019s previous books have ranged in scope from poetry, travel writing, and even an ambitious search for the meaning of life. In 2019, he wrote a memoir about his childhood in Hong Kong during the 1960s. This latest offering is a sequel of sorts, picking up a decade later upon his return to Australia.\n\nJournalist, jobbing writer and poet Phil Brown in 2004.\n\nIt starts with 18-year-old \u201cBrowneye\u201d (an unfortunate travesty of his name bestowed by fellow surfers), at home in the Gold Coast. Picture this dope-smoking, ratbag teenager who had to repeat year 10 twice because of classroom misdemeanours and a surfing obsession. And yet, the lad was also a bookish maladroit whose companions included Ernest Hemingway, D. H. Lawrence and Patrick White. Oh, and inspired by unrequited love and the lyrics of The Beatles and The Doors, Brown also wrote his first poem \u2013 printed on the back of his surfboard.\n\nFrom this juvenilia period of experimentation (in drugs, booze and verse), the book tracks Brown\u2019s life as he serendipitously falls into journalism almost as an afterthought \u2013 when what he really wanted was to develop his poetic sensibility. His getting of literary wisdom was aided not only by emulating the style of his heroes, but by friendships with esteemed men of letters like \u201cThe Bard of Bunyah\u201d, Les Murray, and \u201cthe Poet of Ordinary Australia\u201d, Bruce Dawe. (It was fitting that Brown, the erstwhile disciple would, decades later, pen Dawe\u2019s obituary in The Courier-Mail.)\n\nThe title of this memoir could easily be thus: Confessions of a Knockabout Journalist and a Minor Poet, Brown\u2019s peripatetic lifestyle in his 20s and beyond led him to work for numerous media outlets: apart from a stint as a radio copywriter, he reported for various publications and across different editorial capacities in and beyond his home state. There are amusing tales of his time in rural newspapers (think bull sales, CWA jubilees, dairy festivals) and plenty of celebrity name-dropping when he was a social gadfly-about-town, with encounters with luminaries including Split Enz, Australian Crawl, Manning Clark, Eric Bana, Alain de Botton and Barry Humphries.",

The trend is also apparent in Australia: recent data shows that one in three Australian children aren\u2019t proficient readers, and that 29 per cent of teens don\u2019t choose to read at all.\n\nWe can all point to reasons: the rival attractions of the internet and social media, limitations to literacy, peer group pressure, and so on. It\u2019s a given that children develop an attachment to books at a very early age, long before they can read, through picture books and the voice of a parent or caregiver reading aloud. But parents these days are often too time-poor and tired to pick out the right books and to give their children this kind of attention.\n\nAuthors worry about the implications - both legal and ethical - of AI-generated books for children.

        "text": "Nationals leader David Littleproud has called for a review of the Bureau of Meteorology's (BoM) new website as the storm over its $4 million redesign continues to intensify.\n\n\n\n\n\nLittleproud said in a statement on Wednesday his office had received many complaints from locals in his regional Queensland electorate of Marnoa, who he said had complained the new website was difficult to navigate and lacked key tools, including the ability to enter GPS coordinates for specific property locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a result, families, business and farmers are unable to access vital localised data such as river heights and rainfall information,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he had asked Environment Minister Murray Watt \"to review the functionality of the updated BoM website and consider restoring key tools relied upon by farmers and rural communities\".\n\n\n\n\n\nLater on Wednesday morning, Watt accused the suggested BoM's management needed to improve and accused them of running a business model of \"fail and simply ask for more money\", and of poor forecasting that had, at times, caused confusion among farmers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They can't even manage to put a simple website together,\" Littleproud told reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's time that Minister Watt simply send them on their way to fix this and to get their house in order, because they are having a significant impact on Australian agriculture,\" he added.\n\n\n\nThe $4.1 million revamped BoM website was launched last week and quickly came under fire after savage storms left a trail of destruction across the eastern seaboard.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers complained the new website \u2014 the BoM's first in 12 years \u2014 did not indicate storm severity after wild weather wreaked havoc across Queensland and Victoria at the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Cornelius, managing director at forecasting company Weatherwatch, wrote on LinkedIn there were three major issues users were finding: the new radar underestimated the intensity of the storms, the new radar was lagging, and the new design made it difficult to find information when it was needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It beggars belief that the BoM would roll out such a significant change to an essential infrastructure service just as the main storm season is about to start,\" Cornelius wrote on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with Littleproud, Queensland treasurer David Janetzki has also written to Watt, demanding changes to the website as the clean-up from the storms continues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The decision to make the site live on 22 October, just as Queensland and Australia enter storm season, can, at its best, be described as short-sighted,\" he wrote in his letter to Watt.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe environment minister said on Tuesday that he called a meeting with BoM's acting CEO, Peter Stone, to discuss the public's concerns about the updated website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's clear that the new BoM website is not meeting many users' expectations, with a significant range of feedback provided to the bureau in recent days,\" Watt said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the meeting, I made clear my expectations that the BoM needed to consider this feedback and, where appropriate, adjust the website\u2019s settings as soon as possible. This includes urgent consideration of improvements to the website\u2019s functionality and useability.\"\n\n\n\nA BoM spokesperson defended the website's rollout on Wednesday, but acknowledged there had been challenges with the change.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson told the Australian Associated Press forecasts and warnings were not affected during the 22 October rollout and remained available throughout the day during the storms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(We) assure the community that the new site has been designed with public safety at its core ,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe radar functionality is one of the tools that prompted feedback from users, the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is just the beginning of our journey to improve our online services,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will continue to deliver website improvements based on feedback which we are taking seriously, just as we have done throughout the development phase.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

So they are in charge now, I'm not predicting anything. I hope we will win, it looks good, but you never know. So we never cheer before the end of Wednesday any election day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile his party may win the most seats, a functioning coalition needs to be built, meaning a more centrist government appears likely.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new prime minister could be conservative Henri Bontenbal, who has pledged to restore decency to Dutch politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201dWhat we have seen is two years of (the) politics of division and chaos. What we want do want to present is a politics of hope and responsibility.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrans Timmermans is another contender.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former European commissioner leads the recently merged Social Democrats and Greens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is ... get this country working again and put this country on a social track, on a track of fairer distribution, on a track where we reinstate the state that we needed on education, on health care, on housing, on social benefits.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe progressive D66 could also play a role in the next government.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts leader Rob Jetten\u2019s slogan is \u2018yes we can\u2019 with a campaign focused on building 10 new cities.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet it\u2019s Geert Wilders who has largely set the election agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinking the cost-of-living crisis to migration, he\u2019s proposed a total ban on asylum seekers.\n\n\n\n\n\nJaap Schilder is planning to vote for him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWith the asylum crisis, so to speak, these people all need to eat, they need to live. But we need to be able to take care of ourselves, and that's why I'm voting for the PVV. Our own people first.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent months, violent protests have occurred outside new migrant processing centre, while in August, Wilders posted an illustration on social media showing a woman\u2019s face - half blonde, half brown and wearing a headscarf, with the caption: \u2018the choice is yours\u2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt prompted a record number of complaints to the Dutch anti-discrimination hotline.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalwasha Hamzad is running for the Greens.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer family fled Afghanistan when she was a child and settled in Haarlem, near Amsterdam.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s concerned about where her adopted homeland is headed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI see increasing racism and discrimination and there can be various reasons for this. Poverty could be a reason. The housing crisis could also be a reason that these problems are used by certain political parties wanting division to arise in our society and set people against each other.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it appears it has worked.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite asylum seekers representing a small portion of total migrants, and migration being down year on year, a record number of people are expected to back far-right parties, including voter Gina Swarthoed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"(I am worried) about the integration of many foreigners.

        "text": "Australia's real spending on health has increased slightly after a one-year plateau, while cancer remains the disease Australia spends the most on, newly released data shows.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country's total health spend sat at $270.5 billion in 2023-24, according to Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) reports released on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn nominal terms, it's an increase from $244.9 billion in 2021-22 and $255.1 billion in 2022-23, but when adjusted for inflation, the figure was $267.7 billion in both those periods.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 69 per cent of this was paid for by the government \u2014 $106.2 billion coming from Canberra and $82 billion from state and territory governments.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a share of total government expenses, health spending decreased from 17.1 per cent in 2022-23 to 16.8 per cent in 2023-24, which \"suggests health spending grew more slowly than other areas of government expenditure\", the report reads.\n\n\n\nIn 2023\u201324, total health spending entered a post-pandemic period, totalling $270.5 billion, which equates to 10.1 per cent of the gross domestic product. Source: SBS News The AIHW also breaks down health expenditure into 17 disease and injury categories, and spending within these categories increased from $170.2 billion in 2022\u201323 to $180.4 billion in 2023\u201324.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe discrepancy between this figure and the nation's total health expenditure is due to $73.9 billion in costs such as administration and public health programs that can't be attributed to the treatment of any particular disease.\n\n\n\nWhich diseases do we spend the most on?\n\nCancer has remained the disease Australia spends the most on, a position it's held since 2017-2018. Spending on cancer has more than doubled since 2013-14 and now sits at $19.7 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong specific types of cancer, Australia spent the most on lung cancer and non-melanoma skin cancer ($1.87 billion each), bowel cancer ($1.85 billion) and breast cancer ($1.84 billion).\n\n\n\n\n\nCancer also had the highest burden, accounting for 16.4 per cent of the overall reduction in the total of disability adjusted life years caused by the 17 disease and injury categories.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisability-adjusted life years, also known as health loss, is a metric calculated from the years of life people lose due to premature death or disability caused by illness or injury.\n\n\n\nIn 2023\u201324, cancer was the disease group with the highest spending ($19.7 billion), followed by cardiovascular diseases ($16.9 billion) and musculoskeletal disorders ($16.3 billion). Source: SBS News In second and third place are cardiovascular diseases at $16.9 billion and musculoskeletal disorders at $16.3 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronary heart disease ($3.8 billion), atrial fibrillation and flutter ($2.1 billion) and stroke ($2 billion) had the highest spending levels among cardiovascular diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong musculoskeletal disorders, osteoarthritis ($4.8 billion) and back pain and problems ($4 billion) attracted the most expenditure.\n\n\n\n\n\nCancer, cardiovascular diseases and musculoskeletal disorders have been the top three spending groups in all but one year since 2013-14.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO INTERVIEW: Australia among first countries to launch lung cancer screening program SBS News 12:37 English\n\nBeyond that, the next most costly disease categories were well care ($13.9 billion) \u2014 encompassing things like routine dental work and pregnancy/postpartum care \u2014 infectious diseases ($13.3 billion), and gastrointestinal disorders ($13.1 billion).\n\n\n\n\n\nMental health conditions and substance use disorders ranked seventh in terms of overall spending, at $12.4 billion, but had the second-highest health loss, accounting for 14.8 per cent of the reduction in disability adjusted life years.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon mental health conditions like depression and anxiety accounted for the most spending in this category \u2014 $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively \u2014 but per case, schizophrenia was the most expensive at roughly $29,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AIHW report notes there can be many reasons why certain disease categories have steeply divergent costs and spending levels.\n\n\n\nCancer was the disease group with the highest disease burden in Australia in 2024, accounting for 16.4 per cent of total disability-adjusted life years. Source: SBS News \"In cases where a particular disease has relatively high human cost but low spending, it does not necessarily mean that health spending should be increased,\" the authors write.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Road transport injuries or smoking-related diseases, for example, may be also addressed by investments and responses outside the health system, such as through education, transport, environmental health or other social services.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe estimates in the recently released report are compiled from more than 50 data sources and capture spending by governments, individuals, private health insurers and other private sources.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey only include spending within the healthcare sector, but the AIHW notes that the costs of disease extend far beyond this into people's lives.\n\n\n\nWhat's killing us?\n\nThe most recently updated AIHW data, covering 2023, shows Australia's leading underlying causes of death vary by sex.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoronary heart disease was the biggest underlying killer of men, accounting for 10.8 per cent of deaths, while dementia was fatal to most women, accounting for around 12.2 per cent of deaths in that year.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Dead before 50: The Australians dying young at the edge of the system\n\nIn second place for both sexes, these underlying causes switch positions, accounting for between 6.4 per cent of male deaths and 7.6 per cent of female deaths.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn third place for men is lung cancer at 5.4 per cent, while for women it is cerebrovascular disease at 6.1 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading causes of death also varied by age, with land transport accidents the most common cause of death among children aged 1\u201314 and chronic diseases the leading cause among people aged 45 and over.\n\n\n\n",

For him, the treatment process has been overwhelming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A very debilitating, a very overwhelming feeling of being sick and not being able to do anything. The doctors told me I'd maybe end up being on dialysis, which is a sort of scary proposition.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, Mr Brown has been relying on medication to improve his condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's pleased to learn his upcoming medication bill can be cheaper, as the federal government announces that it will include a drug for kidney disease into the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nJardiance is a medication that can slow kidney damage over time and help preserve kidney function for longer.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a concession card holder, it means Mr Brown will only need to pay $7.70 per script to access Jardiance from now on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's gonna make a big difference, and the fact that $7.70 is a big difference when you work it out over 12 months.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor eligible patients without a concession card, the script will only cost $31.60.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd from January 1 next year, the price will be further lowered to $25.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Health Minister Mark Butler says Jardiance is a life-changing drug for many Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Last year, we listed Jardiance for a limited group of Australians with a particular type of kidney disease. But from Saturday, we think another 70,000 Australians with kidney disease will become eligible for this life-changing drug.\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to 2021 census, around 1 per cent of Australian population are living with kidney disease, with one in twenty Australians aged 75 and above being diagnosed with the disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Butler describes kidney disease as a silent epidemic in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We think more than two and a half million Australians have kidney disease, but less than 10 per cent of them know about it, because the sign and symptoms of kidney disease usually only become apparent when it's as much as 90 per cent of loss of kidney function has already taken place.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Carol Pollock, who is the chair of Kidney Health Australia, also stresses the importance of conducting health checks to detect the asymptomatic disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To pick up kidney disease, what we really need is a blood test, a blood pressure check and a urine test. And some people will have some of these tests done, but not always together, and we really need the three of them to be done. And what we would like to see is a kidney health check that meant that people would have those things done and then have an understanding of what the risk the kidney disease could be and allow it to be appropriately treated.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

And this is going to be something different, will be astronomical. This will be hard to digest when this is over.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMany have chosen to ride out the storm, prompting Jamaica's Prime Minister Andrew Holness to issue mandatory evacuation orders for several south coast communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have always had a very slow, if not non-response to the call for evacuation ... And that is why we emphasise preparation, because preparation lessens the damage.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a school-turned evacuation centre in Montego Bay, shelter manager Sandra Simon Clarke is preparing for impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have seen and heard that it's going to be very catastrophic.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act is facing its first major reform in twenty-six years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe long-awaited overhaul of Australia\u2019s national environmental law will take centre stage in Parliament this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the second iteration of the package, following the 2020 review authored by Graham Samuel.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Minister Murray Watt's predecessor, Tanya Plibersek, was previously accused of breaking a 2022 election promise after she pushed back tabling the initial reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey parts of these reforms include setting up an independent Environmental Protection Agency, though the Minister still gets the final say, and there's a major push for state agreements to speed up approvals.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Opposition Leader Sussan Ley and Shadow Environment Minister Angie Bell formally asked Labor to split the bill.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Bell told the ABC yesterday that doing so would immediately fast-track pro-business initiatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWell, we want to see some movement on this bill, and we don't want to stand in the way of environmental reform, and so we've suggested to the government overnight how to improve their bills. So we want to see the bill split, so we can streamline approvals and we can improve environmental protections separately. And what we've seen from the government is a flat refusal immediately...\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Bell was correct on the flat refusal...\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Watt was quick to label the split 'the maddest idea', rejecting the demands, which he argues would lead to more habitat destruction, more species threatened, no independent regulator and slower approval times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need to have a clear definition of the types of projects that would simply be unacceptable to the impact they would have on the environment - of course that would be beneficial for the environment in stopping unacceptable developments going ahead but it\u2019s also really important for business to have the kind of clear definition so they get a fast no on a project and know that a particular project isn\u2019t going to get approved.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Ley's pitch also seems to be out of step with the Business Council of Australia (BCA), which said one big bill would offer more certainty to businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite these concerns however, BCA CEO Bran Black indicated the council would prefer Labor to negotiate a deal with the opposition rather than the Greens,\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there are a range of concerns with Labor's proposed reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThose concerns relate to matters like the definition of unacceptable impacts and net gain the powers of the CEO of the EPA with respect to stop work orders, the circumstances in which disclosures with respect to emissions are relevant to assessments and of course, the fundamental point for us is how we can go about ensuring that at the end of the day, there is a more streamlined faster and more certain approach to assessments of application. \u201c\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government's plans will include a 'National Interest Exemption,' so the Minister can fast track certain approvals for matters of 'national significance', and a 28 day limit for appealing decisions where environmental improvement approvals are not required.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a Labor party caucus meeting today, Murray Watt responded to concerns about the national interest provision.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe explains that it is a direct recommendation from Graham Samuel and its use is primarily for defence and security reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens pre-empted the announcement last week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey pointed to a similar carve-out for nuclear waste management from environmental laws in 2023, to get AUKUS across the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens leader Larissa Waters told the ABC what she thought of the exemption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey're already riddled with loopholes. But rather than fix those loopholes, the proposal by this environment minister under this government is to add additional loopholes and yet more fast track mechanisms for coal and gas. \u201c\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has already rejected a key Greens proposal for a climate trigger in the bill, instead following the Samuel Review's advice to require only emissions disclosure.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Waters suggests a deal was far more likely to be struck between the Government and the Coalition than with the Greens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe coalition, I think, are posturing and probably will end up doing a deal with labor on this.

        "text": "Many Australians plan to rein in Christmas spending this year, a new survey suggests.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome 78 per cent are planning to adjust their spending this Christmas, according to a survey of 1,000 Australians by market researcher Pureprofile.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 38 per cent respondents said they'll cut back spending on gifts, 21 per cent will choose budget-friendly food and drink, and 18 per cent will focus gift-giving on children.\n\n\n\n\n\nRising costs are top of mind, with one in five wishing for relief from soaring food prices this Christmas. They estimate they'll spend $506 on food and drink this year, a 25 per cent increase from $406 in 2024.\n\n\n\nBut while households tighten their budgets, billions of dollars in unclaimed money remains untouched \u2014 and the funds could provide some relief for those eligible amid ongoing cost-of-living pressures.\n\n\n\nUnclaimed superannuation money could be your festive boost\n\nRecent data from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) shows that the pool of lost and unclaimed superannuation has risen by $1.8 billion over the last financial year, taking the total to $17.8 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nLost super includes both uncontactable (funds that can't reach you and haven't received contributions in 12 months) and inactive super (no contributions in five years).\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your fund can't get in touch, they may transfer your balance to the ATO as unclaimed super, which is held until it can be returned or moved to a new fund account.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might have unclaimed super if you've changed jobs, moved house, or forgotten to update your details, or if you simply have multiple superannuation accounts.\n\n\n\nHow to check if you have unclaimed superannuation\n\nYou can check if you have lost or unclaimed super by checking your myGov account, using the ATO app, or phoning the lost super search line on 13 28 65.\n\n\n\n\n\nA full ATO guide on how to check for lost or unclaimed super can be found here .\n\n\n\nLost bank accounts, life insurance, shares, and investments\n\nOn top of that, you could have a slice of an additional $2.3 billion of lost money to be claimed from bank accounts, shares, investments and life insurance policies, according to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis money is managed by the ASIC and comes from accounts that haven't been touched for a certain period, usually seven years of inactivity.\n\n\n\nCash is transferred to ASIC if the account or policy isn't claimed, which can happen if you move, change address, or forget to update your details.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther potential sources include energy companies, universities and health funds, among plenty of others.\n\n\n\nHow to check if you have unclaimed money\n\nTo check if you have unclaimed money, you can use the unclaimed money search on ASIC's Moneysmart website .\n\n\n\n\n\nState governments will also have their own records where you might find lost money from deceased estates, lost share dividends, salaries and wages, cheques, overpayments and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo check for unclaimed money in your state's database, head to the relevant state website below:\n\n",

If the September quarter \u201cproves to be the trough and October to-date trends continue, the stock should do well.\u201d Pressure is rising on the Woolworths CEO, who will face shareholders at the company\u2019s annual general meeting on Thursday, just as arch rival Coles will report its quarterly sales. Coles has been gaining market share on Woolworths. Coles shares dropped 0.6 per cent. Oil and gas giants Woodside and Santos fell for a second session as oil declined further amid mounting signs of oversupply, which quelled a bumper rally triggered by US sanctions on key Russian producers last week. West Texas Intermediate fell 1.9 per cent to again settle close to $US60 a barrel, the steepest daily drop in more than two weeks. Woodside was down 1.2 per cent and Santos shed 0.8 per cent in early trade. CSL also continued its slide, losing a further 5 per cent. The nation\u2019s biggest health company slumped 15.9 per cent on Tuesday after vaccine scepticism led to a plunge in influenza vaccinations in the US, a key market, forcing it to issue a profit warning for its Seqirus vaccine business and delaying the unit\u2019s planned spin-off into a separate company. Building products maker James Hardie shed 1 per cent after US homebuilder D.R. Horton reported weaker profit for the Northern hemisphere summer than expected amid cautious consumer sentiment. James Hardie makes about three quarters of its sales in the US.\n\nMining heavyweights BHP and Rio Tinto advanced, up 0.7 per cent and 0.2 per cent, respectively, while gold miners got some reprieve after their recent losses. Northern Star climbed 2.7 per cent, Evolution Mining added 2.9 per cent and Newmont was up 1.8 per cent as gold steadied after a three-day rout to trade near $US3950 an ounce. On Wall Street overnight, the S&P 500 added 0.2 per cent. The Dow Jones rose 0.3 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 0.8 per cent. All three indexes set all-time highs for a third straight day. Loading Moves were also relatively modest in the bond market as investors waits for a few events that could shake things up. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will announce its latest move on interest rates, while some of the US bourse\u2019s most influential companies will report how much profit they made during the summer. On Thursday, President Donald Trump will meet China\u2019s leader Xi Jinping in hopes of smoothing tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Tech giants Apple (up 0.1 per cent) and Microsoft (up 2 per cent) both climbed, with both companies hitting a valuation of $US4 trillion during the session, joining AI giant Nvidia as the only publicly traded companies worth that figure. Microsoft hit the mark earlier in the year.\n\n\u201cWe expect another strong round of megacap tech earnings reports, given the relentless demand for AI technology and infrastructure,\u201d said Clark Bellin at Bellwether Wealth. \u201cWhile profitability in AI remains an unknown, investors for now are willing to overlook this as the AI arms race heats up.\u201d Amazon, meanwhile, rose 1 per cent after saying it will cut about 14,000 corporate jobs, or about 4 per cent of its corporate workforce, as it ramps up spending on artificial intelligence while cutting costs elsewhere. Until then, profit reports from overnight and the morning were the main drivers of Tuesday\u2019s action. United Parcel Service rallied 8 per cent after delivering stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. UPS also gave a forecast for revenue in the all-important holiday shipping season that was slightly above analysts\u2019 expectations. PayPal climbed 3.9 per cent after saying it made a bigger profit during the summer than analysts expected. It also said it plans to pay its shareholders a dividend every three months, while announcing a deal where internet users will be able to pay for purchases through OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nOn the losing end of Wall Street was Royal Caribbean, which lost 8.5 per cent despite reporting a stronger profit than analysts expected. Its revenue for the latest quarter fell short of expectations. The cruise operator also said it\u2019s seen a \u201cminimal\u201d hit to its business this quarter because of bad weather, along with the temporary closure of one of its exclusive destinations in Haiti. Loading A slowing job market is one of the main reasons Wall Street expects the Fed to announce another cut to interest rates on Wednesday. It would be the second time this year that it\u2019s lowered the federal funds rate in hopes of helping the job market. The widespread expectation is that the Fed will also cut rates for a third time at its final meeting of the year. A lot is riding on that, in part because US stock prices have already rallied to records on expectations for it. That means the most important part of Wednesday\u2019s announcement for Wall Street will be whether Fed Chair Jerome Powell gives any hints about upcoming moves. Fed officials have indicated that they\u2019re likely to keep cutting interest rates next year, but they may have to change course if inflation accelerates beyond its still-high level. That\u2019s because low interest rates can make inflation worse.",

For a quick infusion, marinate for 30 minutes; for the best flavour, cover and chill overnight.\n\nStep 2 Place a medium frying pan or barbecue over high heat. Cook the steaks for about 5 minutes on each side for rare, adjusting based on thickness and your preferred level of doneness. Once cooked, remove the beef and let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing it into strips.\n\nStep 3 Prepare the vermicelli noodles according to the packet instructions (I usually soak them in a bowl of boiling water for 3-5 minutes with a plate on top). Drain and rinse them in cold water. If they\u2019re still wet, drain them on a paper towel.\n\nStep 4 For the chilli-lime dressing, mix ingredients in a small bowl or lidded jar and adjust to taste.

        "text": "As a genre, memoirs can sometimes be lugubrious and self-indulgent, with the reader forced to listen to long stretches of dramatic peaks and scabrous lows, but Brown\u2019s storytelling is brisk and playful, and it\u2019s a pleasure to be in his company.\n\nBoth photos display Brown as a serious fellow, but such gravitas is undermined by the actual contents of this memoir: despite some of the heavier material, (substance abuse, bad health, familial woes and a nervous breakdown, aka \u201cexistentialitis\u201d), a rich vein of humour courses through the book. The tone of Confessions of a Minor Poet is conversational banter, an extended yarn to a mate over a pint or three.\n\nThe cover photo of Confessions of a Minor Poet features Phil Brown: floofy white-haired, black-rimmed glasses, with his hands on his face staring directly and unsmilingly at us. The one on the back is a portrait of him as a young man, tapping away on his trusty typewriter with a reference book nearby. He looks for all the world like a prim, industrious journo focused on breaking a story, or maybe he is in the midst of translating poetic snippets from handwriting to print.\n\nThe author\u2019s previous books have ranged in scope from poetry, travel writing, and even an ambitious search for the meaning of life. In 2019, he wrote a memoir about his childhood in Hong Kong during the 1960s. This latest offering is a sequel of sorts, picking up a decade later upon his return to Australia.\n\nJournalist, jobbing writer and poet Phil Brown in 2004.\n\nIt starts with 18-year-old \u201cBrowneye\u201d (an unfortunate travesty of his name bestowed by fellow surfers), at home in the Gold Coast. Picture this dope-smoking, ratbag teenager who had to repeat year 10 twice because of classroom misdemeanours and a surfing obsession. And yet, the lad was also a bookish maladroit whose companions included Ernest Hemingway, D. H. Lawrence and Patrick White. Oh, and inspired by unrequited love and the lyrics of The Beatles and The Doors, Brown also wrote his first poem \u2013 printed on the back of his surfboard.\n\nFrom this juvenilia period of experimentation (in drugs, booze and verse), the book tracks Brown\u2019s life as he serendipitously falls into journalism almost as an afterthought \u2013 when what he really wanted was to develop his poetic sensibility. His getting of literary wisdom was aided not only by emulating the style of his heroes, but by friendships with esteemed men of letters like \u201cThe Bard of Bunyah\u201d, Les Murray, and \u201cthe Poet of Ordinary Australia\u201d, Bruce Dawe. (It was fitting that Brown, the erstwhile disciple would, decades later, pen Dawe\u2019s obituary in The Courier-Mail.)\n\nThe title of this memoir could easily be thus: Confessions of a Knockabout Journalist and a Minor Poet, Brown\u2019s peripatetic lifestyle in his 20s and beyond led him to work for numerous media outlets: apart from a stint as a radio copywriter, he reported for various publications and across different editorial capacities in and beyond his home state. There are amusing tales of his time in rural newspapers (think bull sales, CWA jubilees, dairy festivals) and plenty of celebrity name-dropping when he was a social gadfly-about-town, with encounters with luminaries including Split Enz, Australian Crawl, Manning Clark, Eric Bana, Alain de Botton and Barry Humphries.",

The trend is also apparent in Australia: recent data shows that one in three Australian children aren\u2019t proficient readers, and that 29 per cent of teens don\u2019t choose to read at all.\n\nWe can all point to reasons: the rival attractions of the internet and social media, limitations to literacy, peer group pressure, and so on. It\u2019s a given that children develop an attachment to books at a very early age, long before they can read, through picture books and the voice of a parent or caregiver reading aloud. But parents these days are often too time-poor and tired to pick out the right books and to give their children this kind of attention.\n\nAuthors worry about the implications - both legal and ethical - of AI-generated books for children. Credit: Getty Images\n\nGuess what? AI has come up with a solution that at first glance seems quite a boon for frazzled parents. Google has launched Gemini Storybook, an app that creates personalised stories that you can read aloud to if you choose. Feed in a few prompts for story and art style and in 10 seconds, Storybook is back with a 10-page digital picture book in any one of 45 languages.\n\nOne fan, Sarah Dooley, told the US journal Publishers Weekly she wanted a story about twins starting kindergarten for her children. \u201cGemini created the sweetest storybook about squirrel sisters starting school together.
