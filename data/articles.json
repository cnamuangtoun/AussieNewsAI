(Supplied: Sourabh Yadav)\n\nMoney aside, Mr Yadav said air purifiers also had limitations.\n\n\"They only work for small spaces, which is why I keep it in my bedroom,\" he said.\n\n\"But as soon as I go into my living room or kitchen, I'll start to feel dizziness or get a headache.\n\n\"It means people will need multiple air purifiers in their home, which most cannot afford.\"\n\n'Simple joys' come with health risks\n\nHome to more than 30 million people, Delhi and its surrounding region routinely rank among the world's most polluted cities.\n\nIndia has six of the 10 most polluted cities globally, and Delhi tops the chart, according to an October report from Switzerland-based air quality monitoring database IQ Air.\n\nIn November, Delhi's AQI stood at 344, a level considered \"severe\" and dangerous to breathe. (AP: Manish Swarup)\n\nEach winter, farmers burn crop residue in nearby states and cooler temperatures trap the smoke that mixes with vehicle and industrial emissions.\n\nIndia's Central Pollution Control Board reported some improvements in recent years due to favourable weather conditions and anti-pollution measures.\n\nBut some studies have found Delhi's air pollution has been more severe than previously estimated.\n\nThe poor air quality has impacted nearly all aspects of life.\n\nHybrid learning has become the norm at schools and universities, offices close regularly, and people mostly stay indoors.\n\nMr Yadav said he has also lost other \"simple joys\" in life, such as enjoying a roadside chai.\n\nHe said buying a chai at a \"tapris\" \u2014 roadside shops that sell tea \u2014 was part of his regular routine and a big part of Indian culture.\n\n\"But now standing on a footpath with your mask off to sip tea feels a little uneasy,\" he said.\n\nSourabh Yadav says he misses his routine of drinking tea from roadside stalls. (AP: Manish Swarup)\n\nNow Mr Yadav buys packed tea to have at home.\n\n\"Sometimes it makes you angry,\" he said.\n\n\" It makes me wonder, God, this air is the very life you breathe. How can you not care? \"\n\nDelhi's residents are fed up.\n\nIn November, hundreds gathered at Delhi's India Gate in a rare protest, urging authorities to act.\n\nIndia's government has taken steps to address air pollution, one being its launch of the National Clean Air Program (NCAP) in 2019.\n\nIts aim was to cut PM2.5 pollution by 20 to 30 per cent by 2024 \u2014 from 2017 levels \u2014 which was later revised to a more ambitious 40 per cent reduction by 2026.\n\nCitizens protest against what they say is the government's lack of action to combat air pollution in Delhi. (AP: Manish Swarup)\n\nHowever, policing Delhi's air quality will require an \"inter-sectoral response\" according to Poornima Prabhakaran, an epidemiologist and public health researcher at Ashoka University.\n\n\"This is due to the multiple sources of pollution,\" Dr Prabhakaran said.\n\n\"Transport is a major source, as well as industrial activity, road and construction and demolition dust.\n\n\" There must be a concerted effort to address all sources to begin to lower the hazardous levels of pollution. \"\n\nAir pollution a silent killer\n\nDelhi's air pollution is shortening the life expectancy of its residents by as much as 12 years, according to a recent Air Quality Life Index report by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.\n\n\"What we generally see during poor air quality times is an increased number of patients who present to the hospital with exacerbation of their asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),\" said Saurabh Mittal, an expert in diseases of the respiratory system at All India Institute of Medical Sciences.\n\nDelhi residents use air purifiers to improve the quality of air inside their homes. (AP: Manish Swarup)\n\n\"Young patients, who were previously asymptomatic, also come with eye, nasal and throat irritation and a persistent cough.\"\n\nDr Mittal said the pollution also had an impact on some people's mental health.\n\n\"Patients with psychological disorders can face low mood and more fatigue in poor air quality,\" he said.\n\nAnd in the long term, there was a higher risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, Dr Mittal added.\n\n\"Higher degree of hypertension and accelerated memory loss are some long-term effects as well,\" he said.\n\nWhen breathing comes at a financial cost\n\nDelhi resident Ashna Sharma and her family have struggled with respiratory issues for years.\n\n\"Stepping outside is nearly impossible, and inside our home every single room now has an air purifier,\" Ms Sharma said.\n\nAshna Sharma says she and her family have spent more on doctor visits in Delhi in the last two months. (Instagram: @ashnaaasharmaa)\n\nThe 26-year-old counselling psychologist and content creator said she was \"genuinely worried\" about her health, but even more for her parents.\n\n\"They are ageing, and this is not the quality of life they deserve,\" she said.\n\nMs Sharma and her family have also racked up more bills as they cope with the air pollution.\n\n\"In just the last two months, we've spent more on medicines and doctor visits than anything else,\" she said.\n\n\" We can't even do something as basic as go for a walk. \"\n\nLooking back over the years, Ms Sharma said the only time she remembers breathing clean air was during the COVID lockdown \"when vehicles were off the roads\".\n\n\"Between Diwali firecrackers, overpopulation, and stubble burning, Delhi has become almost unlivable,\" she said.\n\nCutting emissions 'at the source'\n\nCritics say only long-term measures to cut emissions can bring real relief.\n\nSouth Asia is the global hotspot for air pollution. Can it be fixed? Measures to curb pollution such as installing more pollution monitors and pushing for a switch to cleaner fuels are yet to yield significant results.\n\n\"Delhi's air improves only when emissions are cut at the source,\" said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.\n\n\"These emissions are from industries, vehicles, waste and crop burning,\" Dr Koll said.\n\nHe said cuts in emissions must also be complemented by cleaner energy, efficient transport, and coordination with neighbouring states.\n\nBut Delhi's geography made this challenging, he said.\n\n\"Delhi sits in a basin between the Himalayas and Aravallis mountains where weak winter winds and temperature inversions trap pollutants near the surface,\" he said.",

        "text": "Not long after booking an Australian Open quarterfinal berth, Iva Jovi\u0107 expressed quiet confidence about her chances of defeating upcoming opponent, Aryna Sabalenka.\n\nAs match-ups go, few are tougher than facing world number one Sabalenka on a court where she has twice lifted the championship trophy.\n\nIt would be easy to suggest Jovi\u0107 is simply enjoying the innocence of youth, given she is 18 and the youngest player inside the top 100 on the WTA rankings.\n\nBut the American is not a na\u00efve teenager, blindly caught up in the moment at Melbourne Park.\n\nSabalenka's approach to being world number one Aryna Sabalenka reveals why she has not changed since topping the world rankings.\n\nThe world number 27 has unwavering self-belief in her game, and few could argue about her potential after watching her destroy Yulia Putintseva 6-0, 6-1 in the fourth round.\n\n\"I don't really feel like there is a lot of house money or underdog mentality that I'm feeling,\" Jovi\u0107 said.\n\n\"Because I don't feel like I have been playing anything outside of my comfort zone or outside of my normal level.\n\n\"I have come from two other tournaments where I was playing every day and winning a lot of matches, as well.\n\n\"So this week and the level that I'm showing right now doesn't really feel much different than that.\n\n\"it's just another week that I'm winning more matches, which is nice to see.\"\n\nIva Jovi\u0107 is the youngest player in the top 100 on the WTA rankings. (Getty images: Clive Brunskill)\n\nJovi\u0107's run to the last eight has been impressive.\n\nShe is yet to drop a set and among her victories was a 6-2, 7-6 (7/3) defeat of seventh seed Jasmine Paolini, who is a two-time major finalist and former world number four.\n\nJovi\u0107 did not need to play herself into form, having made the final and semifinal of two Australian Open lead-up events, in Hobart and Auckland, respectively.\n\nHer 2025 season underlined her status as a star on the rise, highlighted by her win at the Guadalajara WTA 500 event as a 17-year-old.\n\nJovi\u0107 ready for Sabalenka\n\nSabalenka, who won the Australian Open in 2023 and 2024, will be a different proposition to Jovi\u0107's previous opponents in Melbourne.\n\nShe arrived at the tournament on the back of winning the Brisbane International and has barely been challenged on her way to the quarterfinals.\n\nJovi\u0107, though, is not intimidated by the Belarusian.\n\nAryna Sabalenka has twice won the Australian Open. (Getty Images: Fred Lee)\n\nWhile buzzing to have come this far at the season-opening major, she sees no reason why she cannot compete against Sabalenka.\n\n\"I'm just excited. I'm in the quarters, which is amazing for me,\" Jovi\u0107 said.\n\n\"So you're going to be playing one of the best players at this stage of the tournament. That's what you want.\n\n\"I'm just trusting the level that I have been able to put out and hopefully that will be enough.\"\n\nTuesday's quarterfinal will be the first time Sabalenka and Jovi\u0107 have played each other on the WTA Tour.",

(ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nHe is not a registered wildlife carer \u2014 a requirement under WA law \u2014 but partly does the job because the nearest registered carer is more than 100km away from town.\n\nThe other reason is that caring for vulnerable kangaroos is his life's passion, which began as a boy.\n\n\"They follow you everywhere. They want the attention, they come up for their cuddles,\" Mr Ostigh said.\n\nWhen the joeys reach 12 to 18 months in age, Mr Ostigh releases them.\n\nIn Roofus's case, he was given to Mr Ostigh by a Boddington local who found the joey as a \"pinky\" in the pouch of his deceased mother.\n\nMr Ostigh has cared for several orphaned joeys, but has a special bond with Roofus. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\nPlenty of company\n\nIn a joey's early months, Mr Ostigh brings them on his day-to-day errands, including to the pub and grocery store.\n\nRoofus is a regular vistor to the pub in Boddington. (ABC South West: Anna Cox)\n\n\"They need to be fed pretty frequently, so they come with me,\" Mr Ostigh said.\n\nHe said Roofus was a welcome visitor to the local watering hole.\n\n\"It's quite amazing really, some of the miners are big burly blokes covered from head to foot in tattoos,\" he said.\n\n\"You'd think they're not the sort of person who would come up and want to pat a roo.\"\n\nPublican Julie McNamara said it was not uncommon to see animals being cared for by kind-hearted locals.\n\nJulie McNamara says the joey is the pub's cutest regular. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\n\"All of the beautiful people and souls in Boddington, they raise whichever animals that are injured \u2026 it's just the normal,\" she said.\n\n\" It's not abnormal to have someone that comes through with a sheep on a leash or a goat on a leash. \"\n\nPub patron Lou Chapman said Mr Ostigh and Roofus made him proud to be a Boddington local.\n\n\"What he's doing is relaying the fact that if you've got an injured animal, he's prepared to take it in and help,\" said Mr Chapman.\n\n\"It's good, it's human nature to be nice, even to a furry friend.\"\n\nOz Ostigh has been taking care of Roofus since he was just a baby joey. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\n'Underground' wildlife carers\n\nIn order to care for wildlife in WA, a licence from the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) is required.\n\nRegistered kangaroo carer and founder of Roo Rescue, Kim Mitchell, said obtaining a licence was becoming increasingly inaccessible.\n\n\"It shouldn't be that hard, it's not rocket science,\" Ms Mitchell said.\n\nShe said the rigorous licensing process had forced many carers to work \"underground\", without official clearances.\n\nThe Boddington Hotel is 130 kilometres south of Perth. (ABC Great Southern: Andrew Chounding)\n\n\"We're only doing it because it's a calling and the animals need us and there is nowhere else for them to go,\" Ms Mitchell said.\n\n\"If the volunteers and wildlife carers stopped, we'd be in a dangerous situation of losing massive amounts of animals.\"\n\nDBCA does not condone the informal care of native animals, but said there was a pathway for temporary care arrangements.\n\n\"A person can apply to DBCA to temporarily possess fauna that is injured or abandoned until it recovers or can fend for itself to ensure successful release back into the wild,\" a spokesperson said.",

        "text": "After a record number of people streamed through Melbourne Park's gates for the first day of the Australian Open this year, Tennis Australia boss Craig Tiley said: \"Cricket's in December. Our objective is we want to own January.\"\n\nPart of that strategy is to make the tournament about more than just tennis. Over the three weeks \u2014 including qualifying week and main draw \u2014 the sporting precinct becomes a behemoth of brand activations, activities and entertainment.\n\nThere's also the slew of influencers who descend on the tournament and post relentlessly across social media. Many get invited to premier experiences and seating by brands in exchange for content to their followers, which can range from a few thousand to millions.\n\nThey have helped Tiley and co make the event not just the place to be during January, but the place to be seen at.\n\nThe 2026 Australian Open has attracted record crowds throughout the tournament. (Getty: James D. Morgan)\n\nMany long-time tennis fans say this is changing the look, feel and experience of going to the Australian Open, with comparisons drawn to the fashion-focused Spring Racing and the changing culture of the Australian Grand Prix.\n\nWith this, some frustration has been levelled at influencers and content creators by the general public \u2014 many of whom have been going to the tournament for years \u2014 with the inundation coinciding with thousands being forced to wait in queues for hours for matches while they get increased access.\n\nOne fan posted online about having to wait five hours in the sun to see Stan Wawrinka play at Kia Arena during week one.\n\nEmily Wade, 28, says she is a genuine fan who is finding it personally frustrating to see the influx of influencers take up seats at marquee matches when others who would genuinely appreciate being there for the tennis are finding it increasingly inaccessible through overcrowding and higher ticket prices.\n\n\"I've been seated behind influencers before and I've witnessed them on their phones, talking, leaving early and I personally don't think it's a good look,\" Wade told the ABC.\n\n\"The only comparison I have is the AFL/AFLW, which has very minimal influencer presence, so that doesn't affect my experience as much as the tennis, where the influencer presence is growing every year.\"\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nKirsty Stekel, 37, said she missed when the Australian Open was more about dressing in team colours rather than fashionably.\n\n\"I love the AO no matter what, but [I'm] definitely mourning the era when you could get cheap ground passes, hop between courts and matches with ease and everyone would show up in groups dressed in countries' colours to support players \u2014 not having to worry about looking chic or fashionable,\" Stekel said.\n\n\"Wearing national colours brought so much energy to the crowd and the day and it's rarely seen anymore.\"\n\nThe role of content creators and influencers at the AO\n\nMost influencers are invited by certain brands or companies to events across the tournament, while organisers have granted increased access to content creators this year.\n\nTennis Australia director of content Brie Stewart told Code Sports: \"We understand that they're coming anyway, and we want to be a part of the story they're creating.\"\n\nBut one popular TikTok influencer, who talked to the ABC on the condition of anonymity, said they were surprised at the level of pressure placed on influencers to be creating content by organisers.\n\n\"I think it was 20 posts [across the tournament] to even be allowed into the AO creator lounge,\" they said. The creator lounge is a designated section within Tennis HQ, where creators can film, edit and work.\n\n\"Some people don't think we work for our money but 20 edited videos [is] a lot of time out of our day. I did the math, that's a minimum [equivalent] of $60K in TikToks,\" the influencer said.\n\nSome Aus Open fans frustrated by 'Opening Week' The Australian Open's \"Opening Week\" has seen record crowds, but some fans are frustrated and disappointed by the confusing messaging.\n\nThe tournament used a \"tier system\" where creators were rewarded with certain perks based on the quantity of content they posted and \"impressions\" from their audience.\n\nThe \"rewards\" included, among other perks, guided backstage tours, accreditation access to the AO grounds, going into the running for AO Reserve seats, AO partner events and seats to the quarterfinals, semifinals and men's and women's final.\n\nThe reward system kicked off the week prior to the AO starting.\n\nOne fan online wrote: \"I think the AO just played the game really well. They got all the influencers in the week before to spruce up the vibe, show off the food and the fun as well as the tennis and it worked.\"\n\nThe influencer added that they felt people would always find negative things to say about \"influencing\" because it was \"a dream job\".\n\n\"We do f**k all and get paid a shit-ton,\" they said.\n\nWhile brands have their own collaboration deals with influencers, Tennis Australia has not paid any or covered their travel costs.\n\n'Not one way to be a fan'\n\nMany tennis fans have also voiced frustration at the lack of tennis etiquette from certain influencers and groups of fans who are more concerned with getting content than watching the matches.\n\nOne fan told the ABC that a group of influencers sat in front of them at a match, took a bunch of photos with a particular branded product and then left without watching any of the match.\n\nDr Kasey Symons, lecturer of communication specialising in sports media at Deakin University, said there would always be some good and bad apples among big groups.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nAs someone who researched fan culture in sports, she said people needed to move away from the idea that there was one kind of sports fan, or one way to do fandom.\n\n\"We need to embrace how all fans want to connect to sport, whether that be as lovers of the sport and high consumers of the competition and match analysis, to casual fans who enjoy the atmosphere, [and] social media users who are engaging in an online community,\" Symons told the ABC.\n\n\"There are always going to be fans that cross the line and annoy other fans, but they are not reflective of the wider group.\n\n\"There are traditional fans who can be disruptive to the enjoyment of other fans, and influencers and new fans and social media users can get it wrong too.\n\n\" This has to become a broader discussion on how to be a good fan rather than what is the 'right' way to be a fan. \"\n\nBut online creator Nicole Bridget pointed out on TikTok that who got invited as guests to events like the Australian Open could still be quite rigid and exclusive.\n\nShe said the issue she had was with brands and agencies not inviting diverse people and \"making it very clear only skinny creators are invited to the AO events for yet another year because apparently if you're curvy it means you don't like sport\".\n\nSome women sport creators have also been frustrated at their lack of being championed by brands during the events.\n\nMeanwhile, others have found it hard to watch female influencers post content flaunting and laughing at their lack of tennis knowledge in a space in which they have worked hard to be taken seriously.\n\nMore women learning about the sport\n\nAtara Thenabadu, 25, said she saw similarities with changing fan cultures of tennis with the F1, which brought in a lot of young female fans after the success of the Netflix documentary series, Drive to Survive.\n\n\"When it comes to the question of whether influencers 'deserve' to be there, I can't help but feel that there are undertones of sexism in some quarters, whether realised or not, that uphold the so-called sacred guardrails of professional sport that for years acted as barriers against women who were interested in learning about the sport,\" Thenabadu told the ABC.\n\nMorgan Riddle, girlfriend of US tennis player Taylor Fritz, has been credited by many for getting more young women into the tennis. (Getty: Cameron Spencer)\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL had an uptick in female viewership after singer Taylor Swift started attending games with her partner, Chiefs player Travis Kelce. While this was a sugar hit for some, it did convert others into NFL fans, particularly women who long felt excluded from the sport or intimidated by its scene.\n\nSuper Bowl champ calls out Taylor Swift haters Philadelphia Eagles superstar Saquon Barkley says he does not understand why Taylor Swift was booed at the Super Bowl, adding that she is part of the reason the NFL is growing internationally and taking games to Australia.\n\n\"That said, I do believe, based on online discourse, that there have been repeated instances of a lack of engagement with the sport itself, such as not watching matches or talking loudly, which I don't think is appropriate,\" Thenabadu said.\n\nThenabadu added that when considering the two perspectives \u2014 while there wasn't a simple solution \u2014 she believed the overcrowding and long-line issues fell at the feet of Tennis Australia, rather than with influencers invited by brands.\n\n\"From my perspective \u2026 I don't feel jealousy or envy when watching influencers attend; however, I would be lying if I said I wasn't surprised by others voicing discontent with influencers who have shown little to no interest in the sport being included,\" she said.",

        "text": "Darryl Bruhn remembers he was about 10 years old when his dad, Brice, was filmed by an out-of-town crew while working at a limestone quarry near Mount Gambier, in South Australia's south east.\n\n\"For him it was just a normal day and the fact there was a film crew there \u2026 he would have been concentrating on his job,\" he said.\n\nLittle did he know, the film would be distributed around the world and seen by people who would end up moving to Australia.\n\nDarryl Bruhn has travelled the world but still feels a strong connection to Mount Gambier, where he grew up. (Supplied: Darryl Bruhn)\n\nThe film crew was part of the Commonwealth Film Unit (now Film Australia), and was visiting the town to create a Mount Gambier edition of the Life in Australia film series.\n\nThe films \u2014 commissioned by the Department of Immigration in the 1960s \u2014 screened at embassies and High Commissions, particularly in the United Kingdom, to encourage migration to Australia.\n\nMount Gambier was one of 12 locations around Australia highlighted in the series, including major capital cities and other regional towns.\n\nA glimpse into regional life\n\nReleased in 1964, the Mount Gambier film follows a local family through the rhythms of work and leisure in the region.\n\nIt showcases local industries such as forestry and cheesemaking, and highlights important locations including the hospital, Commercial Street and Brownes Lake.\n\nMr Bruhn does not remember much about the film from when he was a child, but parts of it were immortalised in the region.\n\n\"They had a whole lot of photographs that were taken at that time as part of that series and there was a photograph of [my dad] cutting limestone on a billboard on the entrance to Mount Gambier,\" he said.\n\n\"I think I did see the footage at some time later on, and then it was only probably 12-18 months ago when it popped up on Facebook.\"\n\nThe Mount Gambier Life in Australia film captured many places in the region 60 years ago, including the Valley Lakes precinct. (Supplied: National Film and Sound Archive)\n\nMr Bruhn moved to Adelaide about 20 years ago, but still visits family in the region about once a year.\n\n\"When I [drive] in, I'll come in from Millicent and I'll look up on the hill and see the lake and the tower ... that's always when something happens in my stomach,\" he said.\n\n\"When you enter the pine forest areas, that's what tells you that you're home in Mount Gambier.\n\n\" I guess there is some nostalgia about things that [people] remember and things that you've forgotten until you see something that triggers your memory. \"\n\nSelling regional Australia to migrants\n\nTowns featured in the Life in Australia films were chosen because they were considered attractive for migrants.\n\nProfessor Kate Darian-Smith from the School of Historical and Philosophical Studies at the University of Melbourne said they were intentional marketing campaigns.\n\n\"The one on Mount Gambier, for instance, really highlights that this is a regional place where there is industrial growth,\" she said.\n\n\"They're not documentaries in the sense that they're not including those who are excluded; there is really no reference or mention of First Nations people \u2026 [and] no real addressing [of] any social or class divisions.\"\n\nThe Life in Australia films showcased an idealistic view of what it was like to live in Australia. (Supplied: National Film and Sound Archive)\n\nPost-World War II migration in the 1950s and 60s was lower than expected, and the Australian government wanted to boost numbers.\n\n\"Those coming from Britain were always seen as the most desired cohort and the group of people Australia really wanted to attract,\" Professor Darian-Smith said.\n\n\"The key message is there are jobs there for migrants \u2014 both skilled and unskilled \u2014 and that the economy itself is modernising.\"\n\nProfessor Darian-Smith said the series was effective, but many did not stay longer than a few years.\n\n\"A lot of British migrants who were lured by films like this \u2026 found when they came, the reality was somewhat different,\" she said.\n\n\"Up to about 25 per cent of all migrants coming in the 50s and 60s returned to Britain or other countries of origin because the hype didn't quite ... [match] their own experience.\"\n\nRestored for modern viewing\n\nThe Life in Australia films have now been re-released on YouTube in 4K by the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia.\n\nThe old hospital in Mount Gambier was a major employer for residents in the 1960s. (Supplied: National Film and Sound Archive)\n\nSenior manager of the enterprises team with the archive, Bronwyn Dowdall, said digitising the archived film was not typical.\n\n\"The process is known as scanning and grading \u2014 not a restoration as such,\" she said.\n\n\"They're really interesting time capsules; definitely a portrayal of an idealised Australia \u2014 the Australia that the government at the time wanted the world to see.\"\n\nThe videos have been popular for those interested in looking back to the 1960s, as well as the locals who featured in the films.\n\n\"We're really hoping that people are able to engage with the material to look back and reflect on what their town was like at that time,\" Ms Dowdall said.\n\n\"It's always fun to see places that you're very familiar with \u2026 decades ago.\"\n\nThe National Film and Sound Archive's project allows people to see what the famous Blue Lake looked like 60 years ago. (Supplied: National Film and Sound Archive)\n\nWhile the Life in Australia series has not been recreated since, its legacy lives on in the form of a booklet distributed by the Department of Home Affairs to new migrants.\n\nMs Dowdall said she would like to see what a modern version of the films would look like.\n\n\"The Commonwealth Film Unit doesn't exist anymore, so it would be interesting if anybody had that as a project,\" she said.\n\n\"There could be production companies that are interested \u2026 but productions like that can be really expensive.\"",

        "text": "The last time a train travelled across the River Derwent was more than a decade ago, and it was carrying freight rather than passengers.\n\nHobart's rail corridor has sat unused since 2014, following the opening of the Brighton Transport Hub on the northern side of the river.\n\nIt has also been more than 50 years since passenger rail rolled into Tasmania's capital, although short heritage rides have recently commenced.\n\nA Tasman Limited train winds through Hobart's northern suburbs in 1974. (trains-worldexpresses.com )\n\nDespite this, there remained some in the community who wanted to see the railway returned to its former glory.\n\nBut the removal of the heritage-listed Bridgewater Bridge's main lift span this month marks, for some, the final nail in the coffin for Hobart's rail corridor.\n\nLoss of rail connection a 'matter of regret'\n\nTasmanian Transport Museum president Jeff Bronstein said the loss of the Bridgewater rail crossing is deeply felt in Tasmania's rail heritage community.\n\n\"It's always sad and a matter of regret when you see railway infrastructure, especially iconic railway infrastructure like the Bridgewater Bridge, come to the end of its life and removed,\" he said.\n\nMr Bronstein said the physical structure was not the only thing lost, but also \"all the stories and all the human activities that were involved with the construction, design and operation of the bridge\".\n\nHe said it closes off future possibilities for rail.\n\n\"When a piece of infrastructure like rail is taken away, it's very difficult to restore it, to have it replaced, due to the costs involved with such large pieces of engineering,\" Mr Bronstein said.\n\nThe state government described the bridge as being in poor condition and requiring high maintenance costs, resulting in its removal.\n\nIt has been replaced by a four-lane bridge that opened to traffic in June 2025 and cost $786 million.\n\nThe new Bridgewater Bridge opened in June last year. (Supplied: State Growth)\n\nDisused rail corridor to become rapid busway\n\nThe government is pushing ahead with plans to use parts of the northern suburbs rail corridor for a rapid busway.\n\nThe details are yet to be confirmed, and a broader business case is overdue for release.\n\nLoading...\n\nOnce the business case is complete, the state government will seek additional funding from the Commonwealth for the busway.\n\nThere are also plans for the rapid bus system to connect to the yet-to-be-built Macquarie Point stadium precinct to help move large numbers of event goers.\n\nBut despite that, one group still hopes passenger rail will run through northern Hobart yet again.\n\nToby Rowallan from the Hobart Northern Suburbs Rail Action Group. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\nThe Hobart Northern Suburbs Rail Action Group (HNSRAG) envisions an interconnected public transport network for the northern suburbs, where buses and park-and-ride facilities feed into train stations.\n\nIt believes trains would help ease congestion on Hobart's key arterial roads, as well to reduce urban sprawl, and increase housing density.\n\nHNSRAG president Toby Rowallan said the removal of the old Bridgewater Bridge makes a future rail link \"a little bit harder\", though not impossible.\n\nA visualisation of a 2013 plan for light rail in Hobart, since discarded.\n\nCould Tasmania's passenger train service ever make a comeback? Passenger trains, along with trams and trolley buses, were once part of Tasmania's transport mix.\n\n\"It just means that we'd have to do that in stages. We'd have to go from Hobart to Granton first, and then once it was a success, it would be easy to justify reconnecting the railway and putting a stop on the other side of the river,\" Mr Rowallan said.\n\nServicing the broader Brighton municipality remains an important area of interest for him, as its \"one of the highest areas of transport disadvantage\".\n\n\"People can't afford a car and have reduced bus services, and now there is no other option possible because the rail line has been removed,\" he said.\n\nThe lift span on the old bridge has long been a feature in Hobart's northern suburbs. (Supplied: Department of State Growth)\n\nHeritage train ride expansion still happening\n\nMr Bronstein said the museum's heritage train operations between Glenorchy and Berriedale, along with its plans to expand to Granton in the coming years, would not be affected by the removal of the old bridge.\n\nBut the removal of the rail crossing connecting both sides of the River Derwent will prevent any further expansion plans across the river.\n\n\"Once we've established our rail operations as far as Granton, it does become problematic for the museum not having a direct fixed rail link across the Derwent River.\"\n\nThe finished Bridgewater Bridge in Hobart. (Supplied: State Growth)\n\nWhat happened to Hobart's trams? Which was the first Australian city to get an electric tram network? Melbourne? Sydney? Nope. Try Hobart. But where did they go?\n\nHe said the museum may eventually need to move locomotives using heavy equipment or set up a new depot near the old Bridgewater Junction station, but any solution was years away and would require government assistance.\n\n\"The costs of establishing a new fixed rail link would be prohibitive,\" he said.\n\nWhile one option could involve bussing passengers across the new bridge as trains are moved separately, Mr Bronstein admits the idea is unlikely to be practical.\n\nKeeping history alive\n\nEven though the Bridgewater rail crossing has been removed, parts of its history will be preserved.\n\nThe Department of State Growth has agreed to give the museum access to some of the bridge's dismantled rail infrastructure.\n\nTasmania's most expensive infrastructure project opens to public Tasmania's largest and most expensive transport infrastructure project \u2014 the Bridgewater Bridge \u2014 has been opened to the public with thousands expected to walk it on foot.\n\n\"We are hopeful that we'll be able to get access to some welded rail. It's good quality rail. There's sleepers there, there's signalling points and those kinds of bits of infrastructure, signage et cetera,\" Mr Bronstein said.\n\nHe said the salvaged materials would be used to support the museum's plans to expand to Granton and establish a major western terminus.\n\n\" Aspects of it will still see the light of day in terms of railway operations. Just not the way it was originally intended. \"\n\nThe department intends to incorporate elements of the old bridge into a future interpretive site, giving the structure a second life in the area's storytelling.",

        "text": "For the first time since 2020, Anzac Day will fall on a Saturday this year, which means most Australians will not get a weekday off.\n\nIn 2026, only the Australian Capital Territory and Western Australia will have Monday, April 27, as a public holiday.\n\nThe ACT announced it will transfer the public holiday to the Monday, and said: \"Anzac Day remains a national day of significance on the 25th April and all commemorative activities will be occurring on the Saturday.\"\n\nIn WA, the government has designated both the Saturday and Monday as public holidays.\n\nFor the first time since 2020, Anzac Day will fall on a Saturday this year. ( )\n\nThe reason comes down to the legislation in each state.\n\nWhen Anzac Day falls on a Sunday, people in Queensland, South Australia, WA, the Northern Territory, and the ACT get the public holiday on the Monday per their state's laws, whereas those in New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria do not.\n\nSo how does it all get decided, and how can you maximise time off from work?\n\nWho can decide to offer a substitute public holiday?\n\nIn Queensland, if Anzac Day falls on a Saturday only the Minister for Industrial Relations, Jarrod Bleijie, can \u2014 by Gazette notice \u2014 substitute another day for a public holiday, according to the Queensland Holidays Act 1983.\n\nBut in January, Mr Bleijie said he would not be moving to substitute Anzac Day for another day as it fell on a Saturday, rather than a Sunday.\n\n\"My understanding under the legislation is the Anzac Day falling on a Saturday is the public holiday,\" he said.\n\n\"If it was to fall on a Sunday \u2026 it does then get substituted for a Monday.\n\n\"We have no intention to change [the legislation] at the moment. We're always in discussion with RSL Queensland and our veterans, but at this stage there's no plans to change that.\"\n\nQueensland's deputy premier Jarrod Bleijie declined to give Queenslanders a substitute Anzac holiday. ( )\n\nQueensland is not the only state that can shift its public holidays, with legislation in SA, NSW, the NT, and Vic also allowing for state government ministers to make one-off decisions.\n\nIn Tasmania, changes can only be made be legislative reform.\n\nIn relation to Anzac Day specifically, in the ACT, the Holidays Act 1958 outlines that if April 25 falls on a Sunday, the following Monday is a public holiday.\n\nIt is also currently legislated in WA, with the Public and Bank Holidays Act 1972 outlining that, when Anzac Day falls on a Saturday or Sunday, the next following Monday is also a public holiday.\n\nWhen is the next public holiday?\n\nPublic holidays shared nationwide: New Years Day, January 1\n\nAustralia Day, January 26\n\nGood Friday, April 3\n\nEaster Monday, April 6\n\nChristmas Day, December 25\n\nBoxing Day, December 26 (plus substitute day on December 28 for most states)\n\nWith 2026 now underway, let's take a look at when public holidays will fall this year and how to make the most of them.\n\nMainstream public holidays are shared widely among the states and territories.\n\nThese include Christmas Day, Good Friday, and Easter Monday.\n\nSome jurisdictions get a part-day holiday on Christmas Eve, with the day considered a public holiday after 6pm in Queensland and 7pm in SA and the NT.\n\nAll states and territories provide for an additional public holiday on December 28 because Boxing Day falls on a Saturday this year.\n\nLabour Day differs between the states. WA will have a public holiday on Monday, March 2, while Vic will have public holiday a week later on Monday, March 9. Queensland will have a day off on Monday, May 4, while the ACT, NSW and SA will have their public holiday on Monday, October 5.\n\nIn the NT, the day is known as May Day and is held on May 4, while in Tas it is called Eight Hours Day and is held on March 9.\n\nTasmania's Labor Day-equivalent Eight Hours Day pays tribute to those who pushed for standard working hours. ( )\n\nAll the states and territories get a King's Birthday public holiday on Monday, June 8, apart from Queensland, which has theirs on Monday, October 5, and WA, which will observe the holiday on Monday, September 28, this year.\n\nBeyond the classics, some states have unique, exclusive days off not shared by other states.\n\nQueensland Queensland's unique public holiday this year is the Ekka holiday, which will fall on Wednesday, August 12. New South Wales NSW has a Bank Holiday on Monday, August 3, but it is not a declared public holiday and only retail bank branches and certain financial institutions are required to close, unless staff voluntarily choose to work. ACT The ACT will get extra holidays for Canberra Day on Monday, March 9, and Reconciliation Day on Monday, June 1. Northern Territory The NT will celebrate Picnic Day on Monday, August 3, and also get a post-7pm public holiday on New Year's Eve. South Australia Adelaide Cup Day gets a Monday public holiday on March 9 in SA. Tasmania Tasmania's public holidays vary throughout the state. Parts of Tasmania will get a day off on February 9 for the Royal Hobart Regatta. Some areas will observe a day off for the Royal Hobart Show on Thursday, October 22, while others will have a public holiday on Monday, November 2, for Recreation Day. Victoria The Friday before the AFL Grand Final is a public holiday in Victoria, with the game held on the last Saturday in September. This year, the public holiday will fall on September 25. There will also be a public holiday for Melbourne Cup Day on Tuesday, November 3. Western Australia WA observes an additional Anzac Day holiday on Monday, April 27, and Western Australia Day on Monday, June 1.\n\nA full list of holidays for each state can be found on the Fair Work website.\n\nHow can you make the most of annual leave?\n\nIf you have annual leave banked up, you may be able to use this in conjunction with public holidays to maximise consecutive days off.\n\nFour days of annual leave in April \u2014 7, 8, 9, 10 \u2014 becomes a 10-day break with the Good Friday and Easter public holidays.\n\nCareful planning can turn seven days of annual leave into a 16-day break over the summer holidays. ( )\n\nTaking annual leave on Friday, June 5, leads to a four-day weekend with the King's Birthday on the Monday, except in Queensland and WA.\n\nAnd getting organised in advance for the 2026/27 Christmas season can see seven days of annual leave turned into a 16-day holiday break.\n\nJust take annual leave days off on December 21, 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, and 31.\n\nFor the average full-time worker in Australia with four weeks of annual leave, that will leave you with eight days of annual leave left over.",

What type of physical shape do you hope to be in? And what are the activities you want to be able to continue doing? While there\u2019s no crystal ball to predict your future health, there are a few basic tests you can give yourself to gauge your current strength, power, cardiovascular fitness and balance \u2014 all of which will influence your physical abilities going forward. These kinds of tests have been associated with longevity and independent living. They\u2019re also proxies for activities that many people want to be able to do in old age, like getting down on the floor to play with grandchildren or travelling and exploring a new city by foot. These 4 basic tests give you a great indication of how you\u2019re ageing. Getty Images It\u2019s never too early to begin training for your later years, said Stuart Phillips, a professor of kinesiology at McMaster University in Ontario. People naturally lose strength and muscle mass with age, so you want your starting point to be as good as possible. Getting a head start on training is \u201cmoney in the bank,\u201d Phillips said. It\u2019s also never too late to improve your physical abilities, he added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got data showing that nonagenarians, so people in their 10th decade of life, or in their 90s, can make gains in strength and function with just a little bit of even light activity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTry these four tests to determine where you currently stand. If you don\u2019t perform as well as you might have hoped, don\u2019t worry: A few strength, conditioning and balance exercises, done regularly, can help you improve your score on each one. Editor's pick Fitness The goal posts for a longer, healthier life are closer than you think 1. Sitting-Rising Test The goal with this assessment is to go from standing to sitting on the floor, and back up again, using the least amount of support as possible. The test is scored on a 10-point scale \u2014 five points for sitting down and five points for standing up \u2014 and you lose a point for every hand, knee or other body part you use to help yourself. Subtract a half point if you\u2019re unsteady or lose your balance. Adults in their 30s and 40s should aim for a perfect 10, said Dr. Claudio Gil Ara\u00fajo, the dean of research and education at the Exercise Medicine Clinic in Brazil, who developed the test. Anyone over 60 who gets an 8 is \u201cin very good shape,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe test evaluates strength, power, balance and flexibility. Ara\u00fajo has also shown it\u2019s a predictor of mortality. A recent study of his looked at more than 4,000 adults age 46 to 75 and found that, over the course of 12 years, the people who scored 4 or below on the sitting-rising test had death rates nearly four times higher than those who scored a 10. He said that was primarily because people with low scores were at a higher risk for falls. 2. Walking speed assessment How fast someone walks at their normal gait is \u201ca very important indicator of functional ability and vitality,\u201d said Jennifer Brach, a professor of health and rehabilitation sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cIt is predictive of future decline; it\u2019s predictive of mortality, nursing home placement, disability, a whole host of different things,\u201d she said. To assess your walking speed, measure out 4 meters, or about 13 feet, on a straight, flat surface, and time how long it takes you to cover the distance. (Remember, you\u2019re walking at your normal speed, not as fast as you can.) People of all ages should aim for a gait of at least 1.2 meters per second, a little over three seconds total. Brach recommended people retest themselves every few months. \u201cIf the value changes, that can be a warning sign,\u201d she said. That\u2019s because while walking feels like a simple task, it requires proper functioning of the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, vestibular (balance), sensory and nervous systems. A slower gait could indicate that there\u2019s a problem in any one of those systems that may need to be investigated and addressed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Grip strength test Related Article Nutrition Can we call butter and beef tallow \u2018healthy fats\u2019? Grip strength is also related to mortality. While that connection may seem far-fetched, experts say a grip strength test serves as a helpful indicator for how active a person is in their daily life. \u201cWhen you\u2019re using your hands more, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re doing things more,\u201d said Cathy Ciolek, president of the American Physical Therapy Association Geriatrics. \u201cYou\u2019re carrying groceries, you\u2019re opening the car door, you\u2019re picking up a grandchild.\u201d All of those things work your hands, she said, and the more you do them, the better your grip strength. Grip strength is also important for maintaining independence with household tasks like cooking. (Think about pulling a heavy dish out of the oven.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA doctor or physical therapist typically assesses grip strength using a special device called a dynamometer. To test yourself at home, try walking for 60 seconds while holding a heavy weight in each hand (also known as a farmer\u2019s carry), suggested Dr. Nima Afshar, a physician at concierge medical practice Private Medical. Start with lighter weights and work your way up to heavier ones over time. If you experience hand or body pain, stop. There aren\u2019t age-related norms for the farmer\u2019s carry like there are with a dynamometer. But Afshar said a 45-year-old man should aim to carry two 60-pound dumbbells, a 65-year-old two 40-pound dumbbells and an 85-year-old two 25-pounders. For a woman at those ages, goal weights are 40 pounds, 25 pounds and 15 pounds in each hand. 4. Single-leg stand Just as strength naturally declines with age, so does balance. And that raises the risk for falls \u2014 a major cause of injury and death in older adults. Testing one\u2019s balance is as simple as standing on one leg. Adults should aim for a minimum of 10 seconds on at least one side. For an added challenge, Afshar recommended attempting the test with your eyes closed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a study Ara\u00fajo published in 2022, 20% of adults age 51 to 75 were unable to make it to 10 seconds. And those individuals had an 84% higher chance of dying in the next seven years, possibly because they were unhealthier at the start of the study. \u201cYou can\u2019t predict an individual\u2019s precise mortality\u201d with these types of tests, Afshar said. But if you\u2019re below average on any of them, it\u2019s likely you won\u2019t fare as well long term. That said, he added, all of these metrics \u2014 strength, fitness, balance \u2014 can be improved, and as you improve, your risk of dying soon goes down.

        "text": "Resilience is something Stajcic has always tried to teach his players \u2013 and there have been many over two and a half decades. From his national teams (Matildas, Young Matildas, Philippines) and clubs (Sydney FC Women, Central Coast Mariners Men, Perth Glory Men, Wanderers Men) and, right at the start, the NSWIS Women\u2019s Football Program, through which he nurtured the Matildas\u2019 golden generation. Resilience is also a muscle he has been forced to flex during some low periods so severe \u2013 namely his Matildas sacking and all the erroneous innuendo accompanying it \u2013 it\u2019s perplexing to the outsider he did not give coaching away completely and start fresh as a landscaper or diving instructor, or literally anything else unrelated to football. Loading \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just love the game,\u201d he reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing I can thank my parents for, and especially my father, who sacrificed everything for me to play the game and follow my dreams within the game. They came to Australia as immigrants from Yugoslavia without a word of English or a cent to their names, and gave me and my brother everything they could. Football was one of the things that they gave us. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky that this country gives you the opportunity to go through the ranks. As a first-generation Australian, to be able to go from immigrant parents without a cent to their name to coaching a country is pretty special. And little things like being the first Australian-born coach to win a game at a World Cup \u2013 and having three wins now at a World Cup \u2013 make it special, and more recognition for the sacrifice everyone put in for you to be able to follow your dreams.\n\n\u201cSo this is probably more recognition for my family than for me. My mother and father, and my wife and my kids, who have sacrificed the most out of everyone.\u201d Careful, because this is not a eulogy. Stajcic is only 52 and still very much a coach, albeit one out of work (\u201cJust hanging in there,\u201d he laughs). But the past is what earned him this rare honour, bestowed on only a handful of Australian coaches. Matildas players listen to direction from Stajcic in 2018. Credit: Getty Images \u201cEspecially in women\u2019s football,\u201d he says. \u201cI started off on the journey when everyone thought it was uncool \u2013 the poor cousin of the poor cousin. Being disregarded and discriminated against, and not thought of or cared about by pretty much everyone in administration. I was warned off going down that field, but it didn\u2019t bother me really. I just loved the game, and anyone who loved the game I was happy to share my time with. \u201cTo think of the things we had to go through at the NSW Institute of Sport, just to get a training field and gear and women\u2019s-sized clothing, and revenues and resources for the team. It was a pretty amazing ride. And to think about the talent ID \u2013 of finding those players from all around NSW and Australia, and how the group sort of grew up together and has become the golden generation. That probably gives me the greatest joy and pride, to see how we all evolved together as coaches and players, and went from virtually nothing to \u2013 for me \u2013 becoming probably the best team in the world.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the Matildas reached a record high FIFA ranking of No.4, behind No.3 England, No.2 Germany, and long-time leaders the United States. It was in July of that year that Australia first beat the US \u2013 a major milestone in Seattle after 26 fruitless attempts. Sam Kerr, Steph Catley and their contemporaries of 2023 World Cup fame were in the early 20s. With retired Matildas goalkeeper Lydia Williams. They almost repeated that 1-0 Tournament of Nations triumph at the 2018 edition (during which a 15-year-old Mary Fowler made her senior international debut against Brazil) but for an injury-time equaliser in Connecticut. Still, Megan Rapinoe shook Stajcic\u2019s hand after that game and, in a casual chat, gave her former Sydney FC coach the impression that her all-conquering US team were wary of Australia leading into the 2019 World Cup. This evidence, on the back of finishing runners-up at April\u2019s Asian Cup in Jordan, was enough for Stajcic to believe his Matildas were genuine World Cup contenders. Seven months later he was at the centre of one of the most controversial dismissals in Australian football history. \u201cIt hurt my soul,\u201d he remembers. Then he repeats it. \u201cIt hurt my soul.\u201d\n\nThe personal trauma was compounded, he says, by the knowledge he\u2019d been offered the highly lucrative England head coaching job (China came knocking too), but turned it down. \u201cFor four or five times the money, all the resources, they told me they were going to host the [2022] Euros, everything,\u201d he says. \u201cI knocked it back and then Phil Neville took it after me. I wanted to stay with Australia for the [2019] World Cup \u2026 and 12 months later I got sacked. I always said I\u2019m not going to be that loyal ever again, but then I do it again. And again.\u201d Alen Stajcic\u2019s magic touch set up the Central Coast Mariners for success. Credit: Getty Images Perhaps such loyalty is part of the reason he is now an OAM? \u201cNot sure, to be honest,\u201d is his answer, but he does know he possessed a \u201cwillingness to fight and fight back\u201d. Three months later he was hired as Central Coast\u2019s caretaker coach, then permanent coach, and in early 2021 oversaw the Mariners\u2019 first back-to-back A-League Men wins since December 2017. The competition\u2019s laughing stock had transformed into table-toppers. Western United\u2019s coach at the time, Mark Rudan, called him \u201ca magician, as far as I\u2019m concerned\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic,\u201d Stajcic said pragmatically. \u201cThe magic is hard work.\u201d\n\nIn late 2021, when was appointed head coach of the Philippines \u2013 he went on to qualify the nation for its first Women\u2019s World Cup and they made their debut in the 2023 tournament with a win over co-hosts New Zealand \u2013 and handed the reins to assistant and club great Nick Montgomery, the foundations were laid for back-to-back championships, a premiership and an AFC Cup. \u201cNow six or seven of those guys have played [for the] Socceroos \u2013 from a team that, when I took over in 2019, had won one game out of 21 \u2013 and are now in contention for this next World Cup,\u201d Stajcic says. Stajcic with his Philippines coaching staff. Credit: Reuters \u201cThat was a really massive highlight for me \u2013 knowing I could do it in men\u2019s football as well and achieve so much. It was an unknown really. I had coached elite boys from 12 to 18 for 10 years as well. But coaching a professional men\u2019s team? That was something that I had to learn. \u201cBut the longer I went on the more I realised, especially as society as well has evolved, I think the genders have come closer together. And especially the younger generation who\u2019ve grown up with phones and social media and all those kinds of things. So the problems they face and the dilemmas they have are more closely aligned with each other.\u201d",

        "text": "How Australians choose to spend their day on 26 January can vary greatly. It's a date that sparks mixed feelings and carries different meanings for different communities.\n\nFor some, it's a day of celebration; for others, it's a historical day of mourning.\n\nWith almost a third of the population born overseas \u2014 an estimated 8.6 million, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics \u2014 Australia is one of the most multiculturally diverse countries in the world.\n\nHowever, this Australia Day comes at a time of heightened social tension, with recent data showing national belonging is at its lowest levels in more than a decade.\n\nDespite this, support for multiculturalism remains high, according to ANU's 2024 Mapping Social Cohesion report.\n\nFor many migrant Australians, 26 January remains an important milestone: the day they became Australian. This year, 20,600 people from over 150 countries will make their citizenship pledge as part of Australia Day events around the country, joining the more than six million people who've become citizens since the first ceremonies were held in 1949.\n\nTo mark the date, SBS News has spoken with five migrant Australians from India, South Sudan, Israel, China and Italy about what the day \u2014 and being Australian \u2014 means to them.\n\nFrom tasting Vegemite to quiet reflection\n\nKaran Raina came to Australia from India back in 2013 as a master's student, chasing a fresh start and a chance to build his career in a place \"known for its lifestyle and opportunity,\" he tells SBS News.\n\nRaina described his first experience of Australia Day in 2014 as a \"welcome to the club moment\".\n\n\"Coming from overseas, the concept of a BBQ and a day at the beach was the quintessential Aussie experience I heard the most,\" he says.\n\nKaran Raina's first Australia Day was spent at the local park, trying Vegemite for the first time. Credit: Supplied\n\n\"I joined in by heading to the local park with some fellow students, trying Vegemite for the first time, and just soaking up the sun and the relaxed atmosphere.\"\n\nAfter 10 years in Australia, Raina says his January 26 plans are quieter and more reflective.\n\n\"I usually use the public holiday to relax, catch up with close friends and reflect on how far I've come since I first arrived with just a couple of suitcases in 2013.\"\n\nIt's less about the big party and more about appreciating the peaceful life I have here.\n\nThis year, he is also reflecting on his \"dual identity\" as a migrant.\n\n\"Even when things feel tense in the news or the media, I focus on the reality of my day-to-day life ... For me, being Australian is about the contribution I make every day.\"\n\n'This country is built by immigrants'\n\nChef Luca Quadri came to Australia from Italy in 2015. Eight years later , he became a citizen.\n\n\"I was already a chef, so for me, it was a little bit easier because I could get a sponsor, or I could get a skill visa through my skills as a chef,\" he tells SBS News.\n\nA decade after arriving, Quadri says he feels he is part of Australia now.\n\n\"I feel like I have two homes, one in Australia and one in Italy.\"\n\nLuca Quadri says he now has two homes in Australia and Italy. Credit: Supplied\n\nDespite recent social tensions in Australia, partly driven by a spate of anti-immigration rallies, Quadri says he is unfazed, choosing to ignore the rhetoric.\n\n\"I don't believe they're [rallies] important because this country is built by immigrants. So I think they're just people that don't understand how this country works and how we arrived here.\"\n\nThe first time he heard about 26 January was from a coworker, who told him: \"It's Australia Day tomorrow, we're going to celebrate.\"\n\n\"As an immigrant here, I don't have [strong feelings about the date]. I just think that if it's just a day when we celebrate Australia and as a country and we all get together ... it should be celebrated.\"\n\nListening to First Nations voices\n\nBorn in South Sudan, Andrew Gai is a family violence prevention practitioner and community advocate. He arrived in Australia in 2006 under the humanitarian visa program, and became a citizen in 2009.\n\nBefore then, Gai says he had never celebrated a country's national day, and at first, he celebrated Australia Day passionately, but stopped after learning what the date represents for First Nations people.\n\n\"My community association used to organise youth and family fun days ... We stopped organising this event,\" he says.\n\n\"Recently, a couple of young people asked me if we were doing Australia Day event again and I said 'sadly no' and explained to them why and they understood.\"\n\nAndrew Gai no longer celebrates on 26 January after learning about the \"pain attached to this date\" for First Nations. Credit: Supplied\n\nIt's a day that requires sensitivity and the acknowledgment of historical injustices, he tells SBS News.\n\n\"Australia Day cannot be approached as business as usual,\" he says.\n\nWe can participate in national celebrations while also acknowledging the pain attached to this date and listening to the voices of First Nations peoples.\n\nGai is proud of his South Sudanese heritage, while at the same time, expresses gratitude for being Australian. He says seeing the recent anti-immigration rallies, including those planned for today, is disappointing.\n\nBut he believes \"we are more united as Australians than what we hear in the media\".\n\n\"I call these rallies un-Australian as they carry divisive and racially motivated agenda,\" Gai says.\n\n\"With exception of the First Nations peoples, we all came on different journeys, and all have very unique stories, but we all call Australia home now and no one should be made to feel like they don't belong here.\"\n\nPride despite division\n\nPhysiotherapist Gil Jelin and her husband moved to Australia from Israel in 2017.\n\n\"We always wanted to try living overseas, and in my last year of studies in Israel, I came to Australia to learn from a physio, that blew my mind ... I decided I wanted to continue to work with him and it pushed us to immigrate,\" she tells SBS News.\n\nGil Jelin believes the country is \"as divided as it's ever has been\" since she arrived in 2017 from Israel. Credit: Supplied\n\nBut as a Jewish migrant, Jelin says she \"doesn't feel great\" being an Australian at the moment, especially in the wake of the 14 December Bondi terror attack .\n\n\"I feel that right now it's as divided as it has ever been in the past eight years,\" she says.\n\n\"So much hate, politics, people who think they know you or what you've been through. Feeling like the government doesn't take antisemitism seriously enough ... So, not a walk in the park.\"\n\nHowever, this Australia Day, Jelin plans to spend time with her family and friends.\n\n\"[We'll] cheers our beers by the pool and enjoy the luxuries and privileges we have to be Australian.\"\n\n\"We love this country and we are proud to be a part of it and celebrate this day,\" she says.\n\nMoving forward, not backward\n\nOriginally from China, Felix Dong moved to Australia as a student in 2011 to complete his university studies. He was granted permanent residency and later became a citizen in 2023.\n\n\"We are not allowed dual citizenship [in China], so choosing Australian citizenship means giving up many legal and practical ties to our country of origin ... It also means returning to China in the future involves visas and additional barriers,\" he tells SBS News.\n\n\"I feel proud of becoming an Australian ... and I believe Australia's success as a multicultural country comes from strong legislation and genuine implementation.\"\n\nI still believe strongly in the Australian multicultural model, even during times of tension.\n\nOver the years, Dong has spent Australia Day like many other public holidays \u2014 occasionally attending community activities or taking a break.\n\n\"Like many international students, my early understanding was quite limited. Occasionally, I attended community events, but it did not initially carry a deep personal meaning for me.\"\n\n\"The most meaningful Australia Day experience for me was the year I became a citizen. That was the first time the day felt truly significant on a personal level,\" Dong says.\n\nREAD MORE A love letter to Australia's old school Chinese restaurants\n\nDong says he was touched to learn the meaning behind certain Australian iconography \u2014 such as the kangaroo and emu, which can't easily move backwards \u2014 symbolising a nation moving forward.\n\n\"This kind of shared belief is what brings people together across race, age and background.\"\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with SBS Italian.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

It's got a lot to give and we've got to give back to its development. It's social cohesion.'\n\nFor OAM recipient Trun Dzung Le a sense of belonging began with opportunity.\n\nMoving from Vietnam in 1982, Mr Le said he spent two years in a refugee camp before settling in Melbourne with his family.\n\n\u201cAt that time there were about 10,000 people in that camp. And we were lucky, we had UNHCR they looked after us.\u2019\n\nMr Le went on to found the Hollywood Nails Group, managing nail salons across Victoria which, in turn, helps scores of migrants and refugees through training and employment, providing dignity and stability.\n\nAnd my goal, you know I trying to do something to contribute back to the country Australia. We call Australia home.'\n\nBeyond business, Mr Le's philanthropic reach extends into hospitals, aged-care homes and multicultural organisations.\n\nAlso playing a role in developing the country's first Vietnamese Museum, which aims to preserve refugee stories and celebrate community.\n\nThere's been OAM recognition too in the Top End.\n\nHong-Kong born Dr Felix Ho delivers healthcare to some of Australia's most remote communities.\n\nIn his own time, he shapes the next generation of lifesavers through St John Ambulance.\n\nFrom the age of 13, he's offered a lifetime of service by volunteering for the first aid and emergency response organisation.\n\n\u201cWe have 30 per cent of our population being Indigenous or identify as Indigenous, but they account for about 70 per cent of our hospital and health admissions and sometimes more in other areas. And discrepancies between their chronic diseases, their life expectancy is absolutely staggering. I'm so privileged to be able to work within health to make that small little difference.'\n\nDarwin's Francis Ahmat is known as 'Doodle', attributing that accolade to his family.\n\nThe local AFL and rugby league star also helps lead the Council for Aboriginal Alcohol program services.\n\nMr Ahmat says a friend of his asked him to join as a 'favour'.\n\n\u201c30 years looking after people all the alcohol and all all that, someone said how come you last so long, and I said you don't last long unless you enjoy it.'\n\nFor Melbourne neuropsychologist Dr Judy Tang, born to Chinese-Vietnamese parents, her motivation is to help people feel seen fully and authentically.\n\nThrough leadership roles across government and local organisations, she advocates for multicultural and LGBTIQ+ communities, working to ensure mental health services reflect the diverse identities of the people they support.\n\nMs Tang says an OAM honour recognises all the work that goes into volunteering.\n\n\u201cAs I went on with education and I started noticing gaps around mental health what was missing in terms of servicing and supporting multicultural communities, there was a growing interest to see how we can support and service those gaps.'\n\nIn Australia's country music capital... a legacy celebrated and honoured.\n\nTamworth's Eddie Whitham passed away last year, but his impact is long-lasting.\n\nSince the late 70s, he had supported migrants, refugees and asylum seekers integrating into their new community.\n\nHis advocacy was instrumental in ending the requirement for temporary visa holders to travel to major cities for medical checks.\n\nAnd for her significant service to the community through social policy, and advocating for diversity and inclusion... Tanya Hosch, the first Indigenous person and second woman to join AFL's executive ranks, is now recognised as a Member of the Order of Australia... or AM.\n\nThe AM recipient says greater education is moving treaty conversations forward.\n\n\u201cWe talked about Australia had the first peoples as the oldest living continuous culture on the planet, and I think that's referenced a lot now. And that might be a small thing in itself, but I think it's a significant piece of education that's been absorbed by a lot more Australians. All those conversations are important ones and I think we will always see change even if it takes longer than any of us would like.'\n\nPeople from different walks of life... with a shared ambition of serving their communities.",

Source: SBS News / Phoebe Deas\n\nCalais started volunteering for migrant communities while at university, when he noticed many international students in Hobart struggle to engage with local communities.\n\nHe then established the Overseas Student Service at the University of Tasmania, where he collaborated with social workers to offer support and mentoring to newly arrived students.\n\nHe then took the same idea to Sikh Youth Australia,where he wanted to empower young Sikh people to be \"who they are\".\n\n\"It's an honour to do the service,\" he said. \"For a voluntary organisation working for 26 years where we don't get any income from anyone else except for our own participants, it's been a challenge, but it's been a wonderful journey,\" he said.\n\nDr Felix Ho, who won the Northern Territory Australian of the Year, is a recipient of the Medal of the Order of Australia. Source: SBS News / Josh van Staden\n\nIn the Northern Territory, Hong Kong-born medical practitioner Felix Ho has been awarded the OAM, after being named the Northern Territory (NT) Australian of the Year.\n\nHo is known for his decades-long volunteering for St John Ambulance Australia, where he leads the national youth portfolio to support over 3,000 young people aspiring to be the next generation of first responders.\n\nIn a recent interview with SBS News after receiving the NT Australian of the Year award, he looked back on his upbringing as a migrant.\n\n\"I'm an immigrant, and Australia has accepted me and my family for all its faults,\" he said.\n\n\"Now recent events have highlighted some challenging times, especially for Australia as well as around the world,\" he said, encouraging people to show compassion and learn about their neighbours. \"We are all different, but that's what gives us strength.\"\n\nOrder of Australia council says gender balance 'cause for concern'\n\nWhile offering its congratulations to the 680 Australians included in the 2026 Australia Day Honours list, the Council of the Order of Australia said the fact that only 184 of them were women was \"a cause for concern\".\n\n\"The recipients come from all parts of the country and their service, achievements and impact are remarkable. All are deserving of recognition through our nation's honours system for their service to the Australian community,\" it said in a statement sent to media.\n\n\"However, the gender balance of this year's honours list more broadly is both a cause for concern and, the Council hopes, a prompt for community action.\"\n\nIt pointed out that OA honours were the result of public nominations, and this had led to a \"significantly larger pool of nominations for men\" eligible for consideration.\n\n\"Many more nominations are still being received for men than women and the Council must consider the nominations for Australians that are in the system,\" it said.\n\n\"There is no doubt there are as many outstanding women contributing to our communities as there are men,\" the council said, adding that the equal number of men and women appointed Companions of the Order this year was a reflection of that.\n\nThe council urged Australians to nominate more women for the list, saying that the online nomination process was simple and help was available to navigate it.\n\n\"We encourage all Australians to look around their community, their workplaces, and the whole of our society, identify the women, as well as the men, who make a difference and whose impact is profound and nominate them so they can be celebrated through the Order of Australia.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

Rather, they are driven by outcomes which benefit others,\" he said in a statement provided to the media.\n\nRead more about all four winners below.\n\nAustralian of the Year: Katherine Bennell-Pegg\n\nFrom an early age, Bennell-Pegg says she dreamed of becoming an astronaut.\n\n\"When we had our careers counselling, they said, write down three different things you want to be. I wrote down one: astronaut,\" she said in a recent interview.\n\nIn 2024, she completed basic astronaut training as one of six graduates trained by the European Astronaut Centre in Germany, becoming the first international participant to achieve this distinction.\n\nShe was selected from more than 22,500 applicants worldwide.\n\nNow 41 years old, Bennell-Pegg is working as a space engineer and has contributed to the development of numerous space missions and innovative technologies.\n\nFor her, space is not about escaping the Earth, but helping to see it more clearly.\n\n\"Space is a high point in the sky from which we can see bushfires and floods and phenomena across our country. It's how we look after our first responders by connecting them in remote regions. It's how we guide our farmers' farming equipment, how we ensure our national security, and how we unlock discoveries that can only be unlocked in space,\" she said.\n\n\"It's 'pinch me' stuff to be in this position, and I hope by being here and showing what's possible, I can unlock that path for more to follow in the future. When I grew up, I was mesmerised by the tars above me, but they felt very far away.

Individuals living with dementia, along with their carers, received minimal support and had few options for care or guidance.\n\nREAD MORE More than a million Australians could be living with dementia in 40 years. These are possible risk factors\n\nHis father's experience sparked a lifelong commitment to improve the lives of people affected by dementia and their families.\n\nIn 2012, Brodaty co-founded UNSW's Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing, from which he's spearheaded internationally renowned research that has advanced global understanding of dementia risk and prevention.\n\nAt Sunday's event, Brodaty dedicated his win \"to all of us who are older, and all of us who hopefully will get older, and especially to those affected by dementia and their families.\" He also mentioned his father, who he said had died with dementia aged 59, and his mother, who was his father's carer in those years.\n\nHe also reiterated previous calls for Australia to implement a 'slip, slop, slap' type campaign for brain health.\n\nLISTEN TO \"We need the slip, slop, slap of brain health - now\": Advocates call for new national approach to dementia SBS News 06:31 English\n\n\"This needs to be a whole-of-life approach. The earlier we start, the better. So, is there hope for dementia? You bet.\"\n\nFraser said Brodaty has \"turned his personal experience into a lifelong commitment to improving outcomes for people living with dementia\".\n\n\"His work will benefit not just those affected today, but all of us in the future,\" Fraser said.\n\nDementia has recently overtaken heart disease to become Australia's leading cause of death, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics data released in November.\n\nYoung Australian of the Year: Nedd Brockmann\n\nIn 2022, 23-year-old electrician Ned Brockmann made international headlines by running from Perth to Sydney in 46 days \u2014 and raising over $2.6 million for people experiencing homelessness in the process.\n\nBrockmann's awareness of homelessness grew during his weekly trips to TAFE, where he regularly saw people sleeping rough along Sydney's Eddy Avenue.\n\nDetermined to draw attention to homelessness, the marathon runner decided to take action.\n\nHis 3,952km run from Perth's Cottlesloe Beach to Sydney's Bondi Beach didn't only raise millions for charity but also set an Australian record (although one that has since been broken).\n\nNedd Brockmann raised over $2.6 million from over 37,000 individual contributors to his Australian-record-breaking run from Perth to Sydney in 2022. Source: AAP / Steven Saphore\n\nIn 2024, he launched Nedd's Uncomfortable Challenge, a charity campaign through which participants choose their own \"uncomfortable\" physical or mental challenge to raise funds for those sleeping rough.\n\nTogether with his team, Brockmann has since raised more than $8 million for the cause.\n\nUpon receiving the award on Sunday, Brockmann, now 27-years-old, said: \"In a country as prosperous as Australia, why is it that 122,000 Australians sleep rough every night? That number should stop us all in our tracks.\"\n\nFraser said that Brockmann had \"chose[n] not to look away\" from the scale of Australia's homelessness crisis.\n\n\"Instead, he took action, and he hasn't stopped since,\" Fraser said.\n\n\"He continues to run for change, finding new ways to help end homelessness, and engaging others to join the fight along the way.\"\n\nAustralia's Local Hero for 2026: Frank Mitchell\n\nFrank Mitchell has been recognised for his efforts to create opportunities for Aboriginal Australians in the trades and construction industry.\n\nThe 43-year-old Whadjuk-Yued Noongar man has said that, as a young single father, being offered an electrical apprenticeship was a profound opportunity.\n\n\"Having lost two friends to drugs and suicide in my teenage years, I was in a bit of a death spiral when I was in my early 20s, and two things happened over the course of the next five years that really I can look back on and attest to my life's outcomes turning around,\" he said recently.\n\nHe said one was the unplanned birth of his son when he was at the age of 21, which \"really shook me to my core about recognising that I had to provide for this beautiful boy\".\n\nThe second was the opportunity to do an electrical apprenticeship.\n\n\"I really wasn't feeling confident that I could achieve an electrical apprenticeship trade, but this one man believed in me, that was my uncle,\" he said, adding that the experience had instilled in him a desire to \"pay that forward\".\n\nSo, when he became a business owner in 2015, he set about creating such opportunities for other Aboriginal Australians.\n\nMitchell and his business partners have now created over 70 Aboriginal upskilling positionsand awarded over $11 million to Aboriginal subcontractors.\n\n\"For some people, opportunity and belief might be enough. For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, it's more complex than that,\" Mitchell said in his acceptance speech on Sunday night.\n\n\"We're constantly navigating racism, stereotypes, and the ongoing impacts of colonisation. I used to advocate for organisations to simply give Mob a job. But I know now, opportunity alone is not enough.\"\n\nFraser said Mitchel's \"approach to building an industry-led community that combines training, employment and culture is delivering stronger futures for people who need them most and demonstrates what can be achieved through collaboration and social inclusion,\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "More than 100 years ago, the typical Australian was a 24-year-old male. Today, it's a 38-year-old woman.\n\nThat statistic captures just one of the ways the country has changed since the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) began conducting its Census surveys in 1911.\n\nThe first survey \u2014 which took place more than 100 years after the First Fleet arrived in 1788 \u2014 counted 4.4 million people in Australia. That number didn't include Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander communities.\n\nOnly \"full-blooded Australian Aboriginals\" in the employ of white settlers or those living in the vicinity of settlements were recorded, and in 1911, there 19,939 were counted \u2014 11,385 of which, were men.\n\nThe 'average' Australia is a 38-year-old woman who was born in Australia and speaks English at home. Source: SBS News\n\nThe picture remained largely incomplete until a full count of First Nations people was mandated in the 1967 referendum. The most recent Census in 2021 tells us that 3.2 per cent of Australia's total population of 25 million people identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander \u2014 approximately 812,000 residents.\n\nAustralia's population has also ballooned since that first Census, and as of June 2024, is now estimated to be 27 million.\n\nREAD MORE What does it mean to be Australian? We asked these migrant Australians\n\nSo, on the eve of January 26, SBS News wanted to ask: who are we, really?\n\nLet's find out.\n\nWe were born in Australia and live in major cities\n\nAlmost 70 per cent of residents were born in Australia, according to Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) estimates from June 2023.\n\nTasmania has the highest Australian-born population (79 per cent), while Victoria has the lowest (65 per cent).\n\nThe overwhelming majority of Australians live in major cities \u2014 making up 73 per cent of the population.\n\nA quarter live in inner regional and outer regional areas, while the remaining 1.9 per cent live in remote and very remote areas.\n\nThree-bedroom homes are the most common form of housing, according to the 2021 Census, with 37 per cent of Australians living in a three-bedroom property. However, those in Western Australia are more likely to live in a four-bedroom home, with 37 per cent doing so.\n\nWe're married and have more than one child\n\nA couple with children is still the most common family composition in Australia, representing almost 30 per cent of residents, according to Census data from 2021.\n\nThis trend is consistent across most jurisdictions, except South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, where couples with no children are more common.\n\nMost families have at least two or more children in Australia. Source: SBS News\n\nThe average number of children per family in Australia is 1.8, and 58 per cent of families have two or more children in the household.\n\nAround a third of Australians are married, and this is the most common marital status response everywhere except the NT, where \"not married\" is the most common answer (29 per cent).\n\nWe earn around $1,436 per week\n\nThe median wage for Australians is $1,436 a week ($74,672 a year) before tax, so if you earn more than this, your income is higher than half of all working Australians.\n\nIf you're working full-time, the median is higher, rising to $1,887 a week before tax ($98,124 a year), according to the latest ABS employee earnings release published on Friday.\n\nThe median for men is even higher \u2014 $1,994 a week \u2014 which equates to $103,688 a year. For women working full-time, it is $1,758 a week ($91,416 a year).\n\nWe're a nation of migrants\n\nAustralians are slightly more likely to have at least one parent born overseas (48 per cent), than for both parents to be born in Australia (46 per cent).\n\nBut the picture can vary widely depending on which state you live in.\n\nAlmost half of all Australians have at least one parent born overseas.\n\nIn Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania and the NT, residents are more likely to have both parents born in Australia.\n\nNotably, 67 per cent of Tasmanians report both parents were born in Australia.\n\nBut in other states, you are slightly more likely to have at least one parent born overseas. In Western Australia, 56 per cent of residents had at least one overseas-born parent.\n\nBut we mostly speak English at home\n\nAround 72 per cent of residents speak English at home, nationally \u2014 this increases to 86 per cent in Tasmania.\n\nThe second most common language is Mandarin, with 2.7 per cent speaking it at home. It holds this rank in every jurisdiction except the NT, where Kriol is the second most common language. The NT also has the highest proportion of people who speak a language other than English (32 per cent).\n\nThe most common ancestry in Australia is also English (32 per cent), which remains the top response in all jurisdictions, except the NT, where 24 per cent are Australian Aboriginal.\n\nMost Australians speak English at home. Source: Getty / Maskot/Maskot\n\nMigrants are also commonly from England\n\nFor those not born in Australia, the most common birthplace is England, with 4 per cent being of English origin.\n\nBut this varies widely depending on the state or territory.\n\nIn NSW, migrants were most commonly born in China (3 per cent); in Victoria and ACT, India was the most common birthplace (around 4 per cent); in Queensland, New Zealand (4 per cent); and in the NT, it was the Philippines (3 per cent).\n\nREAD MORE How multicultural is your suburb?\n\nWe're slaves to our mortgages\n\nThe most common housing tenure type \u2014 which describes whether a property is owned or rented \u2014 in Australia is a home owned with a mortgage. Nearly a third of Australians (30 per cent) are in this situation.\n\nBut the picture changes if you live in NSW and the NT, where it's more common to rent (28.5 per cent of people rent in NSW, and 37.5 per cent in the NT).\n\nIt's a completely different story in Tasmania, where it's more common for people to own their homes outright, with 32 per cent doing so.\n\nTwenty years ago, it was most common for Australians to own their home outright (that is, without a mortgage), with 30 per cent doing so in 2006. But by 2011, this changed to owning a home with a mortgage (30 per cent ).\n\nIn NSW, the shift has been even more stark, with renting now the most common response (29 per cent).\n\nRenting was the most common housing tenure in NSW in 2021, according to ABS Census data, but in 2006 people were more likely to own their home outright. Source: SBS News\n\nWe own two cars\n\nThe typical Australian owns two cars, with 34 per cent having access to two vehicles.\n\nBut in NSW and the NT, it is more common to own just one car (35 per cent in NSW and 32 per cent in NT).\n\nWe're getting older, and more of us are female\n\nThe median age in Australia is 38, but some jurisdictions skew older or younger. In Tasmania, the median is 42, while in the NT, it's 33.\n\nAustralians are getting older. In 2001 the median age was 35.7, and in 1911, the median age was 24.\n\nTasmania has a higher proportion of older residents, while the Northern Territory has a higher proportion of younger residents, than other areas of Australia. Source: SBS News\n\nWe are also slightly more likely to be female, with 51 per cent of the population identifying as such.\n\nThis holds true for every state and territory except the NT, where 50.5 per cent are male.\n\nMore than half of all men aged 15 and over do some housework each week \u2014 56 per cent perform up to 14 hours of unpaid domestic duties \u2014 but 27 per cent did none.\n\nAround 25 per cent of women did no housework, but 46.15 per cent reported completing between five and 29 hours of unpaid domestic duties in one week.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

What type of physical shape do you hope to be in? And what are the activities you want to be able to continue doing? While there\u2019s no crystal ball to predict your future health, there are a few basic tests you can give yourself to gauge your current strength, power, cardiovascular fitness and balance \u2014 all of which will influence your physical abilities going forward. These kinds of tests have been associated with longevity and independent living. They\u2019re also proxies for activities that many people want to be able to do in old age, like getting down on the floor to play with grandchildren or travelling and exploring a new city by foot. These 4 basic tests give you a great indication of how you\u2019re ageing. Getty Images It\u2019s never too early to begin training for your later years, said Stuart Phillips, a professor of kinesiology at McMaster University in Ontario. People naturally lose strength and muscle mass with age, so you want your starting point to be as good as possible. Getting a head start on training is \u201cmoney in the bank,\u201d Phillips said. It\u2019s also never too late to improve your physical abilities, he added: \u201cWe\u2019ve got data showing that nonagenarians, so people in their 10th decade of life, or in their 90s, can make gains in strength and function with just a little bit of even light activity.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTry these four tests to determine where you currently stand. If you don\u2019t perform as well as you might have hoped, don\u2019t worry: A few strength, conditioning and balance exercises, done regularly, can help you improve your score on each one. Editor's pick Fitness The goal posts for a longer, healthier life are closer than you think 1. Sitting-Rising Test The goal with this assessment is to go from standing to sitting on the floor, and back up again, using the least amount of support as possible. The test is scored on a 10-point scale \u2014 five points for sitting down and five points for standing up \u2014 and you lose a point for every hand, knee or other body part you use to help yourself. Subtract a half point if you\u2019re unsteady or lose your balance. Adults in their 30s and 40s should aim for a perfect 10, said Dr. Claudio Gil Ara\u00fajo, the dean of research and education at the Exercise Medicine Clinic in Brazil, who developed the test. Anyone over 60 who gets an 8 is \u201cin very good shape,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe test evaluates strength, power, balance and flexibility. Ara\u00fajo has also shown it\u2019s a predictor of mortality. A recent study of his looked at more than 4,000 adults age 46 to 75 and found that, over the course of 12 years, the people who scored 4 or below on the sitting-rising test had death rates nearly four times higher than those who scored a 10. He said that was primarily because people with low scores were at a higher risk for falls. 2. Walking speed assessment How fast someone walks at their normal gait is \u201ca very important indicator of functional ability and vitality,\u201d said Jennifer Brach, a professor of health and rehabilitation sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cIt is predictive of future decline; it\u2019s predictive of mortality, nursing home placement, disability, a whole host of different things,\u201d she said. To assess your walking speed, measure out 4 meters, or about 13 feet, on a straight, flat surface, and time how long it takes you to cover the distance. (Remember, you\u2019re walking at your normal speed, not as fast as you can.) People of all ages should aim for a gait of at least 1.2 meters per second, a little over three seconds total. Brach recommended people retest themselves every few months. \u201cIf the value changes, that can be a warning sign,\u201d she said. That\u2019s because while walking feels like a simple task, it requires proper functioning of the cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, vestibular (balance), sensory and nervous systems. A slower gait could indicate that there\u2019s a problem in any one of those systems that may need to be investigated and addressed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Grip strength test Related Article Nutrition Can we call butter and beef tallow \u2018healthy fats\u2019? Grip strength is also related to mortality. While that connection may seem far-fetched, experts say a grip strength test serves as a helpful indicator for how active a person is in their daily life. \u201cWhen you\u2019re using your hands more, it\u2019s probably because you\u2019re doing things more,\u201d said Cathy Ciolek, president of the American Physical Therapy Association Geriatrics. \u201cYou\u2019re carrying groceries, you\u2019re opening the car door, you\u2019re picking up a grandchild.\u201d All of those things work your hands, she said, and the more you do them, the better your grip strength. Grip strength is also important for maintaining independence with household tasks like cooking. (Think about pulling a heavy dish out of the oven.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA doctor or physical therapist typically assesses grip strength using a special device called a dynamometer. To test yourself at home, try walking for 60 seconds while holding a heavy weight in each hand (also known as a farmer\u2019s carry), suggested Dr. Nima Afshar, a physician at concierge medical practice Private Medical. Start with lighter weights and work your way up to heavier ones over time. If you experience hand or body pain, stop. There aren\u2019t age-related norms for the farmer\u2019s carry like there are with a dynamometer. But Afshar said a 45-year-old man should aim to carry two 60-pound dumbbells, a 65-year-old two 40-pound dumbbells and an 85-year-old two 25-pounders. For a woman at those ages, goal weights are 40 pounds, 25 pounds and 15 pounds in each hand. 4. Single-leg stand Just as strength naturally declines with age, so does balance. And that raises the risk for falls \u2014 a major cause of injury and death in older adults. Testing one\u2019s balance is as simple as standing on one leg. Adults should aim for a minimum of 10 seconds on at least one side. For an added challenge, Afshar recommended attempting the test with your eyes closed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a study Ara\u00fajo published in 2022, 20% of adults age 51 to 75 were unable to make it to 10 seconds. And those individuals had an 84% higher chance of dying in the next seven years, possibly because they were unhealthier at the start of the study. \u201cYou can\u2019t predict an individual\u2019s precise mortality\u201d with these types of tests, Afshar said. But if you\u2019re below average on any of them, it\u2019s likely you won\u2019t fare as well long term. That said, he added, all of these metrics \u2014 strength, fitness, balance \u2014 can be improved, and as you improve, your risk of dying soon goes down.

        "text": "Resilience is something Stajcic has always tried to teach his players \u2013 and there have been many over two and a half decades. From his national teams (Matildas, Young Matildas, Philippines) and clubs (Sydney FC Women, Central Coast Mariners Men, Perth Glory Men, Wanderers Men) and, right at the start, the NSWIS Women\u2019s Football Program, through which he nurtured the Matildas\u2019 golden generation. Resilience is also a muscle he has been forced to flex during some low periods so severe \u2013 namely his Matildas sacking and all the erroneous innuendo accompanying it \u2013 it\u2019s perplexing to the outsider he did not give coaching away completely and start fresh as a landscaper or diving instructor, or literally anything else unrelated to football. Loading \u201cI don\u2019t know, I just love the game,\u201d he reasons. \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing I can thank my parents for, and especially my father, who sacrificed everything for me to play the game and follow my dreams within the game. They came to Australia as immigrants from Yugoslavia without a word of English or a cent to their names, and gave me and my brother everything they could. Football was one of the things that they gave us. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky that this country gives you the opportunity to go through the ranks. As a first-generation Australian, to be able to go from immigrant parents without a cent to their name to coaching a country is pretty special. And little things like being the first Australian-born coach to win a game at a World Cup \u2013 and having three wins now at a World Cup \u2013 make it special, and more recognition for the sacrifice everyone put in for you to be able to follow your dreams.\n\n\u201cSo this is probably more recognition for my family than for me. My mother and father, and my wife and my kids, who have sacrificed the most out of everyone.\u201d Careful, because this is not a eulogy. Stajcic is only 52 and still very much a coach, albeit one out of work (\u201cJust hanging in there,\u201d he laughs). But the past is what earned him this rare honour, bestowed on only a handful of Australian coaches. Matildas players listen to direction from Stajcic in 2018. Credit: Getty Images \u201cEspecially in women\u2019s football,\u201d he says. \u201cI started off on the journey when everyone thought it was uncool \u2013 the poor cousin of the poor cousin. Being disregarded and discriminated against, and not thought of or cared about by pretty much everyone in administration. I was warned off going down that field, but it didn\u2019t bother me really. I just loved the game, and anyone who loved the game I was happy to share my time with. \u201cTo think of the things we had to go through at the NSW Institute of Sport, just to get a training field and gear and women\u2019s-sized clothing, and revenues and resources for the team. It was a pretty amazing ride. And to think about the talent ID \u2013 of finding those players from all around NSW and Australia, and how the group sort of grew up together and has become the golden generation. That probably gives me the greatest joy and pride, to see how we all evolved together as coaches and players, and went from virtually nothing to \u2013 for me \u2013 becoming probably the best team in the world.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, the Matildas reached a record high FIFA ranking of No.4, behind No.3 England, No.2 Germany, and long-time leaders the United States. It was in July of that year that Australia first beat the US \u2013 a major milestone in Seattle after 26 fruitless attempts. Sam Kerr, Steph Catley and their contemporaries of 2023 World Cup fame were in the early 20s. With retired Matildas goalkeeper Lydia Williams. They almost repeated that 1-0 Tournament of Nations triumph at the 2018 edition (during which a 15-year-old Mary Fowler made her senior international debut against Brazil) but for an injury-time equaliser in Connecticut. Still, Megan Rapinoe shook Stajcic\u2019s hand after that game and, in a casual chat, gave her former Sydney FC coach the impression that her all-conquering US team were wary of Australia leading into the 2019 World Cup. This evidence, on the back of finishing runners-up at April\u2019s Asian Cup in Jordan, was enough for Stajcic to believe his Matildas were genuine World Cup contenders. Seven months later he was at the centre of one of the most controversial dismissals in Australian football history. \u201cIt hurt my soul,\u201d he remembers. Then he repeats it. \u201cIt hurt my soul.\u201d\n\nThe personal trauma was compounded, he says, by the knowledge he\u2019d been offered the highly lucrative England head coaching job (China came knocking too), but turned it down. \u201cFor four or five times the money, all the resources, they told me they were going to host the [2022] Euros, everything,\u201d he says. \u201cI knocked it back and then Phil Neville took it after me. I wanted to stay with Australia for the [2019] World Cup \u2026 and 12 months later I got sacked. I always said I\u2019m not going to be that loyal ever again, but then I do it again. And again.\u201d Alen Stajcic\u2019s magic touch set up the Central Coast Mariners for success. Credit: Getty Images Perhaps such loyalty is part of the reason he is now an OAM? \u201cNot sure, to be honest,\u201d is his answer, but he does know he possessed a \u201cwillingness to fight and fight back\u201d. Three months later he was hired as Central Coast\u2019s caretaker coach, then permanent coach, and in early 2021 oversaw the Mariners\u2019 first back-to-back A-League Men wins since December 2017. The competition\u2019s laughing stock had transformed into table-toppers. Western United\u2019s coach at the time, Mark Rudan, called him \u201ca magician, as far as I\u2019m concerned\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic,\u201d Stajcic said pragmatically. \u201cThe magic is hard work.\u201d\n\nIn late 2021, when was appointed head coach of the Philippines \u2013 he went on to qualify the nation for its first Women\u2019s World Cup and they made their debut in the 2023 tournament with a win over co-hosts New Zealand \u2013 and handed the reins to assistant and club great Nick Montgomery, the foundations were laid for back-to-back championships, a premiership and an AFC Cup. \u201cNow six or seven of those guys have played [for the] Socceroos \u2013 from a team that, when I took over in 2019, had won one game out of 21 \u2013 and are now in contention for this next World Cup,\u201d Stajcic says. Stajcic with his Philippines coaching staff. Credit: Reuters \u201cThat was a really massive highlight for me \u2013 knowing I could do it in men\u2019s football as well and achieve so much. It was an unknown really. I had coached elite boys from 12 to 18 for 10 years as well. But coaching a professional men\u2019s team? That was something that I had to learn. \u201cBut the longer I went on the more I realised, especially as society as well has evolved, I think the genders have come closer together. And especially the younger generation who\u2019ve grown up with phones and social media and all those kinds of things. So the problems they face and the dilemmas they have are more closely aligned with each other.\u201d",

At its peak, the temperature would be up to 8 degrees above average \u2013 at 36 to 37 degrees \u2013 in Brisbane, the Bureau of Meteorology\u2019s Shane Kennedy said.

Brittney Deguara/Brisbane Times Residents in Ipswich were facing up to 39 degrees, while further west the temperature was expected to exceed 40 degrees. \u201cIt could be a pretty warm night still, but tomorrow we\u2019ll have a southeasterly wind change,\u201d Kennedy said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[We\u2019re] expecting that it\u2019ll drop the afternoon temperatures back down to the low 30s, so close to average, and it should stay around those low 30s for the rest of the week.\u201d Heatwave conditions were expected further inland for the rest of the week, with temperatures of 11 to 12 degrees above average expected through the week.

That\u2019ll be a big blessing if we get some storms later [on Monday]. \u201cIt\u2019s good for the temperatures, but potential to do a little bit of wind damage.\u201d About 220,000 lightning strikes were recorded across the state\u2019s south-east during storms on Sunday evening. Strikes on the power network contributed to about 13,600 homes and businesses losing power, with 450 customers affected at 8am on Monday. By 11am, this had reduced to just 66 customers, in Ashgrove and Hendra. No heat-related outages have been reported.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStaff at Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary were working hard to ensure animals were kept cool in the heat. \u201cDuring hot days, dingoes and Tasmanian devils can walk through or lie down in their ponds to cool off,\u201d said Rebecca Bain, the head of mammals at Lone Pine.

They can then lick the water off themselves and nearby branches if in need of a drink.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLone Pine is open on Australia Day, though visitors are unlikely to see the wombats. \u201cThey tend to retreat underground in burrows during warm days \u2013 it is up to several degrees cooler down there,\u201d Bain said.

        "text": "Key politicians have weighed into the debate over Sussan Ley\u2019s future as Liberal leader as speculation of a spill intensifies following the splintering of the Coalition.\n\nThe Opposition Leader has come under intense scrutiny after 11 National Party members resigned from her front bench last week, citing the \u201cuntenable\u201d nature of the historic Liberals-Nationals alliance under Ms Ley\u2019s leadership as the reason for their exit.\n\nThe Coalition split is the second since Ms Ley was elected to the top job in May last year and has raised questions surrounding her ability to survive as leader.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLiberal MPs Angus Taylor and Andrew Hastie are widely considered the main contenders in any bid to roll Ms Ley and are understood to be canvassing support for a challenge.\n\nQuestions are swirling around Sussan Ley\u2019s ability to last as leader. Picture: Gaye Gerard /NewsWire\n\nMr Hastie has received the endorsement of his young family to pursue a leadership ticket, The Australian reports, while Mr Taylor has returned from a Europe trip early amid the unfolding leadership crisis.\n\nSpeaking to Seven\u2019s Sunrise on Monday, former Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce \u2013 who served as deputy prime minister under two Coalition governments \u2013 claimed reports of the pair duking it out for the leadership ticket were \u201cprobably right\u201d.\n\nWhen asked who would take the top spot, Mr Joyce backed Mr Hastie, saying the conservative MP has \u201cgot the numbers\u201d to emerge as the winner of a party room revolt.\n\nLiberal leadership aspirant Andrew Hastie previously quit Ms Ley\u2019s shadow cabinet. Picture: NewsWire/Philip Gostelow\n\nAngus Taylor lost the leadership ballot to Ms Ley in May. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nBut deputy Liberal leader Ted O\u2019Brien claimed there wouldn\u2019t be spill motion against Ms Ley, describing media reports as being \u201cvery much overstated\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t received calls of canvassing. I haven\u2019t had colleagues ringing me saying there\u2019s a whole bunch of people canvassing,\u201d he said.\n\nSituations like the Coalition split often triggered \u201ca whole bunch of discussions about other possibilities and leadership is one of those things\u201d, he added.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe there will be any change. I think what we\u2019ve seen is Sussan Ley displaying an enormous amount of dignity and strength over recent times, and that is recognised by my colleagues. And so I don\u2019t believe there will be a challenge.\u201d\n\nHis comments were echoed by Liberal backbencher Jane Hume who told Sky News: \u201cThere has been no spill call. There has been no demand for action here. Sussan Ley is the leader.\u201d\n\nDespite being asked about Ms Ley\u2019s survival as leader two more times, Senator Hume maintained any commentary around a spill was based on a \u201chypothetical\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cNo one has called for a spill, and a spill can\u2019t happen until there is a party room. We haven\u2019t got a party room for a number of days. There is no call for a spill until that happens,\u201d she said.\n\nJane Hume was adamant no one in the party had called for a spill. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\n\u201cWhat we need to do is focus on the job to hand, which is holding the government to account and uniting the Liberal Party as the opposition now that the coalition is no longer (together).\u201d\n\nEarlier, Mr Taylor and Mr Hastie\u2019s treatment of Ms Ley was described as unfair by Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek, who claimed the pair had not given the Liberal leader a \u201cfair go\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been out together since day one. I don\u2019t think Angus Taylor ever got over not winning the leadership in the first place,\u201d she said, referencing Mr Taylor\u2019s loss of the leadership ballot to Ms Ley in May last year.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cAnd Andrew Hastie, he\u2019s been nipping at her heels the whole way through. So it\u2019s been, all in all, a pretty unedifying thing to watch.\u201d\n\nReporters also asked Anthony Albanese about the Liberal leadership spill rumours on the sidelines of the national citizenship ceremony in Canberra.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on national unity and on the national interest,\u201d the Prime Minister said.\n\n\u201cThe Liberals and the Nationals seem to be focused on themselves, and I think they\u2019ll be marked down for it.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is real indulgence from what used to be called the Coalition, but from people who simply don\u2019t like each other.\n\n\u201cAnd if you can\u2019t govern yourselves, I don\u2019t see how you can be an alternative government of the country.\u201d",

        "text": "Another Aussie council is facing pressure to ban the use of synthetic turf along nature strips and in new homes.\n\nThe City of Swan in Western Australia is being called upon to follow other Perth suburbs in restricting artificial grass to protect public health and the environment, as the city grapples with a tree canopy crisis.\n\nAcross the country, turf is fast becoming a flashpoint between councils and residents. As homeowners turn to synthetic lawns for their low-maintenance appeal, local governments are pushing back \u2014 citing environmental, safety, and heat concerns.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nResident Catherine Dixon said fake lawns are not only ugly, but also contribute to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, which drives up temperatures in Perth's already sweltering suburbs.\n\n\u201cSynthetic turf has been documented to reach temperatures over double or triple the air temperature,\u201d she told The Echo, adding the material is \"significantly hotter\" than natural grass and can put people at risk of burns.\n\nShe is calling for their complete ban and encourages residents to switch to natural grass, plants and trees.\n\n\u201cThe trend in new developments installing fake grass is not helping our heat island or tree canopy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks ugly, weeds still grow, it fades in colour, it doesn\u2019t hold its shape, and it smells.\"\n\nPerth city is grappling with a declining tree canopy. Source: Getty\n\nCity of Swan Mayor Tanya Richardson confirmed the council strongly discourages the use of fake turf, and those who wish to use it require permission from the city.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWhile the City of Swan does not currently ban the use of synthetic turf on verges, it is discouraged,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWaterwise verges with native plants and mulch increase water efficiency and stormwater infiltration, creating a cooling effect, and provide habitat for local wildlife,\" she said.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the greening of verges can be beneficial for human health and wellbeing, improving aesthetics and saving money.\"\n\nPerth's tree canopy crisis amid property development\n\nPerth city has been grappling with a tree canopy crisis as rapid, high-density development infills the city and an invasive pest decimates mature trees.\n\nAccording to Trillion Trees Australia, data shows Perth has the smallest tree canopy of all the Australian cities.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nLast year, authorities went as far as to offer a financial incentive to encourage residents to plant more trees.\n\nPlastics group calls for five-year ban on sports fields\n\nEarlier this month, a plastics research group called for a five-year ban on new synthetic sporting fields.\n\nThey are shedding enormous amounts of waste across suburbs, and creating a threat to human health.\n\nThe call for the moratorium was prompted by a seven-year study by the Australian Microplastic Assessment Project (AUSMAP), which found microplastics and rubber crumb waste are particularly problematic around coastal areas.\n\nThe group\u2019s research director, Dr Scott Wilson, described fake grass as \u201cinsidious\u201d and warned that very little is known about the scale of the problems it unleashes.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
