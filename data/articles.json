(Nick Moir)\n\nOne serious incident occurred in Victoria in 2016 , when 10 people died after ambulance and emergency services were overwhelmed with the number of people suffering from asthma symptoms after a thunderstorm.\n\nHealth experts say all Australians need to be aware of the risks thunderstorm asthma poses.\n\n\"Events like thunderstorm asthma can affect people who have never experienced asthma symptoms before,\" Dr Tony MacDermott said.\n\n\"These individuals are less likely to have medication on hand, so it helps to know what medical resources are available to you before an incident strikes, to keep you safe and potentially out of hospital.\"\n\nThose with asthma and who suffer from conditions like hayfever are being told to be proactive this srping. (Nine)\n\nPeople who are allergic to grass pollen and hayfever sufferers are at higher risk of suffering from thunderstorm asthma.\n\nMacDermott urged Australians with these conditions or who suffer from asthma to be vigilant and proactive in looking after their health this spring.\n\n\"[We] see increased levels of distress amongst asthmatics during spring which highlights the fact that having a proactive conversation with your doctor can be the best medicine when it comes to seasonal health issues,\" he said.\n\n\"When it comes to asthma or any chronic health condition, the most important thing to have is a plan and the support you need to mitigate any risks and get the right care at the right time.\"",

(Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nOf course, even with age, some things never change.\n\nThe man whose every hiccough has been public property for more than 40 years is happy to share his battles with the pain of ageing.\n\n\"Originally, I thought I didn't ever want to go into a nursing home,\" Hinch told me.\n\n\"But I'm told now by some of the nursing homes I've been talking to that you can still socialise there and it's not like you are locked away.\"\n\nAnd death?\n\nHe's had liver cancer, a liver transplant, facial melanoma that required significant radiation treatment, a life-threatening blood infection, and recently cardiac arrhythmia, where the heart doesn't beat properly and is effectively stopped and restarted to get back into rhythm.\n\n\"I'm very lucky that my brain still seems to be going,\" he said.\n\n\"Some people will dispute that, but it seems to be.\n\n\"But if my brain went, I've told my medical attorney not to revive me.\"\n\nAnd would he consider voluntary assisted dying?\n\n\"Yes, I would. Yes. One of my best friends, Bob Rogers, did have his life taken by voluntary assisted dying because he had no quality of life.\n\n\"He couldn't go to the toilet by himself. He couldn't shower. He couldn't dress himself.\n\n\"And the last time I took him out to lunch I had to get on my hands and knees to lift his feet into a taxi.\n\n\"I thought, 'This is not living.'\"\n\nRogers, who was 97, died in May last year.\n\nHe was a broadcasting icon for over 78 years.\n\nHinch, who was described as a spokesman for the Rogers family after the death, once offered to fly with Rogers to a Zurich euthanasia clinic and \"be with him while he went\".\n\nBut the family did not agree.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Huge snowfalls push ski season into spring\n\nLate radio icon Bob Rogers. (Nine Entertainment)\n\nHinch himself has been close to death at least twice.\n\nHis liver transplant was 14 years ago and was, he says, a \"punt\".\n\nThe donor liver came from a drug addict and may have carried dangerous infections.\n\nIt later emerged that without the surgery, Hinch would have been dead in two weeks.\n\nBut he remains a committed atheist, not having a \"bob each way\" as the inevitable approaches.\n\n\"When you're dead, you're dead. I don't believe in heaven and I get uncomfortable when people say, 'Oh, he will meet so and so upstairs.'\n\n\"I find that pretty embarrassing.\n\n\"I stopped taking communion when I was about 12 and told my parents I didn't believe it anymore. I have no belief at all.\"\n\nExcept, perhaps, self-belief.\n\nHis mind remains sharp and the strong self-belief hasn't faded.\n\nHe has no self-doubt.\n\nBooze has been a constant in the Hinch life.\n\nLunches were marathons and he once wrote a newspaper column claiming to drink four bottles of white wine every day.\n\nThat's eight times the recommended daily intake, and exactly why he ended with cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nHe reluctantly agrees he \"thinks\" he was an alcoholic and says he stopped drinking for eight years out of respect for the donor of his liver.\n\nHe now drinks occasionally, he says.\n\nSo why the broken promise?\n\n\"It's partly because I've only got a few years left. I want to live well. But partly because my donor was a drug addict.\n\n\"I think I've made a deal with him.\"\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Friend of accused gunman says he could have network of supporters helping him\n\nDerryn Hinch has been imprisoned three times.

You stand by things you've done. You don't really see many mistakes in your life. Do you think you're arrogant?\n\nHINCH: That's for you to decide.\n\nMITCHELL: That's a political answer. You're back in the bloody Senate. What do you think?\n\nHINCH: I don't think it's arrogant. I think it's just confidence.\n\nMITCHELL: What's the difference?\n\nHINCH: Donald Trump is arrogant. I'm self-confident.",

(Edwina Pickles)\n\nThe changes would be budget-neutral \u2013 that is, not increase or decrease the amount of tax revenue collected by the government \u2013 and the boost to households would come from collecting $91 billion in ways that do less harm to the economy.\n\nMurphy also modelled that it would lead to an increase in real wages, while at the same time improving real GDP by 6 per cent.\n\n\"At the (productivity) roundtable, the federal treasurer committed to 'a better tax system',\" he wrote.\n\n\"In that spirit, this paper models reform packages for Australian property, corporate and household taxes to increase consumer welfare by shifting towards more efficient taxes.\"\n\nThe first package includes removing stamp duty and land taxes on investment properties, and replacing them by effectively expanding council rates into a broad-based land tax.\n\nChris Murphy's proposal would see the GST broadened to include items that are currently exempt, like fresh food. (Louise Kennerley/AFR)\n\nMurphy said that change alone accounts for $27 billion of the $43 billion benefit households would enjoy.\n\nHe also proposed reducing corporate tax for most companies, while at the same time increasing the tax bill for ultra-profitable entities in uncompetitive, oligopolistic sectors like banking and supermarkets, as well as reducing the concessions related to franking credits.\n\nAnd on taxes that more directly affect households, Murphy said the government would do well to expand the GST to remove the current exemptions provided to goods and services like fresh food and private education.\n\nHe also called for the payroll tax threshold to be lowered, effectively increasing it for most small businesses.\n\nTogether, those two hikes would allow the government to cut income taxes by 11 per cent \u2013 or about $43 billion a year.\n\nMurphy's proposal comes weeks after Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the government would work on potential changes to the tax system following the productivity roundtable.\n\nREAD MORE: New major entry rule for Aussies heading to Bali \ufeff\n\nJim Chalmers said the government is examining changes to the tax system.

(Supplied)\n\nMore than 60 per cent of \ufeffAustralian men demonstrate basic financial literacy compared to just 48 per cent of women.\n\nAnd for female athletes, that financial literacy gap can be even wider.\n\nNow the Wests Tigers are doing something about it.\n\nThe club has \ufeffpartnered with Pepper Money to deliver financial literacy workshops to its NRLW team, providing education tailored to women in elite sport and the unique financial challenges they players face.\n\nThe gender pay gap, limited endorsement and sponsorship opportunities,\ufeff and a lack of investment in women's codes puts significant financial strain on Australia's sportswomen, especially those in emerging leagues like the NRLW.\n\n\"Their contracts are shorter, their pay is lower, and their financial journey often includes planning for family or career transitions,\" Pepper Money chief executive Mario Rehayem told 9news.\n\n\"They're also building the foundations of a league that's still evolving. That means they need to be even more financially aware and proactive.\"\n\nThe Wests Tigers partnered with Pepper Money to deliver financial literacy workshops to its NRLW team. (Supplied)\n\nThe NRLW salary cap was $1.2 million this year. In the men's league it was almost 10 times higher.\n\nThe men's minimum salary was triple that of the women's ($120,000 compared to \ufeff$41,800) and they earned twice as much per game in the 2025 State of Origin series.\n\nIt's worth noting that the men's code is more established and lucrative \u2013 but that doesn't make the pay gap any easier for female athletes to navigate.\n\nMost have to work additional jobs on top of training and competing, which Bass did all through her first five NRLW seasons.\n\nThe juggle was \"a lot\" and when she joined the Wests Tigers this year she made the risky decision to focus on footy full-time.\n\n\"Not having that dual income from my other job, I'm not earning as much money as what I did last year,\" she told 9news.com.au.\n\nREAD MORE: The twisted messages posted by church mass shooter\n\nBass gave up her second income to focus on footy, something few female athletes can afford to do. (Instagram/@itsembass)\n\nThe new \ufeff'Mastering Money On and Off the Field' workshops has been invaluable as she navigates the transition from two incomes to one.\n\nThey teach players how to establish smart money habits during their playing career and set themselves up for a financially sound future after retiring from the game.\n\nOne in three athletes admit to making poor financial decisions, according to the Professional Footballers Australia (PFA), and two in five elite athletes aged 18-34 reported suffering poor mental health as a result of financial stress.\n\n\ufeff\"NRLW contracts aren't the most amount of money [and] I'm not too sure where my income is going to come from in the future,\" Bass said.\n\n\"\ufeffThat's a little bit scary\ufeff, it's an uncertain situation to be in, so Pepper Money did talk to us about that emergency fund as well.\n\n\"So post career, if I do struggle to find work or I'm not working for three months for some reason, like I get injured, I do have that safety net there\ufeff.\"\n\nManaging money is \"a little bit scary\ufeff\" when you're playing in an emerging league without the funding the men's game enjoys. (Supplied)\n\nAlmost 90 per cent of athletes \ufeffneed to find new employment post-career to maintain financial security, according to UNI World Athletes, and it's doubly hard for women.\n\nFemale athletes typically receive fewer career opportunities when they retire than their male counterparts; just ask Charmain Steventon.\n\nShe debuted on the \ufeffAustralian Sevens team in 2000\ufeff, represented Australia at the 2002 Rugby XVs World Cup, and won five premierships with West Harbour RFC, and did it all while working a second job.\n\nWhen she finally hung up her boots, she was fortunate \ufeff to have supportive employers and mentors who helped her secure work.\n\nNot every player was so lucky, especially in an era where financial literacy and planning for a future after footy \"wasn't even on the radar\".\n\nNow the \ufeffWests Tigers Head of Women's Football, Steventon is determined to change that for the next generation.\n\nWests Tigers Head of Women's Football, Charmain Steventon.

        "text": "Oliver Miles never thought he would play footy again, catch a wave with his mates or join his dad on a boat, fishing the pristine waters off Queensland's Capricorn Coast.\n\nJust weeks before Christmas in 2023, the Yeppoon teenager was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of leukaemia.\n\n\"It was quite unexpected being diagnosed with leukaemia a week after being at footy training,\" he remembered.\n\n\"I was feeling healthy and pretty good and being diagnosed was like a blind-side moment really.\"\n\nFrom that moment, the then 16-year-old was in the fight of his life.\n\nOllie Miles spent 14 months in hospital undergoing various treatments. (Supplied: Ollie Miles)\n\nImmediately after his diagnosis, Ollie, as he's affectionately known, and his family relocated to Brisbane to start his treatment, which included participating in a new medical trial.\n\n\"I think for a lot of people, getting diagnosed with any sort of cancer is epic and everyone handles it differently and we just couldn't believe it,\" Ollie's dad Clint said.\n\n\"He was a kid that had basically been kicking goals and going from strength to strength school-wise, mates-wise, with footy and other sports.\n\n\"To go from footy training on a Thursday to literally on a hospital bed on the Monday with nothing really positive ahead [was a shock].\"\n\nOllie's remarkable footy comeback\n\nOllie Miles flies high to take a mark for his Yeppoon Swans junior team. (Supplied: Ollie Miles)\n\nAfter building his strength and immunity back, Ollie returned to the football field earlier this year for the first time since his diagnosis.\n\nClint said the chance to play alongside his mates again kept Ollie going.\n\n\"It meant a hell of a lot to Oliver but also for a lot of those young men really that were around him and they went through it all from the beginning with him, by his side,\" he said.\n\nLast Sunday, the comeback was complete, with Ollie kicking the final goal in his team's junior grand final win.\n\nOllie Miles is mobbed by his teammates after kicking the final goal of the grand final.

(Supplied: Clint Miles)\n\nThe journey and life-saving treatment\n\nIt's been nearly two years since Ollie started on a daily regime of chemotherapy at the Brisbane Children's Hospital, even having treatment on Christmas day.\n\nHis treatment plan changed daily during the 14-month battle for the Miles family, including being part of a worldwide trial for the Philadelphia chromosome-positive gene.\n\n\"It was kitchen-sink time to throw at this cancer,\" Clint said.\n\nOllie Miles's older brother, Ari, was a perfect DNA match for a bone marrow transplant. (Supplied: Ollie Miles)\n\nOllie's groundbreaking treatment and bone marrow transplant from older brother, Ari, were successful and he was able to return to Yeppoon with his family late last year.\n\n\"The top floor [of the cancer ward] down there [in Brisbane] is not where any parent ever wants to be and definitely no kid deserves to be there,\" Clint said.\n\n\"The doctors, nurses, 24/7 staff were amazing and stayed positive \u2026 they kept him alive.\n\n\"Sometimes you get these little [medical] breakthroughs and you just have to be on the right side of it.\"\n\nThe Miles family from Yeppoon in central Queensland during happier times before Ollie's diagnosis. (Supplied: Clint Miles)\n\nThe Capricorn Coast community in central Queensland rallied behind the Miles family during the daunting ordeal, especially his beloved footy club the Yeppoon Swans and high school St Brendan's College.\n\nThe club and his school showed support by shaving their heads for the Leukemia Foundation's Shave for a Cure and raised money for Ollie and his family.\n\nOllie, now 18, said the support played a huge role in getting him through this dark and challenging time.\n\n\"It was great peace of mind, knowing that everyone was thinking about me and everyone was sending their support,\" Ollie said.\n\nThe Yeppoon community rallied behind Ollie Miles as he tackled his shock cancer diagnosis. (Supplied: Clint Miles)\n\nRaising awareness about blood cancer\n\nIn Australia, an average 55 people are told each day they have blood cancer and the disease claims the lives of more than 6,300 people each year.\n\nOne in three people will not survive five years after their diagnosis.\n\nThe Leukaemia Foundation's head of research, Bill Stavreski, said more than 20,000 people would be newly diagnosed with blood cancer such as leukaemia, lymphoma or myeloma, this year.\n\nBill Stavreski says Ollie Miles's story is one of hope. (Supplied: Leukaemia Foundation)\n\n\"What we are seeing is over the last 20 years \u2026 the number of blood cancer cases have nearly doubled,\" he said.\n\n\"It doesn't discriminate, it affects young and old alike, and it is actually the leading cancer amongst Australian kids.\n\n\"Likewise it doesn't discriminate against whether you live in metro or regional areas.\"\n\nOllie Miles says the support of the Yeppoon Swans played a huge role in his return to the field. (Supplied: Ollie Miles)\n\nSeptember is Blood Cancer Month for the Leukaemia Foundation.\n\nMr Stavreski said survival stories like Ollie's helped raise awareness and educate people about the disease.\n\n\"It's a fairytale story and it's really great not only that Ollie has recovered from his long treatment but to get back on the footy field,\" he said.\n\n\" Whoever has written the script for Ollie to kick the winning goal, I mean, that's wonderful. \"\n\nAway from the footy field, Ollie Miles is a keen fisherman and surfer. (Supplied: Yeppoon Swans)\n\nNow in remission, Ollie's next three-month check-up in Brisbane is at the end of the month, but in the meantime, the fun-loving Yeppoon teen has other plans now the footy season is over.\n\n\"Oh, 100 per cent. Every time I'm not at footy I'm out on the boat fishing and surf whenever there's a wave,\" he said.",

(Supplied)\n\nThe complaint alleged the advertisement breached the advertising Environmental Claims Code, including by being misleading or deceptive.\n\nAd Standards found the advertisement's claim that Alcoa had rehabilitated 75 per cent of the forest it had cleared was not truthful.\n\nAlcoa said in its response the definition of \"rehabilitation\" referred to \"management actions that aim to reinstate a level of ecosystem productivity or function\", not \"restoring the Jarrah Forest to its natural ecosystem\".\n\nAlcoa has permission to mine thousands of kilometres of jarrah forest, but its rehabilitation efforts are under scrutiny. (Declan Taylor )\n\n\"The Panel considered that the overall impression created by the advertisement was inaccurate and likely to mislead or deceive target consumers,\" the report said.\n\n\"While the target consumer may understand the land had not been returned to its former state, they were also unlikely to understand that rehabilitation is a long-term project and the areas referred to as rehabilitated may only contain seedlings and not forest.\"\n\nClaims 'overstated'\n\nThe advertising watchdog also found Alcoa did not support the claims made in the advertisement with evidence, used language which was \"not clear or specific\", and made \"overstated\" claims.\n\nAd Standards rejected a fifth claim that Alcoa's environmental claims about future objectives were not based on reasonable grounds at the time they were made.\n\nInside Alcoa's plans to expand mining in WA's jarrah forests Photo shows A hi-vis yellow hard hat with Alcoa printed on the front.

In Australia and around the world we are consistently recognised for our approach to sustainability.\"\n\nRehabilitation contested: CCWA\n\nThe Conservation Council of WA (CCWA) said there was some vindication from the finding, but said it was vital companies like Alcoa got it right the first time.\n\nJarrah forest near the Serpentine dam has been mined by the US aluminium giant.

(ABC Goulburn Murray: Coco Veldkamp)\n\nMr Shields said the Shepparton region had just nine glaziers servicing a population of more than 130,000 people.\n\nHe said many of those businesses were likely to close in the next five years, due to ageing staff and a lack of new apprentices.\n\n\"As a trade that isn't widely known, there isn't a rush of potential candidates,\" Mr Shields said.\n\n\"Add to that the lure of better pay initially in retail, the pressure to be perfect with production because we are a finishing trade, the manual lifting and the occasional cuts, [and we] see employees leave the industry.\n\n\" I have lost count of how many I have mentored, but only one is still in the trade full-time. \"\n\nAustralian Glass and Window Association head of industry development Melissa Baker said the number of apprentices in the glass and glazing industry was extremely low.\n\n\"With glass becoming an increasingly prominent feature in both commercial and residential buildings, the demand for skilled workers continues to grow,\" she said.\n\nTrade industry bodies are warning the workforce may struggle to meet government housing targets.

(ABC South East SA: Isadora Bogle)\n\n\"In the context of housing construction, we can't build as many homes as we would like to because we just don't have the size of the workforce that we need,\" he said.\n\nMr Bingham said many factors contributed to trade skills shortages, including negative perceptions of vocational training, and differing opinions around policy settings for apprenticeships.\n\nBarriers for women in construction industry Photo shows A woman holding a nail gun on a construction site As Australia's construction industry continues to suffer from a worker shortage, these female tradies say more women want to take up the tools but can't due to sexist attitudes on the site.\n\nHe also said industries dominated by one gender were more likely to have shortages.\n\nMaster Builders Victoria chief executive Michaela Lihou said attracting new entrants into construction trades was important.\n\n\"Our members across the state have let us know that it is harder to attract apprentices into trades than it was 20 years ago, and getting more people into apprenticeships is critically important to deliver the homes that we need,\" she said.\n\n\"It is essential that every region across Victoria has access to quality training and clear career pathways into trades to support us meeting the Victorian housing target.'\n\nMichaela Lihou has been the CEO of Master Builders Victoria since 2023.

        "text": "Details of the government's actions and the advice of public servants could be more easily hidden under a new Albanese government proposal to weaken Freedom of Information (FOI) laws.\n\nAttorney-General Michelle Rowland will introduce legislation on Wednesday that would make it harder for journalists and members of the public to gain access to documents related to government \"deliberations\".\n\nIt would also \"clarify\" the rules about when documents could be deemed confidential because they related to cabinet processes, an avenue the Robodebt royal commission found was routinely abused by public servants as an excuse to refuse FOI requests.\n\nThe details of this \"clarification\" are not yet known, but the ABC understands the change may lead to more documents being labelled as cabinet confidential, not fewer.\n\nFreedom of Information laws allow members of the public and journalists to access information about government decisions and processes, and have long been contested between transparency advocates favouring stronger laws and bureaucrats who say confidentiality allows them give freer advice to government.\n\nThe proposal would also introduce a mandatory fee to lodge requests. A spokesperson for Ms Rowland said the purpose of this was to stamp out vexatious requests, and that there would be an exemption for those seeking information about themselves.\n\nThe fee would be broadly in line with fees charged by some state governments, of roughly $30 to $50 per request.\n\n\"Freedom of Information is a vital feature of our democratic system \u2026 [But] the FOI framework is stuck in the 1980s,\" Ms Rowland said in a statement.\n\n\"[The] changes will continue to promote transparency in government while ensuring public sector resources are not unduly misused by anonymous or vexatious requests.\"\n\nLabor cites 'frivolous' requests as motivation\n\nAccording to figures quoted by the attorney-general, public servants spent more than a million hours processing FOI requests in the 2023-24 financial year including spam, threats and \"frivolous\" requests.\n\nIn one instance, a single entity sent 580 FOI requests in a short window, diverting an entire public service team for more than three months. In another, an applicant made numerous requests.\n\nBut the FOI system is also used by members of the public seeking information about decisions made by officials that affect them \u2014 72 per cent of requests \u2014 and by journalists seeking information about the actions of officials and politicians.\n\nWhile fees are not currently mandatory, departments often seek hefty sums to process requests, or refuse them on the grounds that they would take too long to process. Documents related to government deliberations are also routinely excluded.\n\nMs Rowland's statement framed the current laws as \"barriers to frank and fearless advice from the public service\", echoing the common claim by bureaucrats that FOI laws cause them to censor what they tell their ministers because they fear publication.\n\nThe Albanese government has faced criticism for its transparency on a number of fronts, including its responses to FOI requests, answers to orders for the production of documents from opposition and crossbench parliamentarians, and tendency to make stakeholders sign non-disclosure agreements when they consult on policies.\n\nShadow Attorney-General Julian Leeser said the proposal for a mandatory FOI fee was a \"truth tax\", but declined to comment on other elements of the bill, saying he was yet to be briefed.\n\n\"This is a government that talked a big game on transparency when they came to office, but what they've done since they came to office is anything but transparent,\" Mr Leeser said.\n\nGreens justice spokesperson David Shoebridge said the proposal would \"make it even harder to get access to government information\".\n\n\"They've looked at the FOI system and decided the problem was you trying to get information and not the secretive departments and ministers that are repeatedly trying to hide it \u2026 What are they trying to hide from us this time?\"",

        "text": "Weather conditions at a West Australian port have caused record shipping delays, led to cost increases and created challenges for farmers, exporters and miners.\n\nWinter storms and long waves, which have an extended period between crests, have caused surges in water levels at Geraldton Port, resulting in excessive and unsafe ship movements.\n\nThe CBH Group receives farmers' grain and operates most of the wharf-based grain loading facilities in the state.\n\nIt is also one of Australia's largest grain exporters.\n\nCBH Geraldton zone general manager Collette Newton said the cooperative had lost 900 hours of ship loading time at the port due to surge closures from October to August, doubling the previous delay record.\n\n\"We have seen an unprecedented level of surge,\" she said.\n\n\"We've seen a spike in surge since June.\n\n\"All port users have been affected, including us.\"\n\nMs Newton said the cooperative was averaging a 16-day turnaround for ships at Geraldton, which was \"a lot higher\" than what was ideal.\n\nAn iron ore ship sails out of Geraldton on a calm morning. (ABC Mid West Wheatbelt: Jo Prendergast)\n\nCost blowouts\n\nShipping records show some ships have experienced much longer turnaround times.\n\nBulk carrier Kea arrived in Geraldton on July 15 to be loaded with 18,000 tonnes of wheat, but the CBH-chartered ship did not depart until August 26.\n\nIndustry estimates put the daily shipping rate for vessels of that size at $15,000, meaning the 41 days the vessel spent in Geraldton could have amounted to $615,000.\n\nRecords show four ships, the YM Summit, the Ultra Esterhazy, the Ocean Makmur and SSI Providence were at anchor in Geraldton for more than 30 days during July and August.\n\nSome grain exporters are understood to be changing their plans to avoid Geraldton because of its track record of delays.\n\nMs Newton said CBH had moved some vessels to other ports and increased its road capacity to relieve some pressure on the port.\n\nShe said that despite the challenges, the cooperative had exported nearly 3 million tonnes of grain this season, putting it in a \"really good position\" to deal with the upcoming grain harvest.\n\nMs Newton said CBH was also in the process of upgrading some port storage.\n\nThe next port is 450 kilometres away at Kwinana.\n\nGeraldton Port is a vital export point for the region's miners. (ABC Mid West Wheatbelt: Natasha Harradine)\n\n250-hour closure\n\nFenix Resources shipped 2.4 million tonnes of iron ore from the Geraldton Port last financial year.\n\nExecutive chair John Welborn said in July alone, the port was closed for 250 hours due to surge, and that made logistics difficult.\n\n\"The impact of surge events slows down our ability to ship, and therefore delays the receipt of revenue,\" he said.\n\n\"The most important thing is to be efficient with our ship movements.\n\n\" It's a big cost to us if there is demurrage, if the ship is required to stay at anchor, that's inefficient. \"\n\nSurge from winter weather caused significant delays at the Geraldton port (ABC News: Gian De Poloni)\n\nMr Welborn said the Geraldton port was an important export terminal for WA and vital for the Mid West.\n\nDespite the port closures, he said the miner was still usually able to turn vessels around in 24 hours.\n\n\"We are loading around 60,000 tonnes of iron ore at Berth 5 in Geraldton,\" Mr Welborn said.\n\n\"The Mid West Ports Authority can load that material from our storage facility at about 3,000 tonne an hour.\"\n\nLike CBH, Fenix owns and operates an integrated supply chain, from its mines in the Mid West, to road haulage and port storage companies.\n\nA 400-metre breakwater will be built to protect Geraldton Port from storm surge.

(ABC Mid West Wheatbelt: Natasha Harradine)\n\nHe said the port was averaging 32 days per year of surge-related delays, but this year had been \"one of the worst\".\n\n\"We have seen an unprecedented number of weather events affecting us over winter this year,\" he said.\n\nMr Tully said the port was meeting with all impacted customers to plan the most efficient shipping as possible.",

(Supplied: Diana Matthews)\n\nFor many years, the early deaths on the paternal side of the family were attributed to bad luck, but in 1995 the death of Emma's paternal uncle from leukaemia prompted an investigation that revealed the presence of the Li-Fraumeni gene variant.\n\nLi-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a rare genetic condition that predisposes carriers to developing various cancers early in life.\n\n\"It's quite an aggressive gene, and unfortunately Emma is the only one of my children that inherited the gene from her father, who passed away when he was 40,\" Ms Matthews said.\n\nEmma Trenerry's siblings were lucky not to inherit the Li-Fraumeni gene. (Supplied: Diana Matthews)\n\nEmma's cancer journey\n\nAs a preventative measure, Emma underwent a hysterectomy in 2020, even before testing positive to LFS.\n\nDuring the surgery, doctors discovered and removed a cervical cancer.\n\nTwo years later, during a follow-up full-body MRI scan, doctors found an 8x7x5-centimetre sarcoma growing in her spine.\n\n\"She did have a bit of pain in her hip for a while, which was diagnosed as being arthritic, but when she had the MRI they found cancer in her hip, and it was quite large already,\" Ms Matthews said.\n\nEmma Trenerry, who has a terminal diagnosis, is determined to see another Christmas with her family. (Supplied: Diana Matthews)\n\nEmma had six months of chemotherapy and eight rounds of radiotherapy, which put her in remission for six months.\n\nBut unfortunately the tumour started to grow again.\n\n\"Any cancers that come up, Emma's body cannot shut them down,\" Ms Matthews said.\n\nFor Emma, her only option is to \"keep going\" with the time she has left.\n\n\"[I'm] as good as I can be, I guess,\" she said.\n\n\" It's hard not being able to do what I used to do, but my kids are just absolutely amazing; they've been through a lot and just watching them grow is amazing. \"\n\nEmma Trenerry's family and friends staged a Christmas in July celebration for her. (Supplied: Diana Matthews)\n\nRaising funds to pay for cancer drug\n\nDuring treatments, Emma was informed of a trial for the cancer-inhibiting drug Cabozantinib, a tablet medication developed by US pharmaceutical company Exelixis.\n\nAt $9,500 for a two-month supply, she was initially told by her doctor that she could access the medication for free.\n\nThey have since learnt that she is ineligible to receive the drug under the PBS.\n\nPrepared to do anything to prolong her daughter's life, Ms Matthews and her sister Val made it their mission to learn as much they could about Cabozantinib, and raised the $9,500 needed to buy the drug.\n\n\"After just two months taking the tablet, the specialist rang us back and said it was working, that it had stopped the growth of the major tumour, and it had stopped the growth of the tumours in her lungs,\" Ms Matthews said.\n\nMs Matthews' nieces then set up a fundraising page called Emma vs the Big C, raising enough money to pay for two more rounds, thanks to a TikTok post on Emma's story by kindness influencer Samuel Widenhofer.\n\nEmma has been taking the drug for six months and said she was grateful for the extra time it had given her with her children.\n\n\"It kills cancer cells, well, it kills a lot of cells, to the point [where] my hair turned white \u2026 but when I had a scan done it had actually killed all the active cells there so it helps me live a bit longer,\" she said.\n\nEmma Trenerry, her husband Warren and their three children have tried to live a normal life. (Supplied: Diana Matthews)\n\nWitnessing the success of the drug, Emma's specialist asked for the full price to be waived, but the request was declined, her family said.\n\nMs Matthews said if Emma paid for and survived eight rounds (16 months) of the drug, she could receive Cabozantinib from the company for free, meaning the family needed to come up with $50,000 for the five remaining rounds in the meantime.\n\nDrug available for some cancers\n\nCabozantinib is available under the PBS for treating stage-four renal cell carcinoma and for certain thyroid cancers under certain circumstances.\n\nEligible patients can receive Cabozantinib through the PBS for $31.60 or $7.70 if they hold a concession card.\n\nA federal health department spokesperson said the drug did not have Therapeutic Goods Administration approval for treating osteosarcoma.\n\n\"Using it for this purpose would be considered 'off-label', and doctors should discuss the risks and benefits with patients before prescribing,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"There are various medicines listed on the PBS that may be used in the treatment of osteosarcoma \u2026 which are available on the PBS without restrictions. This means any patient can access them if prescribed.\"\n\nIn Emma's case, the family said it was told there was nothing else suitable.\n\nThe Nilma Darnum football and netball community has rallied behind Emma Trenerry and her family. (ABC Gippsland: Rachael Lucas)\n\nFooty club intervenes\n\nEmma said that one of her biggest fears was that her kids would forget who she was.\n\nBut she said in her own way, she felt like she had already defeated the cancer.\n\n\" Them not having the gene, I feel like I've already beaten it. They don't have it, so it ends at me now, so I am very blessed. \"\n\nAs an animal lover, aspiring vet nurse and fan of Steve Irwin, Emma had always wanted to visit Australia Zoo in Queensland.\n\nComing to the end of her third round, and down to her last $10,000, Emma then had to decide whether to go on a holiday with her family to make some final memories, or invest in another month's worth of medication, knowing that it could prolong, but not save her life.\n\nBut the family's beloved Nilma Darnum Football Club didn't want Emma to make that decision.\n\nThe Nilma Darnum Football Netball Club has raised $74,000 for Emma Trenerry. (Supplied: Diana Matthews)\n\nEarlier this month, they organised an \"I walked to Australia Zoo for Emma\" fundraising event, in which more than 500 people walked 4,900 laps of the club's football oval, the 1,960-kilometre distance from Darnum to Australia Zoo.\n\nThey also auctioned off a dinner with former Collingwood star Nathan Buckley, raising an accumulative total of $74,000, for Emma to have a family holiday and pay for more rounds of medication.\n\nEmma, her husband and kids are enjoying a two-week trip of a lifetime on the Sunshine Coast, with the club even organising limousine transfers and a back-of-house tour of Australia Zoo so Emma could hold the animals.\n\nEmma Trenerry and her family embark on the trip of a lifetime to make some memories at Australia Zoo.

She just gets up and does what she has to do,\" Ms Matthews said.\n\n\"She cares for people. She cares for animals. She's just kind.

        "text": "A class action lawsuit is being prepared against the state of Queensland and the Department of Youth Justice over the treatment of juveniles at youth detention centres.\n\nThis week legal firm Levitt Robinson announced it was preparing to launch action on behalf of detainees at Cleveland, Brisbane, West Moreton, Sir Leslie Wilson and John Oxley youth detention centres.\n\nThe Sydney-based law firm also launched action against the WA government over the alleged unlawful treatment of juvenile detainees at Banksia Hill Detention Centre.\n\nFirm partner Dana Levitt said the action would be based on what was considered the punitive and unlawful conditions of detention.\n\n\"This is about ensuring that legal standards are adhered to and that the purposes and goals of detention are realised, and that isn't being done at the moment,\" she said.\n\nDana Levitt says the action is being prepared on behalf of past and present detainees. (ABC News: Patrick Thomas)\n\nThe firm says it is aiming to seek compensation for detainees who were subjected to confinement due to staff shortages and their placement in an unhygienic cell, as well as a lack of access to running water or a working toilet.\n\nThe action will also aim to seek compensation for juvenile detainees left without access to services such as education, lack of access to meaningful out of cell time and a lack of psychosocial supports.\n\n\"Whether you're an adult prisoner or a child there are certain minimum standards to which the state has to comply,\" Ms Levitt said.\n\n\"Just because you're in jail or youth detention doesn't mean that the state can treat you however they want to treat you or, indeed, how they have to treat you because they don't have enough staff working that day.\"\n\nStaff shortages and isolation\n\nThe firm's action stems from the conditions at Cleveland Youth Detention Centre in Townsville, which has long been plagued by reports of staff shortages and other issues.\n\nIn August last year, Queensland's prison watchdog flagged human rights concerns at the centre.\n\nDuring that visit, Inspector of Detention Services Anthony Reilly found children were frequently locked alone in their cells due to staffing shortages, or held in separation rooms with no toilet, bed or running water.\n\nLast month Australian Workers' Union northern district secretary Jim Wilson told the ABC he was hearing of severe, weekly staff shortages at the facility.\n\n\"We can't run the centre at the moment properly with the number of staff that we have and the way things are going at the moment,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to see some significant improvements and we need to see a genuine plan.\"\n\nHe said understaffing at Cleveland Youth Detention Centre was putting workers at risk.\n\nLevitt Robinson wants to speak to former or current detainees in five Queensland facilities. (ABC North Qld: Chloe Chomicki)\n\n\"When a young person is left in confinement for 23 hours a day they can become very volatile, so that makes them more dangerous to our staff,\" Mr Wilson said.\n\n\"In our enterprise agreement currently there's a designated ratio of no more than four young people per youth detention worker.\n\n\" Staff shortages are so bad it's very difficult for that ratio to be met pretty regularly. \"\n\nDetainees asked to come forward\n\nMs Levitt said the firm was seeking to speak with people who had been in the five Queensland youth detention centres from 2005 onwards.\n\n\"We're really looking at everything that happens to a child when they're in detention and considering them against the law that prescribes those minimum standards,\" she said.\n\nIn December last year the Crisafulli government passed its flagship \"adult crime, adult time\" laws, which involve juveniles being tried as adults for offences such as murder, manslaughter and rape.\n\nMs Levitt said tougher penalties for young people were an ineffectual way of dealing with youth crime.\n\n\"It's become incredibly clear that there is very little political will to address the causes of youth justice involved children \u2014 looking at why they end up committing crimes and looking to remediate those root causes,\" she said.\n\nYouth Justice and Victim Support Minister Laura Gerber did not respond to questions on the preparation of the class action.\n\nShe said the state government was making Queensland safer with stronger laws, more police, early intervention and rehabilitation.\n\n\"Labor created the Youth Crime Crisis and failed to build the infrastructure needed to arrest it,\" she said.",

        "text": "Former heavyweight boxing champion Joe Bugner, who lived more than half his life on the Gold Coast and fought under the name \"Aussie Joe\", has died in a Brisbane care home aged 75.\n\nBorn in Hungary, Bugner made his name in Britain but only felt accepted in Australia. He won the Australian, British, European and Commonwealth belts, capping his career by becoming the oldest world heavyweight champion, albeit with one of the lower profile titles of the several on offer in the sport.\n\nAt his peak, he fought Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in back-to-back fights in 1973, and faced Ali again for his WBA and WBC world championships in 1975. He lost all three bouts on points, being the only man both fought but neither knocked out.\n\nAt the peak of his career, the Hungarian-born Bugner fought US heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali. (Supplied: Associated Press)\n\nHis blond locks, brash talking and pugilistic excellence made him a household name in Britain in the 1970s, but he felt he was never forgiven for ending the career of national treasure Henry Cooper and emigrated.\n\nAfter moving to Australia in 1986 he made several comebacks, partly motivated by financial issues after a vineyard investment went awry.\n\nHe became the Australian heavyweight champ in 1995, then beat James \"Bonecrusher\" Smith to win the World Boxing Federation title at the age of 48 three years later.\n\nBugner fought Ali twice, going the distance both times. (AP: Dave Pickoff)\n\nHe also appeared in the 1994 action-thriller Street Fighter alongside Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue, the 2003 Australian crime caper film Gettin' Square, and was a contestant in the television show I'm A Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out Of Here in 2009.\n\nBorn Jozsef Kreul Bugner in Szoreg, southern Hungary, on March 13, 1950, he left aged six with his four siblings after the 1956 Soviet invasion. His single mother Margaret whisked them away via a bus to Yugoslavia and a night-time walk through a forest.\n\nSettling as a refugee in Britain, he made an impact in sport at school and turned professional at 17.\n\nIn the mid-1990s Bugner staged a comeback to boxing, including a victory over Vince Cervi at the Carrara Entertainment Centre on the Gold Coast. (AP: Steve Holland)\n\nKnocked out on his debut by a bus driver, he won 31 of his next 33 bouts before beating Cooper by a quarter of a point in 1971.\n\nYears later, Bugner lamented the victory.\n\n\"I wish I had never ruddy fought Henry Cooper. It got me chased out of England,\" he said.\n\n\"In the eyes of the press, I was a refugee who had come to Britain and made a fortune by beating people up.\"\n\nHis sculpted face and torso plus a defensive approach that relied heavily on a ramrod jab led to sportswriter Hugh McIlvanney remarking Bugner possessed \"the physique of a Greek statue but with fewer moves\".\n\nAli was more impressed. After Bugner survived 15 rounds in steaming heat in Kuala Lumpur he said: \"Watch out for Bugner. He'll be the champion a couple of years from now.\"\n\nThat proved wrong but Bugner kept fighting on and off for another two decades, ending with 69 wins, 13 defeats and one draw.\n\nBugner lived more than half his life on the Gold Coast and died in a Brisbane care home after being diagnosed with dementia. (AAP: Tracey Nearmy)\n\nIn 1995 he came out of retirement to beat Vince Cervi in Carrara and win the Australian title.\n\nThe following year he defeated Young Haumona for the Pacific and Australasian title.\n\nHe regained the Australian title, which he had relinquished, in 1997, defeating Colin Wilson, and defended both titles in 1998 before retiring for good in 1999.\n\nBugner spent the final years of his life in a Brisbane care home after being diagnosed with dementia. He is survived by his three children: James, Joe Jr and Amy.\n\nAAP",

        "text": "Australians' surging appetite for berries has forced the national farm chemical watchdog to review the risk of exposure to harmful levels of a popular pesticide.\n\nBlueberry, blackberry and raspberry consumption has more than doubled in less than a decade, prompting the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) to propose new regulations for the use of dimethoate.\n\nExecutive director of risk assessment capability, Sheila Logan, said current residue levels were unlikely to pose a serious risk to human health but safety margins needed to be reconsidered.\n\n\"I certainly wouldn't suggest that anyone needs to avoid eating berries,\" Dr Logan said.\n\nSheila Logan says berries are safe to eat. (Supplied: Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority)\n\nGrowers must wait one day after spraying blueberries and seven days after spraying rubus berries (blackberries and raspberries) before they can pick and send the fruit to market.\n\nDr Logan's authority has proposed that the time between spraying and picking be increased to 14 days.\n\nThat has put the watchdog at odds with the $1.3 billion industry.\n\nGrowers said the proposal would increase costs.\n\nThey said the risks could be managed with a shorter timeframe without disrupting production and pushing up prices.\n\nMeanwhile, food safety experts recommended consumers be aware of the risks, adopt safe handling practices at home and eat a diverse range of fruits.\n\nMargin of safety\n\nDimethoate has been used in Australia since the 1950s to control more than 80 insect pests in fruit, vegetables and grains.\n\nBut it was banned by the European Union in 2019 and has been classified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as a \"possible human carcinogen\".\n\nQueensland fruit fly is one of the horticultural industry's worst pests. (Supplied: Western Australian Agricultural Authority)\n\nThe chemical has also faced increased scrutiny in Australia, most recently when the APVMA banned its use as a post-harvest dip for avocados, mangoes and other tropical fruits.\n\nTo use it, growers need a permit from the APVMA, which dictates safe usage based on acceptable residue limits.\n\nThe permit details how much of the chemical can be present in food and still be safely consumed.\n\nDr Logan said berry consumption, excluding strawberries, had risen to 1.3 kilograms per person a year, from 611 grams when the limits were last considered in 2017.\n\n\"It's a concern that there may not be that full margin of safety, which has led us to propose to suspend these uses,\" Dr Logan said.\n\n\"The key priority for the APVMA is the protection of human health and the environment.\"\n\nAnthony Poiner says dimethoate is the most effective chemical to combat Queensland fruit fly in berries. (Supplied: Fresh Produce Group)\n\nBerries Australia chair Anthony Poiner said extending the restriction period to two weeks would effectively ban the chemical.\n\n\"Berries are picked every two to seven days, so if you spray one day and have to wait 14 days, all the berries have gone overripe and are no longer usable,\" Dr Poiner said.\n\n\"Our tests are telling us that levels of residual dimethoate after 24 hours of being sprayed are low and below the medically acute level.\"\n\nDr Poiner, whose PhD is in chemistry, said dimethoate was the most effective option for controlling Queensland fruit fly, a native insect that had cost growers at least $300 million a year in control and trade restrictions.\n\nGrowers say prices could rise if dimethoate is banned. (ABC Rural: Brandon Long)\n\n\"This [suspension] would be highly damaging to the berry industry because it is the most efficacious of all the chemical applications,\" he said.\n\nHe said alternatives such as fumigation, irradiation or other chemicals were more costly and less effective, and organic production could not supply the market at scale.\n\nSafe to eat\n\nCSIRO food scientist Rozita Spirovska Vaskoska said all fresh food carried some risk.\n\nRozita Vaskoska says safe food handling practices help avoid contaminants. (Supplied)\n\n\"It's not that organic food does not have any risks, or traditionally produced food doesn't have risks, they just have differing risks,\" Dr Vaskoska said.\n\nShe said food produced in an organic system typically involved fewer chemical treatments, but it could carry a higher risk of other contaminants such as bacteria.\n\nWashing produce could reduce, but not eliminate, the risk from both, but she said eating a wide variety of foods and practicing safe food handling at home was best.\n\n\"Having variety in our diet and \u2026 following good kitchen storage and cooking practices will maintain our food safety,\" she said.\n\nDr Poiner said the industry accepted a need for caution and growers were committed to working with the regulators to find a solution.\n\n\"We should have confidence in the food we eat,\" he said.\n\nFruit fly is an established pest in multiple states. (Supplied: Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry)\n\nHe said restrictions would mean higher costs and more on-farm waste for growers in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, but Western Australia and Tasmania were largely fruit-fly free and would be less affected.\n\nThe APVMA said all other approved uses of dimethoate remained safe and no other chemicals used on berries required action at this stage.\n\nSubmissions on the proposed suspension are open until September 2.",

China does have some military engines it has developed itself, and its key aircraft manufacturer, Comac, is developing an engine for its C919 narrow-bodied commercial planes, but it is still heavily reliant on Boeing and Europe\u2019s Airbus for engines and parts. He could also deny \u2013 and has been denying, until recently \u2013 China\u2019s access to the most advanced US semiconductors. China isn\u2019t petrified by the prospect of extreme tariff rates, as its response to Trump\u2019s 145 per cent rate earlier this year demonstrated. Credit: Getty When Trump first slapped new tariffs on China earlier this year, China retaliated with tariff hikes of its own \u2013 and stopped allowing exports of rare earths and rare earth magnets to the US. A meeting in Sweden saw the confrontation de-escalated, with the US reducing its headline tariff rate to 30 per cent and China its rate to 10 per cent. (The headline rates are misleading because Trump added to pre-existing tariffs, dating back to his first term, and China has also been subjected to the general sectoral tariffs on commodities like steel and aluminium and products derived from them, as well as those slapped on Canada and Mexico for their claimed role in fentanyl trafficking. The Peterson Institute for International Economics puts the average US tariff on China\u2019s exports at 57.6 per cent and China\u2019s rate on US exports at 32.6 per cent).\n\nLoading There have since been a succession of 90-day extensions of the truce agreed in Stockholm and confirmed at a subsequent meeting of the trade negotiators in London which have deferred any final agreement on trade until early November. As part of that truce deal, China has allowed exports of rare earth magnets to resume, although it wasn\u2019t until July, when the volume of rare earth magnet imports from China suddenly jumped 76 per cent, that the supply regained pre-confrontation levels. China knows that its dominance of rare earths and the magnets in particular \u2013 it controls more than 70 per cent of the global supply, more than 90 per cent of the processing of rare earths and more than 90 per cent of the processing and manufacturing of rare earth permanent magnets \u2013 gives it tremendous leverage over the US. When it throttled supply of the magnets earlier this year it nearly shut down the US auto industry. The magnets are also critical to many other commercial and military applications.\n\nThe US doesn\u2019t have meaningful alternate sources of supply, although it is racing to develop some, including Defence Department funding for Australia\u2019s Lynas Rare Earths to build a separation facility in Texas. It has also arranged a $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) debt facility, $US150 million of Defence Department loans, $US400 million of equity and a 10-year floor price \u2013 at twice the current level set by China \u2013as part of guaranteed purchase commitment for 100 per cent of the output from America\u2019s only significant producer, MP Materials. While China has resumed exports of rare earth magnets to the US, for instance, it appears to be limiting sales to the US defence industry. Credit: AP There are, however, estimates that it will take 15 years and $US120 billion for the US to completely distance its rare earths supply chain from China, which developed its dominance over decades. Indeed, it ambition of dominating rare earths dates back to the 1980s. China, while it might prefer to maintain its trade with the US, isn\u2019t petrified by the prospect of extreme tariff rates, as its response to Trump\u2019s 145 per cent rate earlier this year demonstrated.\n\nLoading Since Trump first deployed tariffs against it in 2018, Xi Jinping has deliberately diversified China\u2019s range of trading partners and reduced its reliance on America for some key imports \u2013 it has, for instance, nearly halved its imports of soy beans, with Brazil displacing the US as its major supplier \u2013 while also developing alternate export markets in Asia and South America. Trump\u2019s tariffs are a crude weapon, but China\u2019s dominance of rare earths gives it the ability to use it in a highly strategic way. While it has resumed exports of rare earth magnets to the US, for instance, it appears to be limiting sales to the US defence industry. China has tightened its export controls for rare earths progressively, and recently added imports of rare earths that it processes for third parties \u2013 including MP Materials \u2013 to the continually expanding list of minerals subject to its controls and monthly monitoring. It can dial up, or down, its export quotas almost instantly and bring America\u2019s advanced manufacturing base to a near halt.\n\nWhile Trump, understandably, has tried to play down the threat posed by China\u2019s control of the market, it is clear that his administration does understand the degree of leverage it gives China. That\u2019s why it backed down from its extreme tariff rates in Stockholm and that\u2019s why it has adopted a more conciliatory tone since. Both the first Trump administration and, even more substantially the Biden administration, progressively shut semiconductors off China\u2019s access to America\u2019s most advanced semiconductors, with the ban on sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips maintained by the second Trump administration. A complete closure of US markets to China\u2019s exports would hurt China\u2019s economy, but it wouldn\u2019t destroy it. The US has a very significant edge over China in designing the most advanced chips required for artificial intelligence.",

Despite disliking soft dramas \u2013 he prefers them to be grittier \u2013 he found himself playing the lead role in a real-life one, when he fell in love with a colleague while running Nine Entertainment (the owner of this masthead). It was all very awkward for Marks, his new partner, his boss and their colleagues, so he made a decision that took many by surprise: he chose his relationship over his job.

These days he\u2019s a public servant in charge of the public broadcaster, so, in a roundabout way \u2013 given I\u2019m a taxpaying member of that public \u2013 he now works for me. He orders his favourite dish, the pork chops, and I select the ragu as I brief Marks on the usual pattern of these lunchtime interviews: as the one asking the questions, I\u2019ll finish my meal, while he\u2019ll be so busy answering, he won\u2019t get a chance to eat and his food will get cold. \u201cI\u2019ll have to give one-word answers, then,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe doesn\u2019t. Marks hasn\u2019t done many profile-style interviews since he became managing director of the ABC five months ago and he\u2019s at pains to explain his approach. Many at the broadcaster still aren\u2019t quite sure what to expect. They\u2019re uncertain of his vision, or what he plans to change, or whether he\u2019ll be \u201ctoo commercial\u201d, or if he\u2019ll stand up for them when the attacks come from outside, or if he sees a future for traditional radio and terrestrial television given their declining audiences, or even if he watches, listen to and reads the ABC. They can be reassured on the last point. Marks says he has always been a fan of ABC news and current affairs. He likes Wednesday-night comedy. Friday-night dramas are a bit soft for him but he\u2019s enjoying The Family Next Door. \u201cWhen I was at Nine I could watch, listen [to] and read everything,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can do that at the ABC.\u201d But he watches, reads and listens to as much as he can, and does it with his work hat on. \u201cIf you have thoughts about the direction or tone or whatever, you\u2019ve got to be thinking about all those things and talking to the teams about it,\u201d he says. Barbetta\u2019s ragu. Credit: Janie Barrett He no longer feels obliged to watch Married at First Sight, the Nine reality juggernaut that \u201cmarries\u201d two single, extroverted strangers, and is not to everyone\u2019s taste. While he has said he wants the ABC to pursue more hit shows \u2013 to find the next Bluey or MasterChef \u2013 Marks doesn\u2019t put MAFS in that category. Still, he doesn\u2019t shy away from the concept. \u201cLove on the Spectrum is a different version of the same show \u2013 still a dating show, still puts people in a reality contest,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are always different treatments of an idea.\u201d I take Marks back to the subject of dating, given it was at the centre of his departure from the top job at Nine in early 2021. It had been his second stint at the broadcaster, after working there for eight years earlier in his career as in-house legal counsel, then director of film and television, before leaving to become chief executive of Southern Star, which produced reality show Big Brother for Ten, drama Love My Way for Foxtel, and game show Deal or No Deal for Seven.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe replaced David Gyngell as Nine\u2019s chief executive in 2015. The merger he oversaw transformed Nine, creating a multi-platform company with broadcast television, streaming (Stan), publishing and radio. During that time Marks and his wife, with whom he had four children, broke up. His love life was the subject of speculation; he was photographed on a picnic with his executive assistant, who he said was an old friend. But then one of his own papers broke the story that Marks was leaving the business after he had begun a relationship with Nine\u2019s former managing director of commercial, Alexi Baker. Marks ordered the pork cutlet at Barbetta. Credit: Janie Barrett They were two consenting adults. Still, it was messy. Questions flew about who on the board was notified and when, and if there were any promotions or bonuses for Baker. Relationships involving the chief executive and a subordinate make boards nervous. There were already fractures in the board between the Nine and the Fairfax people, and the relationship exacerbated tensions. Marks says he was thinking about leaving anyway, after the merger had been bedded down. The relationship sped up his plans. \u201cIn one sense, you can deal with relationships and stuff through disclosure and all of that,\u201d he says. \u201cIn another, it creates pressures in the business that I just felt at the time was better for us to move on \u2026 to be able to pursue that relationship without the impediment of the organisation.\u201d It must be awkward to have to tell higher-ups about one\u2019s love life? \u201cIt\u2019s awkward but it\u2019s appropriate because the risk of conflict exists,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex mash of personalities and responsibilities. It\u2019s a challenge to make those decisions but it was the right decision.\u201d The story was widely reported; some of the headlines referred to it as a \u201csex scandal\u201d. I ask how he felt about the reporting, and whether he thought his relationship had been unfairly lumped into the broader category of workplace relationship scandals, particularly as it came fresh off the heels of headline-grabbers such as then federal MP Alan Tudge\u2019s affair with a staffer, who accused him of abuse, and Barnaby Joyce\u2019s relationship with his staffer, who he later married.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think in many ways it was more unfair for Alexi than me,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is, I think, a regret. There were certainly elements where we could have said more but chose not to, or where we thought it was unfair and we chose not to say something. We\u2019re comfortable with our own decisions; you have to find that in yourself.\u201d Alexi Baker and Hugh Marks at the Midwinter Ball at Parliament House last month. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen They now have a three-year-old son, Hamish, and will get married in December when Marks\u2019 adult children, two of whom live overseas, can attend. Marks is enjoying fatherhood for the fifth time. He might have more experience at parenting than his partner but he\u2019s conscious of not taking over. \u201cIt\u2019s Alexi\u2019s first child, so [I\u2019m] trying to balance that. They\u2019re such joys, children, they\u2019re so interesting as individuals.\u201d Marks is juggling fifth-time fatherhood with a big job. His experience at Nine prepared him for some elements of the role but not others. He doesn\u2019t have to answer to corporate shareholders but ABC has its own version \u2013 the viewers and staff who feel a strong sense of ownership. Changes bring a big backlash. \u201cI must say,\u201d he says, \u201cone difference between Nine and the ABC was at Nine it was always \u2018can you get rid of?\u2019 At the ABC it\u2019s more \u2018why did you get rid of?\u2019\u201d The cultures at Nine and ABC are different, too. The ABC staff is more unionised than Nine\u2019s television division, staff are public servants, there\u2019s a clear charter and a strong sense of independence from management. He\u2019ll negotiate a new enterprise agreement later this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll always be moments [of conflict],\u201d he says, \u201cbut I hope that my approach is always to engage with people on their work. There\u2019s a great sense of purpose at the ABC but if we can get them to buy into what we\u2019re doing and why, I think we can hopefully get them all to come along.\u201d Marks says he has also learnt from the exposure of the culture of sexual harassment at Nine\u2019s broadcast division, which exploded into the public eye last year but was happening while he was chief executive (he says the harassment allegations were never bought to him and were a surprise). One way to stop those cultures from developing, he says, is to keep an open dialogue with staff, and to listen as well as talk. He admits he has become better at this over the past decade, given his personal travails. \u201cMy empathy levels have also gone way up,\u201d he says. \u201cI think you do learn every time something negative happens.\u201d He is deeply interested in journalism. He is not trained as a journalist but likes to talk to journalists about their stories and provide feedback, which makes some ABC staff \u2013 who spoke to this masthead on the condition of anonymity, so they could speak freely \u2013 nervous about independence, although others like that he values their work. He also wants the ABC to break more stories with impact. This is easier said than done; every journalist wants strong stories but they don\u2019t grow on trees. Investigative journalism, in particular, is expensive. Kim Williams, ABC chair, has been in hot water for raising concerns directly with radio management about editorial decisions on comedian Sandy Gutman. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen \u201cYes, it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Marks says. \u201cOften it\u2019s just having the intellect, when you\u2019ve got a story, to challenge you on \u2026 angles and layers that you may not have thought about,\u201d he says. He sees his role as \u201can overview, looking at tone and balance, fairness, entertainment value and quality\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement",

The 50-seat corner cafe is in an old op shop two blocks from the beach and a five-minute walk from Frankston Station. It replaces a smaller Commonfolk location in the suburb.\n\nThe spacious room has a warm look with coffee-coloured Tuscan tiles, a high communal table with stools that makes a virtue of a central structural pillar, music on vinyl and big windows that promote an indoor-outdoor feel. A good way to blast yourself into the Commonfolk orbit is to order a Yin Yang coffee duo ($8) featuring their Peruvian \u201cCastle in the Sky\u201d blend. You\u2019ll get an espresso and a magic to experience the smooth, apricot-tinged chocolatey roast in two different ways.\n\nChef Kyle Noll (ex-Hatter and the Hare, Locavore Studio) is running an all-day menu that includes half-serves of many items. That hero chilli scramble is strewn with a Ugandan-style tumble of crisp spices with turtle beans and curry powder. The dish is a nod to Zukuka Bora, a Ugandan coffee producer-partner of Commonfolk since 2014. Soft scrambled eggs are layered up with that chilli, dill-infused labne, fermented garlic and preserved lemon for a certified brunch banger. Lamb shoulder with roasted beetroot would be at home in any quality bistro, and a well-constructed avo smash is boosted by green tahini and smashed chickpeas.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size All of a sudden, music felt completely insignificant to Dev Hynes. In early 2023, just as he was preparing to perform a selection of his classical works at the Sydney Opera House, his mother fell sick and was admitted to hospital. Hynes returned to his childhood home in Ilford, in Essex in England, to be by her bedside. Within two months, she had died. He cancelled the Opera House gig, and several other shows, as he took \u201ctime to grieve and focus on getting myself together\u201d. Music had been a constant in Hynes\u2019 life since childhood. He\u2019d started piano lessons at seven and cello at nine, and launched his career in the early aughts in British dance-punk phenoms Test Icicles. As Blood Orange, he\u2019d released several acclaimed solo albums and written and produced revered releases for Sky Ferreira, Solange Knowles and Carly Rae Jepsen. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t matter,\u201d recalls Hynes in a faded Iron Maiden T-shirt from his home in New York, where he\u2019s been based for 17 years. \u201cI really didn\u2019t see a point in it any more.\u201d After his mother\u2019s funeral, to get some distance from the grief of home, Hynes rented a place in Paris, just a brief rail ride from London. One day, as he was tinkering around the apartment, the algorithm served up a song he\u2019d never heard before that stopped him in his tracks. It was Sufjan Stevens\u2019 Fourth of July. \u201cI\u2019m a Sufjan fan and I\u2019m a music obsessive, but I have these crazy music holes where I just miss things, right? But this song came on and it felt like it was speaking to me. It sounded like it was inside my head,\u201d says Hynes. \u201cIt was so visceral and intense.\u201d Fourth of July is a track from Carrie & Lowell, Sufjan Stevens\u2019 harrowing album about the death of his estranged mother. At the time, Hynes knew nothing of the song\u2019s backstory. \u201cIt was quite striking to me because I didn\u2019t know the story, but it went right inside and I understood the song completely. How many mediums can do that? I\u2019m not Sufjan, but I had this feeling of wow, I can\u2019t believe my occupation is the same as the person who made this, I\u2019m involved in a pretty magical medium. And that was the drive I needed.\u201d The result is Essex Honey, Hynes\u2019 first new Blood Orange project since 2018\u2019s acclaimed Negro Swan. He\u2019d continued making music in the intervening years, including film scores for Queen & Slim (2019) and Paul Schrader\u2019s Master Gardener (2022), as well as writing and producing for hardcore stars Turnstile and Argentinian singer Nathy Peluso (for which he won a Latin Grammy in 2024). But why the break from releasing music as Blood Orange?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was a little bit of, what\u2019s the point?\u201d admits Hynes. \u201cMusic was always being made, I never stopped, but I would think to myself: why does it need to be released? It\u2019s a noisy world, and there\u2019s a lot of shit getting thrown at us daily. I don\u2019t want to add my shit to that noise. Why would I do that?\u201d Essex Honey, the first Blood Orange album since 2018, finds Hynes looking back to his childhood. It\u2019s not the usual mindset for a successful musician. \u201cI still feel that a lot, and I have to remind myself that it\u2019s a privilege,\u201d says Hynes. \u201cI\u2019m quite lucky that, a) I know how to make music, and b) I have opportunities to release it, and c) there are people that would actually like to hear it. I think about all that and it\u2019s like, \u2018get over yourself\u2019,\u201d he laughs. That it\u2019s officially 20 years since his first professional release \u2013 Test Icicles\u2019 blog-hit Boa Vs Python came out on August 1, 2005 \u2013 has also played on Hynes\u2019 mind. \u201cI never could have dreamt, 20 years ago, that I\u2019d still be releasing albums,\u201d he says. \u201cI think of all the incredible musicians who don\u2019t have those opportunities, and I think of myself as a teenager, and I have to put something out, even if it\u2019s only one person who listens to it while they\u2019re at the gym or something. Like, that\u2019s cool!\u201d \u2018It\u2019s a noisy world, and there\u2019s a lot of shit getting thrown at us daily. I don\u2019t want to add to that noise.\u2019 Due to the time he spent back in Ilford, by his mother\u2019s side and among his childhood haunts, memory and the formative influence of music became key catalysts for Essex Honey. Throughout the album, snippets of well-known songs act like launchpads to memories and emotions, like Proust\u2019s madeleines turned musical. On Westerberg, Hynes sings the hook from the Replacements\u2019 Alex Chilton \u2013 a sort of boomerang tribute back to Paul Westerberg \u2013 to honour the music that made him. On Mind Loaded, he sings Elliott Smith\u2019s Everything Means Nothing to Me to evoke both grief and the unifying comfort of pop melancholy. On The Field, Hynes calls in Vini Reilly to recreate the Durutti Column\u2019s Sing To Me. The references act like totems \u2013 to comfort, hope, excitement, his mother \u2013 in the same way that Sufjan\u2019s Fourth of July helped Hynes reengage with the magical potential of music that, in the midst of grief, had evaded him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThinking about being younger and listening to music was an enormous part of [this album], and so it felt like the most honest thing to do and the most natural way to do it,\u201d says Hynes of using such recognisable musical cues. \u201cGeorge Saunders, the writer, says the reason why his stories are so crazy is because he will use any device that gets the necessary emotion across. I feel the same way musically \u2013 I don\u2019t care what it is, I will do it.\u201d On Essex Honey, Hynes also finds a way to integrate the classical training he\u2019s had since youth. Songs build around orchestral improvisations and float freely like sheet music in the wind. Highlight Vivid Light \u2013 featuring woodwind bursts, an acid house break beat, and author Zadie Smith singing about writer\u2019s block \u2013 sounds like you\u2019re listening to a jam session happening in another room down the hall. \u201cYears ago I would keep [my classical work] quite separate because I was scared those connotations would overwhelm the listening experience for people \u2013 even though, in my mind, it is all just me making stuff,\u201d says Hynes. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is I\u2019m a lot looser and a lot easier on myself now, and in that sense the approach to making music has let things seep in and talk to each other. Before, I would only make things that were, quote-unquote \u2018Blood Orange\u2019. But now I trust that since it\u2019s me making it, it will turn out Blood Orange anyway.\u201d Loading Beyond Vini Reilly and Zadie Smith, Essex Honey features a who\u2019s who of cameos from Hynes\u2019 friends, including Caroline Polachek, Brendan Yates from Turnstile, Mustafa the Poet and even pop superstar Lorde. Hynes worked on Lorde\u2019s new album Virgin, playing cello, bass, guitar and synths on multiple tracks including single Man of the Year. \u201cWorking on other people\u2019s music is probably the peak of fun musically for me,\u201d says Hynes. His strength in sessions is being a pliable jack of all trades. \u201cWhen I work on someone else\u2019s music, I\u2019m completely at service to them. If they want ideas, I can give ideas. If they just want keyboards, I can give keyboards. However they want it to go, I\u2019m down, I just need to know. And then it\u2019s super fun for me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Our children are being locked up, our Elders are dying, and our people are continuing to live in a country where their rights are neglected. Their voices and calls for help falling on deaf ears.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nClosing the Gap is a national plan to improve health, education, and life expectancy for First Nations people, but only four of 19 targets are on track.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is expected to highlight progress on 10 of 15 measures at Garma, but the group says that won\u2019t resonate with struggling communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Garma Festival runs from today to the 4th of August in northeast Arnhem Land, on Yolngu country.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nAn underworld war looms in Melbourne after the daylight execution of 26-year-old Athan Boursinos, who had known links to organised crime.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe son of a former police officer, he was gunned down around 9:30am yesterday outside his home in Wollert as he was heading to court, a tactic often used by gangs to ambush rivals.\n\n\n\n\n\nEight shots were heard by neighbours.\n\n\n\n\n\nDetective Inspector Dean Thomas is with the Victoria Police.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is deliberate and obviously targeted. We will work now to piece together what has gone on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAthan Boursinos had been a person of interest in the killing of underworld figure Sam Abdul Rahim, and his death has sparked concerns of violent retaliation linked to the ongoing illicit tobacco wars.\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice says investigators are now working to prevent further bloodshed.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nRussian missile and drone attacks have killed at least 15 people and injured 155 others in Kyiv, as Russia's President defies United States President Donald Trump's ceasefire deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\nRescue crews were seen sifting through the debris following attacks on 27 locations across four Kyiv districts Thursday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior US diplomat John Kelley tells the 15-member United Nations Security Council that President Trump wants a deal to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine within one week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Both Russia and Ukraine must negotiate a ceasefire and durable peace. It is time to make a deal. President Trump has made clear this must be done by August 8. The United States is prepared to implement additional measures to secure peace.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Australians arrested by Israeli forces aboard the Freedom Flotilla boat Handala have returned safely to Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nTan Safi and Robert Martin were among 19 activists trying to breach Israel\u2019s blockade of Gaza to deliver aid including nappies and baby formula.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boat was intercepted in international waters on the 26th of July by Israeli soldiers and towed to Ashdod.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis morning, supporters greeted them at the airport waving Palestinian flags and chanting as they reunited with loved ones.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Safi describes the treatment they faced in Israeli custody, especially that of fellow activist Chris Smalls, co-founder of the Amazon Labor Union.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They pinned him down on the floor, seven or eight of them, and when i asked about him, they came into the room and dragged me out by my arms. I'm still bruised here on my arms from it. They pulled me out and threw me down on the floor, and they made me take off all my clothes. They strip searched me right there, made me, squat, up and down, and then go through all my things. And after that, maybe an hour passed, and we were able to see someone from the Australian Embassy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Handala was part of a wider Freedom Flotilla effort to raise awareness about conditions in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll foreign nationals have since been deported from Israel.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport and in swimming, Australia has won the women\u2019s four by 200 metre freestyle relay final at the World Championships in Singapore.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe victory, securing Mollie O\u2019Callaghan 11 world titles - equal to the record set by legend of the pool, fellow Australian Ian Thorpe.\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle Chalmers placed third 100 metres freestyle final at the event overnight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian came close to breaking the 46-second barrier in the race but fell just short of the mark.\n\n\n\n\n\nChalmers tells Channel 9 he is content with the result as he focuses on the arrival of his child.\n\n\n\n",

China does have some military engines it has developed itself, and its key aircraft manufacturer, Comac, is developing an engine for its C919 narrow-bodied commercial planes, but it is still heavily reliant on Boeing and Europe\u2019s Airbus for engines and parts. He could also deny \u2013 and has been denying, until recently \u2013 China\u2019s access to the most advanced US semiconductors. China isn\u2019t petrified by the prospect of extreme tariff rates, as its response to Trump\u2019s 145 per cent rate earlier this year demonstrated. Credit: Getty When Trump first slapped new tariffs on China earlier this year, China retaliated with tariff hikes of its own \u2013 and stopped allowing exports of rare earths and rare earth magnets to the US. A meeting in Sweden saw the confrontation de-escalated, with the US reducing its headline tariff rate to 30 per cent and China its rate to 10 per cent. (The headline rates are misleading because Trump added to pre-existing tariffs, dating back to his first term, and China has also been subjected to the general sectoral tariffs on commodities like steel and aluminium and products derived from them, as well as those slapped on Canada and Mexico for their claimed role in fentanyl trafficking. The Peterson Institute for International Economics puts the average US tariff on China\u2019s exports at 57.6 per cent and China\u2019s rate on US exports at 32.6 per cent).\n\nLoading There have since been a succession of 90-day extensions of the truce agreed in Stockholm and confirmed at a subsequent meeting of the trade negotiators in London which have deferred any final agreement on trade until early November. As part of that truce deal, China has allowed exports of rare earth magnets to resume, although it wasn\u2019t until July, when the volume of rare earth magnet imports from China suddenly jumped 76 per cent, that the supply regained pre-confrontation levels. China knows that its dominance of rare earths and the magnets in particular \u2013 it controls more than 70 per cent of the global supply, more than 90 per cent of the processing of rare earths and more than 90 per cent of the processing and manufacturing of rare earth permanent magnets \u2013 gives it tremendous leverage over the US. When it throttled supply of the magnets earlier this year it nearly shut down the US auto industry. The magnets are also critical to many other commercial and military applications.\n\nThe US doesn\u2019t have meaningful alternate sources of supply, although it is racing to develop some, including Defence Department funding for Australia\u2019s Lynas Rare Earths to build a separation facility in Texas. It has also arranged a $US1 billion ($1.5 billion) debt facility, $US150 million of Defence Department loans, $US400 million of equity and a 10-year floor price \u2013 at twice the current level set by China \u2013as part of guaranteed purchase commitment for 100 per cent of the output from America\u2019s only significant producer, MP Materials. While China has resumed exports of rare earth magnets to the US, for instance, it appears to be limiting sales to the US defence industry. Credit: AP There are, however, estimates that it will take 15 years and $US120 billion for the US to completely distance its rare earths supply chain from China, which developed its dominance over decades. Indeed, it ambition of dominating rare earths dates back to the 1980s. China, while it might prefer to maintain its trade with the US, isn\u2019t petrified by the prospect of extreme tariff rates, as its response to Trump\u2019s 145 per cent rate earlier this year demonstrated.\n\nLoading Since Trump first deployed tariffs against it in 2018, Xi Jinping has deliberately diversified China\u2019s range of trading partners and reduced its reliance on America for some key imports \u2013 it has, for instance, nearly halved its imports of soy beans, with Brazil displacing the US as its major supplier \u2013 while also developing alternate export markets in Asia and South America. Trump\u2019s tariffs are a crude weapon, but China\u2019s dominance of rare earths gives it the ability to use it in a highly strategic way. While it has resumed exports of rare earth magnets to the US, for instance, it appears to be limiting sales to the US defence industry. China has tightened its export controls for rare earths progressively, and recently added imports of rare earths that it processes for third parties \u2013 including MP Materials \u2013 to the continually expanding list of minerals subject to its controls and monthly monitoring. It can dial up, or down, its export quotas almost instantly and bring America\u2019s advanced manufacturing base to a near halt.\n\nWhile Trump, understandably, has tried to play down the threat posed by China\u2019s control of the market, it is clear that his administration does understand the degree of leverage it gives China. That\u2019s why it backed down from its extreme tariff rates in Stockholm and that\u2019s why it has adopted a more conciliatory tone since. Both the first Trump administration and, even more substantially the Biden administration, progressively shut semiconductors off China\u2019s access to America\u2019s most advanced semiconductors, with the ban on sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips maintained by the second Trump administration. A complete closure of US markets to China\u2019s exports would hurt China\u2019s economy, but it wouldn\u2019t destroy it. The US has a very significant edge over China in designing the most advanced chips required for artificial intelligence.",

I ask whether it puts a wet blanket on romance. \u201cAs it turns out, not,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re getting married at the end of this year. We have a child. We have a house together. We have a lovely life.\u201d Their life is so lovely that Marks says he wasn\u2019t chasing another big job after leaving Nine. \u201cI was really enjoying myself,\u201d he says. But when the ABC managing director\u2019s role became vacant, he felt the lure of higher purpose. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that it was a burning thing for me to do,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when I thought about it, I thought, no, it\u2019s important. To do something that\u2019s important \u2026 I mean, it sounds a bit righteous but it\u2019s not. Media is important. Storytelling is important. \u201cIt matters that the ABC is there as a public good \u2026 The work matters.\u201d It\u2019s Friday afternoon in Paddington and noisy chatter fills Italian restaurant Barbetta, one of Marks\u2019 favourites. He has a soft voice \u2013 his mild manner is partly what prompted his tongue-in-cheek nickname, Hollywood Hugh \u2013 and we strain to hear each other over the din. I first met Marks when he became my boss, back when he oversaw the merger between Nine (of which he was chief executive) and Fairfax Media, which owned these mastheads, in 2018. These days he\u2019s a public servant in charge of the public broadcaster, so, in a roundabout way \u2013 given I\u2019m a taxpaying member of that public \u2013 he now works for me. He orders his favourite dish, the pork chops, and I select the ragu as I brief Marks on the usual pattern of these lunchtime interviews: as the one asking the questions, I\u2019ll finish my meal, while he\u2019ll be so busy answering, he won\u2019t get a chance to eat and his food will get cold. \u201cI\u2019ll have to give one-word answers, then,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe doesn\u2019t. Marks hasn\u2019t done many profile-style interviews since he became managing director of the ABC five months ago and he\u2019s at pains to explain his approach. Many at the broadcaster still aren\u2019t quite sure what to expect. They\u2019re uncertain of his vision, or what he plans to change, or whether he\u2019ll be \u201ctoo commercial\u201d, or if he\u2019ll stand up for them when the attacks come from outside, or if he sees a future for traditional radio and terrestrial television given their declining audiences, or even if he watches, listen to and reads the ABC. They can be reassured on the last point. Marks says he has always been a fan of ABC news and current affairs. He likes Wednesday-night comedy. Friday-night dramas are a bit soft for him but he\u2019s enjoying The Family Next Door. \u201cWhen I was at Nine I could watch, listen [to] and read everything,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no way I can do that at the ABC.\u201d But he watches, reads and listens to as much as he can, and does it with his work hat on. \u201cIf you have thoughts about the direction or tone or whatever, you\u2019ve got to be thinking about all those things and talking to the teams about it,\u201d he says. Barbetta\u2019s ragu. Credit: Janie Barrett He no longer feels obliged to watch Married at First Sight, the Nine reality juggernaut that \u201cmarries\u201d two single, extroverted strangers, and is not to everyone\u2019s taste. While he has said he wants the ABC to pursue more hit shows \u2013 to find the next Bluey or MasterChef \u2013 Marks doesn\u2019t put MAFS in that category. Still, he doesn\u2019t shy away from the concept. \u201cLove on the Spectrum is a different version of the same show \u2013 still a dating show, still puts people in a reality contest,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are always different treatments of an idea.\u201d I take Marks back to the subject of dating, given it was at the centre of his departure from the top job at Nine in early 2021. It had been his second stint at the broadcaster, after working there for eight years earlier in his career as in-house legal counsel, then director of film and television, before leaving to become chief executive of Southern Star, which produced reality show Big Brother for Ten, drama Love My Way for Foxtel, and game show Deal or No Deal for Seven.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe replaced David Gyngell as Nine\u2019s chief executive in 2015. The merger he oversaw transformed Nine, creating a multi-platform company with broadcast television, streaming (Stan), publishing and radio. During that time Marks and his wife, with whom he had four children, broke up. His love life was the subject of speculation; he was photographed on a picnic with his executive assistant, who he said was an old friend. But then one of his own papers broke the story that Marks was leaving the business after he had begun a relationship with Nine\u2019s former managing director of commercial, Alexi Baker. Marks ordered the pork cutlet at Barbetta. Credit: Janie Barrett They were two consenting adults. Still, it was messy. Questions flew about who on the board was notified and when, and if there were any promotions or bonuses for Baker. Relationships involving the chief executive and a subordinate make boards nervous. There were already fractures in the board between the Nine and the Fairfax people, and the relationship exacerbated tensions. Marks says he was thinking about leaving anyway, after the merger had been bedded down. The relationship sped up his plans. \u201cIn one sense, you can deal with relationships and stuff through disclosure and all of that,\u201d he says. \u201cIn another, it creates pressures in the business that I just felt at the time was better for us to move on \u2026 to be able to pursue that relationship without the impediment of the organisation.\u201d It must be awkward to have to tell higher-ups about one\u2019s love life? \u201cIt\u2019s awkward but it\u2019s appropriate because the risk of conflict exists,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex mash of personalities and responsibilities. It\u2019s a challenge to make those decisions but it was the right decision.\u201d The story was widely reported; some of the headlines referred to it as a \u201csex scandal\u201d. I ask how he felt about the reporting, and whether he thought his relationship had been unfairly lumped into the broader category of workplace relationship scandals, particularly as it came fresh off the heels of headline-grabbers such as then federal MP Alan Tudge\u2019s affair with a staffer, who accused him of abuse, and Barnaby Joyce\u2019s relationship with his staffer, who he later married.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think in many ways it was more unfair for Alexi than me,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is, I think, a regret. There were certainly elements where we could have said more but chose not to, or where we thought it was unfair and we chose not to say something. We\u2019re comfortable with our own decisions; you have to find that in yourself.\u201d Alexi Baker and Hugh Marks at the Midwinter Ball at Parliament House last month. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen They now have a three-year-old son, Hamish, and will get married in December when Marks\u2019 adult children, two of whom live overseas, can attend. Marks is enjoying fatherhood for the fifth time. He might have more experience at parenting than his partner but he\u2019s conscious of not taking over. \u201cIt\u2019s Alexi\u2019s first child, so [I\u2019m] trying to balance that. They\u2019re such joys, children, they\u2019re so interesting as individuals.\u201d Marks is juggling fifth-time fatherhood with a big job. His experience at Nine prepared him for some elements of the role but not others. He doesn\u2019t have to answer to corporate shareholders but ABC has its own version \u2013 the viewers and staff who feel a strong sense of ownership. Changes bring a big backlash. \u201cI must say,\u201d he says, \u201cone difference between Nine and the ABC was at Nine it was always \u2018can you get rid of?\u2019 At the ABC it\u2019s more \u2018why did you get rid of?\u2019\u201d The cultures at Nine and ABC are different, too. The ABC staff is more unionised than Nine\u2019s television division, staff are public servants, there\u2019s a clear charter and a strong sense of independence from management. He\u2019ll negotiate a new enterprise agreement later this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll always be moments [of conflict],\u201d he says, \u201cbut I hope that my approach is always to engage with people on their work. There\u2019s a great sense of purpose at the ABC but if we can get them to buy into what we\u2019re doing and why, I think we can hopefully get them all to come along.\u201d Marks says he has also learnt from the exposure of the culture of sexual harassment at Nine\u2019s broadcast division, which exploded into the public eye last year but was happening while he was chief executive (he says the harassment allegations were never bought to him and were a surprise). One way to stop those cultures from developing, he says, is to keep an open dialogue with staff, and to listen as well as talk. He admits he has become better at this over the past decade, given his personal travails. \u201cMy empathy levels have also gone way up,\u201d he says. \u201cI think you do learn every time something negative happens.\u201d He is deeply interested in journalism. He is not trained as a journalist but likes to talk to journalists about their stories and provide feedback, which makes some ABC staff \u2013 who spoke to this masthead on the condition of anonymity, so they could speak freely \u2013 nervous about independence, although others like that he values their work. He also wants the ABC to break more stories with impact. This is easier said than done; every journalist wants strong stories but they don\u2019t grow on trees. Investigative journalism, in particular, is expensive. Kim Williams, ABC chair, has been in hot water for raising concerns directly with radio management about editorial decisions on comedian Sandy Gutman. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen \u201cYes, it\u2019s difficult,\u201d Marks says. \u201cOften it\u2019s just having the intellect, when you\u2019ve got a story, to challenge you on \u2026 angles and layers that you may not have thought about,\u201d he says. He sees his role as \u201can overview, looking at tone and balance, fairness, entertainment value and quality\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement",

The 50-seat corner cafe is in an old op shop two blocks from the beach and a five-minute walk from Frankston Station. It replaces a smaller Commonfolk location in the suburb.\n\nThe spacious room has a warm look with coffee-coloured Tuscan tiles, a high communal table with stools that makes a virtue of a central structural pillar, music on vinyl and big windows that promote an indoor-outdoor feel. A good way to blast yourself into the Commonfolk orbit is to order a Yin Yang coffee duo ($8) featuring their Peruvian \u201cCastle in the Sky\u201d blend. You\u2019ll get an espresso and a magic to experience the smooth, apricot-tinged chocolatey roast in two different ways.\n\nChef Kyle Noll (ex-Hatter and the Hare, Locavore Studio) is running an all-day menu that includes half-serves of many items. That hero chilli scramble is strewn with a Ugandan-style tumble of crisp spices with turtle beans and curry powder. The dish is a nod to Zukuka Bora, a Ugandan coffee producer-partner of Commonfolk since 2014. Soft scrambled eggs are layered up with that chilli, dill-infused labne, fermented garlic and preserved lemon for a certified brunch banger. Lamb shoulder with roasted beetroot would be at home in any quality bistro, and a well-constructed avo smash is boosted by green tahini and smashed chickpeas.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size All of a sudden, music felt completely insignificant to Dev Hynes. In early 2023, just as he was preparing to perform a selection of his classical works at the Sydney Opera House, his mother fell sick and was admitted to hospital. Hynes returned to his childhood home in Ilford, in Essex in England, to be by her bedside. Within two months, she had died. He cancelled the Opera House gig, and several other shows, as he took \u201ctime to grieve and focus on getting myself together\u201d. Music had been a constant in Hynes\u2019 life since childhood. He\u2019d started piano lessons at seven and cello at nine, and launched his career in the early aughts in British dance-punk phenoms Test Icicles. As Blood Orange, he\u2019d released several acclaimed solo albums and written and produced revered releases for Sky Ferreira, Solange Knowles and Carly Rae Jepsen. \u201cIt just didn\u2019t matter,\u201d recalls Hynes in a faded Iron Maiden T-shirt from his home in New York, where he\u2019s been based for 17 years. \u201cI really didn\u2019t see a point in it any more.\u201d After his mother\u2019s funeral, to get some distance from the grief of home, Hynes rented a place in Paris, just a brief rail ride from London. One day, as he was tinkering around the apartment, the algorithm served up a song he\u2019d never heard before that stopped him in his tracks. It was Sufjan Stevens\u2019 Fourth of July. \u201cI\u2019m a Sufjan fan and I\u2019m a music obsessive, but I have these crazy music holes where I just miss things, right? But this song came on and it felt like it was speaking to me. It sounded like it was inside my head,\u201d says Hynes. \u201cIt was so visceral and intense.\u201d Fourth of July is a track from Carrie & Lowell, Sufjan Stevens\u2019 harrowing album about the death of his estranged mother. At the time, Hynes knew nothing of the song\u2019s backstory. \u201cIt was quite striking to me because I didn\u2019t know the story, but it went right inside and I understood the song completely. How many mediums can do that? I\u2019m not Sufjan, but I had this feeling of wow, I can\u2019t believe my occupation is the same as the person who made this, I\u2019m involved in a pretty magical medium. And that was the drive I needed.\u201d The result is Essex Honey, Hynes\u2019 first new Blood Orange project since 2018\u2019s acclaimed Negro Swan. He\u2019d continued making music in the intervening years, including film scores for Queen & Slim (2019) and Paul Schrader\u2019s Master Gardener (2022), as well as writing and producing for hardcore stars Turnstile and Argentinian singer Nathy Peluso (for which he won a Latin Grammy in 2024). But why the break from releasing music as Blood Orange?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere was a little bit of, what\u2019s the point?\u201d admits Hynes. \u201cMusic was always being made, I never stopped, but I would think to myself: why does it need to be released? It\u2019s a noisy world, and there\u2019s a lot of shit getting thrown at us daily. I don\u2019t want to add my shit to that noise. Why would I do that?\u201d Essex Honey, the first Blood Orange album since 2018, finds Hynes looking back to his childhood. It\u2019s not the usual mindset for a successful musician. \u201cI still feel that a lot, and I have to remind myself that it\u2019s a privilege,\u201d says Hynes. \u201cI\u2019m quite lucky that, a) I know how to make music, and b) I have opportunities to release it, and c) there are people that would actually like to hear it. I think about all that and it\u2019s like, \u2018get over yourself\u2019,\u201d he laughs. That it\u2019s officially 20 years since his first professional release \u2013 Test Icicles\u2019 blog-hit Boa Vs Python came out on August 1, 2005 \u2013 has also played on Hynes\u2019 mind. \u201cI never could have dreamt, 20 years ago, that I\u2019d still be releasing albums,\u201d he says. \u201cI think of all the incredible musicians who don\u2019t have those opportunities, and I think of myself as a teenager, and I have to put something out, even if it\u2019s only one person who listens to it while they\u2019re at the gym or something. Like, that\u2019s cool!\u201d \u2018It\u2019s a noisy world, and there\u2019s a lot of shit getting thrown at us daily. I don\u2019t want to add to that noise.\u2019 Due to the time he spent back in Ilford, by his mother\u2019s side and among his childhood haunts, memory and the formative influence of music became key catalysts for Essex Honey. Throughout the album, snippets of well-known songs act like launchpads to memories and emotions, like Proust\u2019s madeleines turned musical. On Westerberg, Hynes sings the hook from the Replacements\u2019 Alex Chilton \u2013 a sort of boomerang tribute back to Paul Westerberg \u2013 to honour the music that made him. On Mind Loaded, he sings Elliott Smith\u2019s Everything Means Nothing to Me to evoke both grief and the unifying comfort of pop melancholy. On The Field, Hynes calls in Vini Reilly to recreate the Durutti Column\u2019s Sing To Me. The references act like totems \u2013 to comfort, hope, excitement, his mother \u2013 in the same way that Sufjan\u2019s Fourth of July helped Hynes reengage with the magical potential of music that, in the midst of grief, had evaded him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThinking about being younger and listening to music was an enormous part of [this album], and so it felt like the most honest thing to do and the most natural way to do it,\u201d says Hynes of using such recognisable musical cues. \u201cGeorge Saunders, the writer, says the reason why his stories are so crazy is because he will use any device that gets the necessary emotion across. I feel the same way musically \u2013 I don\u2019t care what it is, I will do it.\u201d On Essex Honey, Hynes also finds a way to integrate the classical training he\u2019s had since youth. Songs build around orchestral improvisations and float freely like sheet music in the wind. Highlight Vivid Light \u2013 featuring woodwind bursts, an acid house break beat, and author Zadie Smith singing about writer\u2019s block \u2013 sounds like you\u2019re listening to a jam session happening in another room down the hall. \u201cYears ago I would keep [my classical work] quite separate because I was scared those connotations would overwhelm the listening experience for people \u2013 even though, in my mind, it is all just me making stuff,\u201d says Hynes. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is I\u2019m a lot looser and a lot easier on myself now, and in that sense the approach to making music has let things seep in and talk to each other. Before, I would only make things that were, quote-unquote \u2018Blood Orange\u2019. But now I trust that since it\u2019s me making it, it will turn out Blood Orange anyway.\u201d Loading Beyond Vini Reilly and Zadie Smith, Essex Honey features a who\u2019s who of cameos from Hynes\u2019 friends, including Caroline Polachek, Brendan Yates from Turnstile, Mustafa the Poet and even pop superstar Lorde. Hynes worked on Lorde\u2019s new album Virgin, playing cello, bass, guitar and synths on multiple tracks including single Man of the Year. \u201cWorking on other people\u2019s music is probably the peak of fun musically for me,\u201d says Hynes. His strength in sessions is being a pliable jack of all trades. \u201cWhen I work on someone else\u2019s music, I\u2019m completely at service to them. If they want ideas, I can give ideas. If they just want keyboards, I can give keyboards. However they want it to go, I\u2019m down, I just need to know. And then it\u2019s super fun for me.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

There\u2019s a new sheriff in town, wearing Chanel instead of a gold star (they are so last season), with reports that Anna Wintour has appointed Chloe Malle as the new head of editorial content for American Vogue.\n\nAfter nearly four decades of focusing on the inscrutable gaze of outgoing editor-in-chief Wintour, with her signature sharp bob and sunglasses, designers will look to the amiable expression of Malle resting beneath corkscrew curls, for hints on whether their collection will make the pages of the enduring fashion magazine.\n\nHaving worked at Vogue since 2011, currently as editor of Vogue.com, the 39-year-old Malle has the necessary experience to sit in Wintour\u2019s chair, but it\u2019s her Hollywood pedigree that has prepared her for this close-up.\n\n\u201cThe child of Candice Bergen and the late auteur director Louis Malle, she arrives with pop culture bona fides,\u201d Puck journalist Lauren Sherman wrote in her announcement of the appointment. Bergen, the star of nineties sitcom Murphy Brown not only played a Vogue staffer in the Sex and the City series, she appeared on the magazine cover twice as a model in 1967 and 1969.",
