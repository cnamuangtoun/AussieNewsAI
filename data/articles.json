        "text": "South-east Queensland's population is set to reach 4.5 million by the time Brisbane hosts the 2032 Olympics, new analysis shows, despite rising property prices driven by a lack of supply.\n\nAnalysis of Australian Bureau of Statics data by KPMG reveals the population in the south-east corner has grown by as much as 2.2 per cent over the past five years, above the national average of 1.5 per cent.\n\n\"You've got people coming from expensive Sydney or dreary Melbourne or those small cities around the country, and also it's pulling people from places like Darwin and Cairns,\" KPMG urban economist Terry Rawnsley said.\n\nThe analysis forecasts the south-east Queensland population will be as high as five million by 2036.\n\nNew report details Brisbane economic boom The economy has tipped over $200b as population and employment continues to grow.\n\nBut not everyone is flocking to Brisbane, with more than half of the growth happening outside the state capital.\n\nIn the last five years, 68,000 new residents called the Gold Coast home, 61,000 in Logan and Beaudesert, 51,600 in Ipswich, and 47,500 more on the Sunshine Coast.\n\n\"What we are seeing in Brisbane over a long time is the inner-city suburbs have got more and more expensive, and more and more people are being pushed out to those growth areas in Ipswich and Logan,\" Mr Rawnsley said.\n\nTrinity and James McNicol have moved from Brisbane to Ipswich with space for horses and a larger house.\n\nTrinity and James McNicol made the move from the Brisbane suburb of Newmarket to Purga in Ipswich in 2021, swapping a small Queenslander for a four-bedroom house and 100 acres of farm land for a comparable price.\n\n\"We can combine what we love outside of work, still have our jobs in the city with a reasonable commute distance, but have a bit more space,\" she said.\n\n\"You have got everything at your fingertips. It is the perfect combination of having the space, the lifestyle, a bit more peace and quiet, but still having absolutely everything you need.\"\n\nInterstate migration is also driving unprecedented growth, with more than 22,000 people moving to the south-east from other cities.\n\nHowever, Mr Rawnsley said the flow of people moving from Sydney to Brisbane had started to slow over the last three years as Queensland's property prices caught up.\n\nBrisbane prices rise by almost 13pc in 12 months\n\nData from Cotality reveals unit prices in Brisbane rose by 2.2 per cent in November and house prices grew by 1.8 per cent, while property prices rose 12.8 per cent in 12 months.\n\nThe city's median home value has reached $1,015,767, which is the second highest in the country behind Sydney.\n\nHead of research Eliza Owen said the price growth was partly due to affordability and investor demand, as well as low supply levels.\n\n\"Unit values are up by about 5 per cent in the past 12 months against an 8 per cent increase in house values, so that tells us that Brisbane is a bit unique,\" she said.\n\n\"Maybe with more buyers looking to the unit market because they can get more for their money in terms of location.\"\n\nEleanor Creagh says property prices will continue to rise but at a slower rate. (Supplied)\n\nREA Group senior economist Eleanor Creagh said while prices were continuing to rise, the \"silver lining\" for those trying to buy a house was that the pace of growth was no longer accelerating relative to the same time last year.\n\n\"The supply of new housing is certainly not keeping up with the demand at the moment,\" she said.\n\n\"As a result, we are seeing that those fundamental drivers remain in play with continued upward pressure on home prices.\"",

(ABC News)\n\nLife-changing injuries sustained by students\n\nInside the bus were students from Loreto College Ballarat, who had departed their school in the early hours of the morning for a school trip.\n\nBrett Russell, now aged 63, pleaded guilty to 12 charges, including 10 counts of negligent driving causing serious injury.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors listed the injuries sustained by students in the crash, including broken bones, cognitive impairment, lacerated organs, post-traumatic stress disorder and long-term back and neck issues.\n\nAmong the most severely injured was a student, aged 15 at the time, who had to undergo a life-altering surgery.\n\nMany of the students involved in the crash, some of whom sustained severe injuries, provided victim impact statements during the trial.\n\n\"The accident has changed our lives in ways we will never fully understand,\" one victim's family told the court in their victim impact statement.\n\nAnother student, who suffered multiple bone fractures requiring surgeries, said her injuries continued to \"haunt my body every day\".\n\nDriver knew brakes were faulty\n\nThe court heard that Russell was well aware that his brakes were faulty after conversations with his workplace, and had tried testing them during the drive.\n\nWhen asked by investigators following the crash why he decided to drive despite knowing the brakes were faulty, Russell replied, \"I thought, I'll still be right.\"\n\nWhen asked what motivated him to make the trip, Russell told investigators he was \"trying to do the right thing\".\n\n\"Every night in hospital, I've thought about this. It's the only thing I can honestly say,\" he told investigators.\n\n\"The right thing, I know now, would have been not to drive the trailers.\"\n\nThe truck Brett Russell was driving eventually came to rest 400 metres from the site of the crash. (ABC News)\n\nJudge Michael O'Connell noted Russell's remorse, co-operation with investigators, and significant personal injuries sustained in the crash including a full hip replacement.\n\nHowever, he said the sentence he handed down reflected the gravity of the crimes, and the impact on the victims.\n\nRussell has already spent 230 days in pre-sentence detention, and faces a non-parole period of eight years.\n\nBorn in New Zealand, Russell will be deported upon his release.\n\nThree year saga draws to a close for students and families\n\nLoreto College principal Michelle Brodrick was one of several people connected to the school who attended the County Court on Monday to watch the sentencing.\n\nDuring the sentencing, Judge O'Connell acknowledged the immense strain on Ms Brodrick, as one of the main representatives for the victims and their families.\n\n\"[Ms Brodrick] has been the person who has had the ultimate responsibility over these last three years, to listen, to relive and to care for those involved. That has been a lot to bear,\" he said.\n\nWhen leaving court, Ms Brodrick told reporters it was an emotional and strange end to the incident.\n\n\"It's a been a long process, it's been over three years and I'm glad now that our families and our students can move on,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it will stay with me for a very long time.\"\n\nMichelle Brodrick is the principal at Loreto College in Ballarat. (ABC News)\n\nShe said the last of the students involved in the crash had now graduated Year 12, and were moving on to their next chapter in life.\n\nMs Brodrick also acknowledged the remorse of Russell following the crash.\n\n\"I do know that it's really important that truck drivers do take responsibility, and I was really glad that Brett Russell did take responsibility for what he had done from the very beginning,\" she said.",

        "text": "Engaged Australian couples nervous about their wedding day are resorting to superstitious acts to ward off wet and windy weather.\n\nOne of the acts includes burying a sausage in your garden in the lead-up to your special day, a European superstition that has gained traction in Australia thanks to social media.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhy bury a snag?\n\nThe exact origin of burying a sausage in an attempt to control the weather is not exactly clear.\n\nSome have linked the ritual to the United Kingdom and central Europe.\n\nThe rules of the burial are similarly vague; some say a raw sausage is required, others opt for cooked.\n\nThe type of sausage also appears to have no bearing on the protein's ability to impact meteorological conditions.\n\nA last resort\n\nNewlyweds Jack and Jess Luxton buried a sausage with their bridal party the night before their wedding.\n\nIt was in an attempt to thwart a torrential storm destined for their Adelaide Hills ceremony.\n\n\"One of my friends sent me a couple of TikToks and asked me if I'd heard about the trend, which I hadn't at the time,\" Ms Luxton said.\n\n\"We thought it was so funny, we had to do it.\n\n\"As we got closer and closer to the wedding, the weather forecast got worse and worse.\"\n\nJack and Jess Luxton's wedding day became the fifth wettest day of the year in the area. (Supplied: Luke John Photography)\n\nThe group ended up burying a raw sausage and then stood in a circle and chanted \"rain away\" in the style of a similarly-named Enya song.\n\n\"We eventually got to the point where we're like, well, we'll try anything,\" Mr Luxton said.\n\n\"We'd thought it's not going to work, but if we don't do this, we'll always be wondering what if we'd just buried the sausage?\"\n\nThe Luxtons had a beautiful wedding, despite the rain. (Supplied: Luke John Photography)\n\nUnfortunately for the couple, their plans for sunny skies hit a snag, and 22.2 millimetres of rain fell on their wedding day.\n\nPaying an Etsy witch\n\nNot to be outdone in their ambitions, other bridal parties have opted for an online option to keep the wild weather at bay.\n\nMany have sought out the powers of Etsy witches.\n\nThe website Etsy allows people to ask witches to cast a spell for favourable weather.

I wasn't naked, but everyone else was.\"\n\nShe said increasingly common trends include the Married At First Sight turnaround moment, the Ellen selfie, leaving empty seats for deceased loved ones, and switching the positions of the bridesmaids, groomsmen, and even which side the couple's family and friends sit on.\n\nMs Nelson said many couples no longer abide by the tradition for the groom not to look at the bride before the ceremony, and many are stepping away from having a father walk the bride down the aisle.\n\n\"People need to pick a trend based on their preference and their interests, and if it makes sense. Because a lot of trends don't make any sense at all,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm happy to go along with anything as long as both in the couple are happy with it.\"",

These interventions may include contracts, directions and, if required, more severe measures.\n\n\"Such interventions may come at a considerable cost to consumers.\"\n\nHowever, Mr Westerman said the report laid out \"extreme events\", but the government, Origin Energy and Transgrid were working collaboratively to ensure there was no disruption to consumers.",

        "text": "\"We must have a drink before the end of the year!\"\n\nDecember is a perfect storm for anyone trying to cut back on drinking. Between end-of-year deadlines, work parties, family gatherings and school events, alcohol is suddenly everywhere.\n\nIt can make drinking feel not just normal, but expected.\n\nBut if you want to drink less (or not at all) this silly season, you don't have to rely on willpower alone. Having a plan can help.\n\nSome evidence suggests when goals are focused on how you'll approach something \u2014 such as a not-drinking strategy \u2014 rather than what you'll avoid (alcohol), it's easier to follow through.\n\nSo here are some simple strategies, backed by evidence.\n\n1. Make a plan\n\nWhen making decisions, our brains tend to prioritise immediate goals over long-term ones. Scientists call this \"present bias\". This means it's harder to keep your long-term goal (cutting back on alcohol) in mind when confronted by the chance for immediate gratification (having a drink).\n\nBut if you plan when you will and won't drink in advance, you reduce the need to make this decision in real time \u2014 when alcohol is in front of you, your willpower may be lower and you're more driven by emotion.\n\nLook ahead at your calendar and choose your drinking and non-drinking days deliberately. Committing to the plan ahead of time reduces the chance of opportunistic drinking when social pressure is high.\n\nTips for moderating your alcohol intake A recent poll shows 44 per cent of Australians who drink alcohol want to drink less or stop altogether. There are strategies to help.\n\n2. Track your drinks\n\nTracking when and how much you drink is one of the most effective and well-supported strategies for reducing alcohol use and staying motivated.\n\nYou may be surprised how much tracking alone can change your drinking, simply by being more mindful and helping you understand your patterns.\n\nIt doesn't matter how you do it \u2014 in an app, a notebook or even on your phone calendar. Writing it down is better than trying to remember. And doing it consistently works best. Aim to record drinks in real time if you can.\n\nThere are lots of free, evidence-based apps, such Drink Tracker, that can help you track your drinking and drink-free days.\n\n3. Try zero-alcohol drinks\n\nFor many people, the rise of alcohol-free beer, wine and spirits has made it much easier to enjoy the ritual of drinking at social events, without the intoxication.\n\nBut they're not for everyone \u2014 particularly those who find the look, smell and taste of alcohol triggering. Know yourself, see what works, and don't force it if it's not helping reach your goals.\n\n4. Slow the pace\n\nIf your aim is to cut back, try alternating each alcoholic drink with something non-alcoholic.\n\nWater is best, but zero, low or non-alcoholic drinks can still reduce how much you drink overall \u2014 and as a bonus, they can also help you stay hydrated, which may reduce the chance of a hangover.\n\nEating something healthy and filling before and during drinking is also a good idea. It prevents rapid spikes in blood alcohol levels, as well as slowing the absorption of alcohol into your system. This means your body has a better chance of metabolising the alcohol.\n\nEating well can also help calm the cravings for sugary, fried and salty foods that are often triggered by alcohol.\n\n5. Beware of an all-or-nothing approach\n\nDon't fall into the \"goal violation\" trap (sometimes called the abstinence violation effect). That's when slipping up makes you abandon your plan altogether.\n\nMaybe someone talks you into \"just a splash\" \u2014 or one drink somehow becomes five \u2014 and you tell yourself: \"Oh well, I've blown it now.\"\n\nBut a slip is just a slip \u2014 it doesn't mean you have to give up on your goals. You can reset straight away, at the next drink or the next day.\n\n6. Set up accountability\n\nLetting a friend or partner know that you are trying to drink less helps you stay accountable and provides support \u2014 even better if they join you.\n\n7. Have responses ready\n\nPeople may notice you're not drinking or are drinking less. They may offer you a drink. Try a simple \"I'm good\" or \"I'm pacing myself tonight\". Work out what feels OK to you \u2014 you don't need to give long explanations.\n\n8. Be kind to yourself\n\nWhen you're making a big change, it won't always go smoothly. What matters is how you respond if you slip up. Shame and guilt often lead to more drinking, while self-compassion supports longer-term behaviour change.\n\nInstead of seeing a slip as failure, treat it as information: What made it hard to stick to your goals? What could help next time?\n\nDecember doesn't have to derail your goals\n\nChange comes from consistent small steps, even during the busiest month of the year. Focus on developing a relationship with alcohol that you are in control of, not the other way around.\n\nIf you are trying to make changes to your drinking, talk to your GP or check out free evidence-based resources such as Hello Sunday Morning, SMART Recovery and the Alcohol and Other Drug Hotline.\n\nKatinka van de Ven is an alcohol and other drug specialist at UNSW Sydney and Nicole Lee is an adjunct professor at the National Drug Research Institute at Curtin University.

        "text": "When Leah Wray and her family moved into a new suburb on the outskirts of Darwin in 2023, she was sold on the promise of it being a \"smart community\" with top-of-the-line underground technology.\n\nBut two years later and Ms Wray says \"ultimately it was the opposite of that\", with reports of regular internet outages and recently, the loss of free-to-air television.\n\nAnd she's not alone, with tens of thousands of residents across Australia \u2014 typically living in greenfield suburbs \u2014 experiencing similar issues.\n\nLeah Wray lives in Bellamack, where private company Opticomm owns the fibre-optic network. (ABC News: Marcus Kennedy)\n\nDecommissioning free-to-air TV technology\n\nIn Ms Wray's suburb of Bellamack and in more than 500,000 other properties across Australia, the fibre-optic network is owned by a private company called Opticomm, as opposed to the publicly owned network most Australians are familiar with \u2014 the National Broadband Network (NBN).\n\nUnlike the NBN, Opticomm not only provides the infrastructure for internet connectivity, but also the technology for each home to receive free-to-air (FTA) television over the fibre-optic network.\n\nLeah Wray says the loss of free-to-air television is \"unbelievable\". (ABC News: Marcus Kennedy)\n\nHowever, in September, Opticomm sent a letter to a subset of their customers \u2014 about 10 per cent according to Opticomm \u2014 telling them that free-to-air television would \"no longer operate over our network\".\n\nThe letter advised residents to either transition to streaming services using free-to-air apps or investigate whether they could install an antenna \u2014 both at their own cost.\n\n\"We shouldn't have been required to have any other additional costs to get our free-to-air on,\" Ms Wray said.\n\n\" We bought into this suburb knowing we would have access to free-to-air television and then suddenly its gone. \"\n\nLeah Wray says not long after receiving Opticomm's letter she came to find her television could no longer access free-to-air channels. (ABC News: Marcus Kennedy)\n\nWhile Ms Wray was eventually able to install an antenna on her home's roof for about $600, the process is not that simple for everyone.\n\nApartment residents 'left in the lurch'\n\nMike Thomas who lives with his wife in a multi-storey retirement village in Yeronga, Brisbane also received the letter from Opticomm.\n\n\"The situation that they have presented us with is very poor, and it's just not good enough,\" Mr Thomas said.\n\n\"There's a lot of people who were really left in the lurch.\"\n\nMike Thomas says Opticomm's removal of free-to-air television has been a huge blow to residents, particularly at such short notice. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)\n\nVillage Retirement Group general manager Ryan Knowles explained that as a multi-storey apartment building with senior residents, the options provided by Opticomm were not ideal.\n\nMr Knowles said installing an antenna would require the re-cabling of the entire apartment building at a huge cost.\n\n\"From people we've spoken to, it would be running into the couple hundred thousand dollars to re-cable it,\" Mr Knowles said.\n\nRyan Knowles says residents at two of his villages have lost access to free-to-air television over Opticomm's fibre-optic network. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)\n\nAs for streaming apps, Mr Knowles noted that \"not everyone in our villages has the digital acumen to handle digital tv\".\n\nTo make matters worse, despite Opticomm's letter stating the decommissioning of free-to-air would begin on October 1 with a full-shut down on February 1 2026, most residents in Yeronga and another village lost access on September 27\u2014 the day of the AFL grand final.\n\n\"To lose that at the AFL grand final afternoon was very devastating and very upsetting for the majority of residents,\" Mr Thomas said.\n\nMike Thomas describes himself as an \"avid\" watcher of sport. (ABC News: Mark Leonardi)\n\nIn a statement, an Opticomm spokesperson told the ABC the \"equipment used to receive free-to-air television\" in these communities was \"reaching end-of-life\" and \"interfering\" with other upgrades to the network.\n\nThe spokesperson said Opticomm would \"extend the availability of FTA television services\" in the NT until July 1 2027, but did not respond to the ABC's questions about what would happen to customers who had already lost access and those outside the NT.\n\nIn a statement, the Australian Communications Media Authority (ACMA) confirmed that rules around statutory infrastructure providers (SIP) such as Opticomm did \"not apply\" to the supply of FTA television, which it said was \"ultimately a commercial matter\".\n\nRegular internet issues and limited regulations\n\nBoth Mr Thomas and Ms Wray said they had issues with Opticomm's internet services, from dealing with regular \"glitches\" and loading delays to waiting four months to be connected.\n\nDozens of customers have told the ABC they too have had issues with Opticomm, including regular and lengthy outages sometimes lasting from two days to two weeks.\n\nDozens of Opticomm customers told the ABC they have experienced significant issues with their internet. (ABC News: Randi Dahnial)\n\nAn Opticomm spokesperson said in the NT the company was \"actively investing in infrastructure to improve the resilience of the network\", but did not respond to the ABC's questions about whether it was doing the same in other parts of Australia.\n\nMany customers said they have complained to their internet service provider and the Telecommunications ombudsman, but with limited success.\n\nRMIT University associate professor in engineering Mark Gregory said because the current legislation did not include \"performance standards\" for infrastructure providers, including Opticomm, ultimately regulators had \"very limited powers\" when there were \"large numbers of outages\".\n\nDr Gregory said he believed that needed to change, and a September 2025 report from the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) showed he was not the only one.\n\nCynthia Gebert says Statutory Infrastructure Providers (SIP) should be held to service quality standards, just like internet service providers are. (Supplied: TIO)\n\nIn its report, the TIO called on the federal government to develop \"service quality standards\" for statutory infrastructure providers (SIP) \"as a matter of priority\".\n\nIn a statement to the ABC, Telecommunications Ombudsman Cynthia Gebert added: \"It's not enough for a statutory infrastructure provider to have obligations to a retailer \u2013 we need clear service quality standards consumers can rely on.\"\n\nThe ABC sent questions to Federal Minister for Communications Anika Wells, who did not respond by deadline.",

Jack Fenby It\u2019s one of many dishes that Stein has collected over years of eating and cooking abroad, now making an appearance on the menu at his new Sydney restaurant, Rick Stein at Coogee Beach, which opens today, December 1. The 220-seat restaurant and bar is in the InterContinental hotel, just steps from the shoreline. \u201cThey\u2019re all dishes that I have discovered and fallen in love with on my travels around the world,\u201d he says. Like Stein himself \u2013 who has dozens of food and travel cookbooks and TV shows to his name \u2013 the menu roams widely, from a heady Singapore chilli crab to a Sri Lankan pumpkin curry with mango chutney, and a French-style lobster thermidor in a white wine cream sauce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1 / 9 Singapore blue swimmer crab.

Jack Fenby Stein\u2019s Cornish-style fish and chips are expected to be the bestseller \u2013 no surprise given the restaurant\u2019s position overlooking the beach. They\u2019re cooked in the traditional British way, in beef dripping, with chunky chips and a scoop of mushy peas. Stein is using hapuka fish. \u201cIt\u2019s a large, deep fish closely related to seabass, which is very popular in Cornwall. I like a good thick fillet of fish in fish and chips,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile tallow has recently become NSW\u2019s trendiest way to fry chips (find it at Olympic Meats and Rosie\u2019s), Stein has been doing it this way for decades. \u201cMy original enthusiasm came from a trip to Harry Ramsden\u2019s famous emporium in Guisley near Leeds in Yorkshire. I was struck by the enticing aroma that reminded me of roast beef, and I now consider dripping to be the traditional (and best) way of deep-frying.\u201d The Cornwall-style fish and chips are cooked in beef dripping. Jack Fenby Stein currently spends around three to four months of the year in Australia, dividing his time between Sydney, London and Padstow \u2013 the holiday town on Cornwall\u2019s north coast where he runs his flagship venue, The Seafood Restaurant, along with a more casual bistro, cafe, and fish-and-chip shop. On a day-to-day basis, the Sydney kitchen is run by head chef Colin Chun, a former executive chef at Hilton and Accor hotels. Stein\u2019s wife and business partner, Sarah (Sass) Stein, worked with Kate Greenwood of Studio Aria on the interiors, which carry the seafood theme into the soft furnishings. Large coastal artworks by Bridgit Thomas feature on the walls and menus, while blue patterned-style floor tiles and woven texture give the space the light, relaxed feel of a scene from Stein\u2019s Mediterranean Escapes.

        "text": "His Thanksgiving Day comments to the military were, however, greeted deliriously (and taken very seriously) by his MAGA followers on social media. And they weren\u2019t contradicted by the senior economic officials in his cabinet, despite the reality that the numbers make both his tariff dividends and the replacement of income taxes with tariffs nonsensical. Depending on the cut-off points for the dividend cheques, for instance, they would cost between about $US300 billion and $US600 billion a year. Trump\u2019s MAGA supporters shouldn\u2019t hold their breath awaiting his tariff dividends or the removal of income taxes. Credit: Bloomberg Again depending on how they were targeted (Trump has previously said taxes for those earning less than $US200,000, or about 90 per cent of US taxpayers, would initially benefit), abolishing income taxes for that group could cost something approaching $US700 billion, while completely removing individual income taxes (if it included the payroll taxes deducted from employees\u2019 wages) would cost about $2.6 trillion a year. Whatever the number might be, it would be big.\n\nUnhappily for Trump, and US taxpayers, the tariff numbers aren\u2019t as big. Loading So far this year, US Customs and Border Protection has collected about $US195 billion of tariff revenue, of which about $US118 billion relates to Trump\u2019s new tariffs. The Yale Budget Lab has estimated that, between 2026 and 2035, revenue from those tariffs will be a net $US2.3 trillion, or about $US230 billion a year. That wouldn\u2019t cover Trump\u2019s tariff dividends, let alone replace the lost revenue from taxes. Nor would the tariff revenue, as Trump has boasted it would, help to reduce US deficits and government debt, which has blown out from $US36.2 trillion to $US38.1 trillion in the 11 months since Trump regained the White House \u2013 and will blow out even more once all the measures in his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, including $US4.5 trillion of tax cuts over a decade, primarily for the wealthy, are in place from next year.\n\nWhether it\u2019s his tariff dividend, or income tax cuts, they would add (and add substantially) to US deficits and debt, not subtract from them. The rate of the tariffs could, of course, be raised to increase revenue. The average effective rate of the tariffs to date is about 17 per cent, or nearly seven times their level when Joe Biden was in the White House. The problem with that is that the higher the tariff rate, the more it is likely to discourage imports (and the tariff revenue they generate). To replace all income taxes paid by those earning below $US250,000, the average effective tariff rate on all imports would have to be about 25 per cent. To replace all individual taxes (about half of all government revenue), the rate would need to exceed 70 per cent. There\u2019d be few, if any, imports \u2013 or tariff revenue \u2013 at that point. The other challenge to the maths is that the headline amounts of revenue being collected from tariffs overstates their net benefit to the government\u2019s income.\n\nContrary to Trump\u2019s assertion (his economic spokespeople tend to prevaricate when questioned on this subject), tariffs are paid for by US companies, and ultimately by US consumers. They are a tax on businesses and consumption and, by reducing the incomes available to businesses, their shareholders or households, the tariffs also shrink the tax base. The US Tax Foundation says that tariff revenue should be discounted by between 23 and 25 per cent. Because they flow through to US companies and ultimately households via higher prices for goods (most estimates are that exporters, once the regime settles, will absorb only between about 5 and 15 per cent of their cost), they are also highly regressive. Contrary to Trump\u2019s assertion, tariffs are paid for by US companies \u2013 and ultimately by US consumers. Credit: Bloomberg Lower income households spend more of their income on necessities than wealthy households.\n\nThe US income tax system is progressive, albeit that its tax rates are far lower than in most developed economies, so its tax system would be switching from one that is progressive to one where the lower income households shouldered most of the burden of funding the government. Higher income households, already set to benefit massively from the One Big Beautiful Bill, would be even better off if tariff revenues were substituted for at least some of their income tax. Trump\u2019s promises disappear as their impossibility becomes clear to him and a cabinet which, while generally unwilling to challenge anything Trump says or does, has at least one or two who can probably add up. Trump\u2019s proposed abolition of income taxes (while handing out tariff dividends and slashing government debt) is, of course, a fantasy. Either he doesn\u2019t know that (just as he doesn\u2019t seem to know that tariffs on China\u2019s exports aren\u2019t paid by China) or he is deliberately and cynically misleading his MAGA base for political gain, with his cabinet and congressional Republicans happy to go along with him.",

We do need to make sure we continue to be prepared and not just to assume that it's going to be something that gets milder and milder,\" Griffin said.\n\n\n\nSome other experts believe the current COVID-19 pattern will continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine Bennett, chair in epidemiology at Deakin University, told SBS News the COVID-19 situation in the previous summer was \"one of the least detectable waves\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was a bit of a rise over the summer period, that probably coincided with some people travelling to the northern hemisphere, where they were going through a winter wave,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of 27 November, 6,524 COVID-19 cases had been reported in November, according to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, an almost 11 per cent decrease from October.\n\n\n\n\n\nBennett said she thinks Australia could see more COVID activity but it \"thankfully won't be like our winter waves\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's probably, hopefully, going to be like last year [where] there's no distinct wave where suddenly there's a lot more people sick, but there's just signs of more activity.\"\n\n\n\nBennett said the COVID-19 summer waves in Australia have faded away somewhat over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of it's to do with our natural immunity maturity,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With the virus circulating in the community without getting really sick, people are still boosting their immunity.\"\n\n\n\nPeople with health conditions should be prepared\n\nBut with a new COVID-19 wave or just increased activity, experts agree vulnerable people should be better prepared for the holiday season.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Department of Health, people aged 65 or older, pregnant women, and those with specific conditions such as a weakened immune system, neurological disease, chronic lung disease, heart disease, obesity, diabetes and chronic kidney disease are at \"a higher risk of becoming very sick from COVID-19\".\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople over 75 are recommended to receive two booster doses per year, and those over 18 with a weakened immune system can consider a second dose.\n\n\n\n\n\nBennett said now is the time these people should be considering a second dose due to the increase in activities over the summer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Having a dose now and then, having another one, in May before we go into the winter wave, which is usually a bit more substantial, that's probably the timing that will give them the best benefit,\" she said.\n\n\n\nRemaining home while having symptoms and wearing masks remain inseparable ways of fighting COVID-19, Bennett said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're unwell at Christmas and the whole family's getting together, all the generations, it's better for the family if you don't go,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Putting on a mask just helps you not ruin someone else's Christmas or worse, pass the virus onto someone else who might be more vulnerable to severe illness.\"\n\n\n\nFlu on the rise\n\nWhile the next days and weeks will determine the situation of the COVID-19 cases in Australia, another respiratory disease is at unseasonably elevated levels in some parts of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 1 January until this week, the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System reported 1,713 Australians per 100,000 were infected with the flu, making it the highest year on record.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of Thursday, over 456,000 Australians have been diagnosed with flu, and more than 52,000 of those infections were in kids under four.\n\n\n\n\n\nGriffin said this is \"definitely not usual\".\n\n\n\n\"We saw high numbers of interseasonal flu cases at the start of the year, and we continue to see more flu than we might expect, given that we're past the peak period that we normally see in the cooler time of the year,\" Griffin said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This year, we're going to probably surpass all records for flu cases and maybe even exceed 500,000 cases.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month NSW health authorities said: \"Influenza is stable at a moderate level of activity and is driven predominantly by influenza A. This sustained activity is unusual for this time of year.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Royal Australian College of General Practitioners reports this year, only 25 per cent of Australian children aged six months to five years received vaccinations \u2014 the lowest level since 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd at least 60 per cent of those aged 65 and over were vaccinated, marking the lowest level since 2020.\n\n\n\n",

So, mature-age women that want to earn a bit more money tax free to go back into - so retired childcare professionals - go back into the system, because having that maturity and that wisdom in a facility, they can spot signs and they can train up people and mentor people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is also trialling the use of CCTV in centres and introducing a national register of childcare workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Melbourne childcare worker Joshua Brown, who worked at 24 centres, was charged with sexually abusing eight children under the age of two.\n\n\n\n\n\nQueensland's Liberal National Party has claimed victory in the Hinchinbrook by-election in North Queensland, with a large swing against the incumbent Katter's Australia Party.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith most of the first preferences counted, the LNP's Wayde Chiesa has more than 40 per cent of the vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Katter Australia Party had 30 per cent, and One Nation just over 13 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe by-election was triggered by the resignation of Nick Dametto, who left parliament to successfully contest the Townsville mayoral race.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 200 firefighters are working to contain a massive blaze at a waste facility factory in Sydney's west.\n\n\n\n\n\nA huge fire ball erupted, sending flames up to 150 metres into the sky above the St Mary's site, as flames took hold around 11pm last night [[Saturday]].\n\n\n\n\n\nA large chemical tank was also blown into the air.\n\n\n\n\n\nFire Rescue New South Wales Commissioner, Jeremy Fewtrell, says firefighters have been doing an amazing job.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got 50 fire trucks here of various types. We've got lots of fire engines and other specialist vehicles. We've got five aerial appliances at work, and so they're the water towers working above and across the scene and putting large volumes of water on to the fire.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cause of the fire is unknown but it's expected to burn for most of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands of people have paid their respects for the victims of an apartment complex fire in Hong Kong, marking the start of three days of official mourning.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople gathered to lay flowers at a small park near the burnt remains of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po to honour at least 128 people killed when the fire broke out and spread to seven towers.\n\n\n\n\n\nForty people remain in hospital, 19 in a critical condition. ]]\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorities have now arrested 11 people in connection to renovation work at the towers, with suggestions foam boards and bamboo scaffolding accelerated the fire's spread.\n\n\n\n\n\nTifa Cheng's mother lost her home in the blaze, and says residents tried to warn authorities of the risks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s really frustrating because we felt something was wrong from the start, but it seemed no one listened to us. And now this incident happened, costing the lives of residents. It\u2019s infuriating. For now, we\u2019ll wait for the neighbors to settle things. I don\u2019t know if there will be further investigations or follow-ups.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter more than a decade of planning and construction, Melbourne's $15 billion Metro Tunnel rail line opens today.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe service will stop at five new underground stations that feature platform screen doors and shops.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 9 kilometre twin tunnels will open to limited services from today in an initial \"soft start\", with train fanatics and curious locals queuing to ride its maiden trip.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in sport\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Melbourne have won the AFLW grand final with a massive 40-point win over the Brisbane Lions, becoming the first team to win back-to-back premierships.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsh Riddell starred in the Kangaroos' 56 to 16 triumph at Melbourne's Ikon park with 39 disposals, the highest tally ever recorded in a season-decider.\n\n\n\n",

The statement points to values including freedom of the individual, freedom of religion, commitment to the rule of law, and equality. Permanent applicants have an additional statement regarding a commitment to learning the English language.\n\n\n\nEnglish language tests under scrutiny\n\nSeparately, one of the men in charge of formulating the Coalition's policy, opposition home affairs spokesman Jonno Duniam, said it could include a new test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are looking at how best to assess someone's commitment to our country \u2026 and there are a range of ways of doing that, and it may be that, of course, a condition on a visa might be one of those things that we inquire about, or revisiting the citizenship test,\" he told News Corp on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also reportedly flagged the strengthening of English language requirements for foreign students, if the Coalition won the next election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the requirements, the standards of these tests, do need to be improved,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLey would not confirm the statements from Duniam when asked by Sky News, but flagged the party policy would be unveiled before the end of the year.\n\n\n\nFeeding racism: Greens senator criticises values test idea\n\nGreens senator Mehreen Faruqi criticised a proposed values test, saying it was \"the ultimate dog whistle.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can't say migrants aren't a problem and then call for a values screening test to demonise and other them,\" she said on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is what is feeding the rising racism in this country.\"\n\n\n\nThe Coalition faced criticism earlier this year after comments made by Northern Territory senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My criticism of this government around migration policy is \u2026 not a criticism of any migrant or migrant community,\" Ley said earlier on Sunday..\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a massive failing of governments to build the infrastructure that our communities need, and they're rightly concerned about that.\"\n\n\n\n",

Jack Fenby It\u2019s one of many dishes that Stein has collected over years of eating and cooking abroad, now making an appearance on the menu at his new Sydney restaurant, Rick Stein at Coogee Beach, which opens today, December 1. The 220-seat restaurant and bar is in the InterContinental hotel, just steps from the shoreline. \u201cThey\u2019re all dishes that I have discovered and fallen in love with on my travels around the world,\u201d he says. Like Stein himself \u2013 who has dozens of food and travel cookbooks and TV shows to his name \u2013 the menu roams widely, from a heady Singapore chilli crab to a Sri Lankan pumpkin curry with mango chutney, and a French-style lobster thermidor in a white wine cream sauce.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1 / 9 Singapore blue swimmer crab.

An ice bar displays Pambula, Port Stephens and Merimbula rock oysters, alongside fillets of salmon, kingfish, tuna and scallops, ready to be sliced and arranged on Stein\u2019s sashimi plate.

Jack Fenby Stein\u2019s Cornish-style fish and chips are expected to be the bestseller \u2013 no surprise given the restaurant\u2019s position overlooking the beach. They\u2019re cooked in the traditional British way, in beef dripping, with chunky chips and a scoop of mushy peas. Stein is using hapuka fish. \u201cIt\u2019s a large, deep fish closely related to seabass, which is very popular in Cornwall. I like a good thick fillet of fish in fish and chips,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile tallow has recently become NSW\u2019s trendiest way to fry chips (find it at Olympic Meats and Rosie\u2019s), Stein has been doing it this way for decades. \u201cMy original enthusiasm came from a trip to Harry Ramsden\u2019s famous emporium in Guisley near Leeds in Yorkshire. I was struck by the enticing aroma that reminded me of roast beef, and I now consider dripping to be the traditional (and best) way of deep-frying.\u201d The Cornwall-style fish and chips are cooked in beef dripping. Jack Fenby Stein currently spends around three to four months of the year in Australia, dividing his time between Sydney, London and Padstow \u2013 the holiday town on Cornwall\u2019s north coast where he runs his flagship venue, The Seafood Restaurant, along with a more casual bistro, cafe, and fish-and-chip shop. On a day-to-day basis, the Sydney kitchen is run by head chef Colin Chun, a former executive chef at Hilton and Accor hotels. Stein\u2019s wife and business partner, Sarah (Sass) Stein, worked with Kate Greenwood of Studio Aria on the interiors, which carry the seafood theme into the soft furnishings. Large coastal artworks by Bridgit Thomas feature on the walls and menus, while blue patterned-style floor tiles and woven texture give the space the light, relaxed feel of a scene from Stein\u2019s Mediterranean Escapes.

Jack Fenby\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStein\u2019s favourite place to sit is the 10-seat kitchen table. \u201cI like a bit of theatre, and often go for bar stool-style seating, in this case, by our Ice Bar, where I can watch the chefs in action.\u201d He\u2019s equally fond of \u201cThe Snug\u201d, the semi-private dining nook beside the bar, which displays some of his best-selling cookbooks and his Coves of Cornwall ceramics, all available to buy. The dining room is fronted by glass bi-fold doors that open in good weather, bringing diners even closer to the beach. Open Mon to Thu 6pm until late; Fri, Sat and Sun 12pm until late.

        "text": "His Thanksgiving Day comments to the military were, however, greeted deliriously (and taken very seriously) by his MAGA followers on social media. And they weren\u2019t contradicted by the senior economic officials in his cabinet, despite the reality that the numbers make both his tariff dividends and the replacement of income taxes with tariffs nonsensical. Depending on the cut-off points for the dividend cheques, for instance, they would cost between about $US300 billion and $US600 billion a year. Trump\u2019s MAGA supporters shouldn\u2019t hold their breath awaiting his tariff dividends or the removal of income taxes. Credit: Bloomberg Again depending on how they were targeted (Trump has previously said taxes for those earning less than $US200,000, or about 90 per cent of US taxpayers, would initially benefit), abolishing income taxes for that group could cost something approaching $US700 billion, while completely removing individual income taxes (if it included the payroll taxes deducted from employees\u2019 wages) would cost about $2.6 trillion a year. Whatever the number might be, it would be big.\n\nUnhappily for Trump, and US taxpayers, the tariff numbers aren\u2019t as big. Loading So far this year, US Customs and Border Protection has collected about $US195 billion of tariff revenue, of which about $US118 billion relates to Trump\u2019s new tariffs. The Yale Budget Lab has estimated that, between 2026 and 2035, revenue from those tariffs will be a net $US2.3 trillion, or about $US230 billion a year. That wouldn\u2019t cover Trump\u2019s tariff dividends, let alone replace the lost revenue from taxes. Nor would the tariff revenue, as Trump has boasted it would, help to reduce US deficits and government debt, which has blown out from $US36.2 trillion to $US38.1 trillion in the 11 months since Trump regained the White House \u2013 and will blow out even more once all the measures in his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, including $US4.5 trillion of tax cuts over a decade, primarily for the wealthy, are in place from next year.\n\nWhether it\u2019s his tariff dividend, or income tax cuts, they would add (and add substantially) to US deficits and debt, not subtract from them. The rate of the tariffs could, of course, be raised to increase revenue. The average effective rate of the tariffs to date is about 17 per cent, or nearly seven times their level when Joe Biden was in the White House. The problem with that is that the higher the tariff rate, the more it is likely to discourage imports (and the tariff revenue they generate). To replace all income taxes paid by those earning below $US250,000, the average effective tariff rate on all imports would have to be about 25 per cent. To replace all individual taxes (about half of all government revenue), the rate would need to exceed 70 per cent. There\u2019d be few, if any, imports \u2013 or tariff revenue \u2013 at that point. The other challenge to the maths is that the headline amounts of revenue being collected from tariffs overstates their net benefit to the government\u2019s income.\n\nContrary to Trump\u2019s assertion (his economic spokespeople tend to prevaricate when questioned on this subject), tariffs are paid for by US companies, and ultimately by US consumers. They are a tax on businesses and consumption and, by reducing the incomes available to businesses, their shareholders or households, the tariffs also shrink the tax base. The US Tax Foundation says that tariff revenue should be discounted by between 23 and 25 per cent. Because they flow through to US companies and ultimately households via higher prices for goods (most estimates are that exporters, once the regime settles, will absorb only between about 5 and 15 per cent of their cost), they are also highly regressive. Contrary to Trump\u2019s assertion, tariffs are paid for by US companies \u2013 and ultimately by US consumers. Credit: Bloomberg Lower income households spend more of their income on necessities than wealthy households.\n\nThe US income tax system is progressive, albeit that its tax rates are far lower than in most developed economies, so its tax system would be switching from one that is progressive to one where the lower income households shouldered most of the burden of funding the government. Higher income households, already set to benefit massively from the One Big Beautiful Bill, would be even better off if tariff revenues were substituted for at least some of their income tax. Trump\u2019s promises disappear as their impossibility becomes clear to him and a cabinet which, while generally unwilling to challenge anything Trump says or does, has at least one or two who can probably add up. Trump\u2019s proposed abolition of income taxes (while handing out tariff dividends and slashing government debt) is, of course, a fantasy. Either he doesn\u2019t know that (just as he doesn\u2019t seem to know that tariffs on China\u2019s exports aren\u2019t paid by China) or he is deliberately and cynically misleading his MAGA base for political gain, with his cabinet and congressional Republicans happy to go along with him.",

Credit: Getty Images\n\nEstimates of the value of a sale - based around the concept of selling 49 per cent stakes in six clubs and 100 per cent stakes in one each of the two Melbourne and Sydney-based teams - have ranged between $600 and $800 million.\n\nBut the strategic imperative of budget repair ahead of the next round of domestic broadcast deals in five years\u2019 time has been a key focus of negotiation between CA chief executive Todd Greenberg, the state associations and the players.",
