Ellen* was looking for love.\n\nAll three took part in in multi-level marketing (MLM) businesses\ufeff that they say left them in financial or emotional ruin.\n\nAnd they're not alone.\n\nREAD MORE: The faces of the Texas flood tragedy\n\nSabrina wanted to make some extra cash but ended up broke. (Supplied)\n\nThere are about 300,000 MLM consultants in Australia, according to Direct Selling Australia (DSA) \u2013 about 80 per cent of them women. MLMs are legal in Australia but research shows most consultants will only lose money.\n\n\ufeffThe industry has also been plagued with allegations of \"toxic\" culture and unethical business practices for years.\n\nYet more than 90,000 Aussies joined MLMs in 2023 alone, many just trying to make ends meet.\n\n\"They prey on vulnerable people, they offer hope in this financial crisis\ufeff,\" Ellen told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"It's all a lie.\"\n\nHave you got a story? Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nWhat is multi-level marketing\ufeff?\n\nMLM businesses, also known as direct selling or network marketing, work by recruiting individual salespeople or \"consultants\".\n\nBut they don't receive a salary or wages.\n\nInstead, they make money by selling MLM products, which they must purchase themselves from the business then sell at a markup or through recruitment.\n\nConsultants can make hefty bonuses \ufeffby recruiting other consultants under them (known as their \"downline\") to earn a percentage on all those recruits' sales.\n\nThis model, popularised by brands like Avon and Tupperware, has been compared to those of illegal pyramid schemes but MLMs are \ufefflegal under Australian Consumer Law because they offer tangible products.\n\nBut fewer than one per cent of MLM consultants make a profit, according to US research , and a slew of MLMs have been accused of unethical sales and recruitment \ufefftactics.\n\nConsultants predominantly \ufeffsell and recruit through their personal networks, targeting friends, family and social media connections to buy or join.\n\nAnd most MLMs require \ufeffconsultants to make regular purchases and meet sales \ufefftargets just to stay in the business.\n\nSo why would someone ever join?\ufeff\n\nLured in\n\nSabrina was working as a travel agent in Queensland when an old friend suggested she join \ufeffskincare MLM NuCerity.\n\nShe promised it would help Sabrina achieve financial freedom and be her own boss.\ufeff\n\n\"I was doing a lot of overtime and she started telling me how it would be a great way to eventually get some time freedom,\" Sabrina told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"I signed up straight away.\"\ufeff\n\nShe believed her friend had her best interests in mind and ignored some red flags, \ufefflike when other consultants allegedly told her not to Google the business.\n\n\ufeff\"I trusted her, so I didn't really question anything,\" Sabrina said.\n\nSabrina \"didn't question anything\" when an old friend recruited her into an MLM business. (Supplied)\n\nHad she Googled NuCerity, Sabrina might have found warnings not to join the MLM that left her broke and emotionally \"shattered\".\n\n\ufeffSabrina was with NuCerity for four years but never made more than a few hundred dollars a month, even after quitting her job to focus on the MLM.\n\nAny money she did make was spent on NuCerity products to stay in the business, so she had to rely on her then-partner to cover rent, bills and groceries.\n\nNuCerity has since gone out of business. It was acquired by ARIIX , which has also gone out of business and in turn was acquired by NewAge. All three companies have not responded to a request for comment.\n\nSingle mum Ellen was convinced to join a health product MLM by a man she met on a dating app who swore it would be the \"perfect side hustle\" on top of her nursing job.\n\nShe hoped to make extra cash and was involved with a string of MLMs over the next few years but lost thousands.\n\n\"This has really f----- me over emotionally and financially,\ufeff\" she said tearfully.\n\nOther former consultants told 9news.com.au they were recruited into MLMs by friends and relatives who promised they could earn easy money and work from home.\n\nMost said they \ufeffonly believed the claims because of their relationship with the recruiter.\ufeff\n\n'Is this a cult?'\ufeff\n\nChloe, from Perth, was sceptical when local mums started joining a beauty MLM but was eventually recruited by a relative.\n\nThough she made $6000 in less than a year, she said the toxic and \"cult-like\" behaviour she witnessed \ufeffin the MLM shocked her.\n\n\ufeff\"Not only did I witness most mums losing money but the emotional and spiritual abuse was like nothing I'd seen before,\" Chloe said.\n\nShe alleged other consultants bullied and harassed new recruits, manipulated them into paying for their own training courses and \"shut down\" anyone who challenged them.\n\nWhen 9news.com.au reached out to the health MLM it said it took \"allegations of bullying and harassment extremely seriously but strongly rejects any allegations that misrepresent our business model, culture, or the safety of our products.\"\n\nSabrina alleged she was encouraged by NuCerity consultants to spend beyond her means to maintain the image of success even when she was scraping by.\n\nShe claimed that when she questioned these tactics, she was \"gaslit\" into believing she was the problem.\n\n\"It's incredible how these groups can just brainwash you,\" she said.\n\n\"My auntie even asked me, 'Is this a cult?'\"\n\nIt certainly felt like one to Ellen, who only stayed in the MLM industry for so long because she craved a sense of community.\ufeff\n\nMost MLMs encourage consultants to connect and form groups, offering a sense of connection to vulnerable and isolated individuals.\n\n\"I'm very isolated socially and I felt like I belonged\ufeff,\" Ellen said, but it soured quickly.\n\n\"They pretend to be your friend [but] they just close ranks and shut you out if you don't do exactly what they say.\"\n\n'The women who join are not dumb or na\u00efve'\n\nFormer consultants alleged they were encouraged to target vulnerable people \ufeffto boost sales and recruitment.\n\n\"We were encouraged to find a niche \u2013 burnt-out nurses, or menopausal women, or single mums \u2013 and infiltrate,\" Ellen claimed.\n\n\"To join all these Facebook groups, then start offering [MLM products] on the sly.\"\n\nSabrina and two other NuCerity consultants went a step further, starting their own Facebook group to lure other women into the MLM.\n\nAdvertised as a group for women to make friends, they used it to identify and connect with potential targets.\n\n\"We started organising weekend coffees under the pretence of wanting to connect and make friends ... we were really sneaky, to be honest,\" Sabrina said.\n\nThen they tried to sell to or recruit the women, many of whom had limited social or support networks.\ufeff\n\nChloe said that mothers in her local area were prime targets, as many were socially isolated and craved connection with other women.\n\n\"The women who join are not dumb or na\u00efve,\" she said.\n\n\"They are being recruited by their best friends, sisters, mums, aunties, work colleagues, people they know, like and trust ... and it's not simple to leave.\"\n\nLeaving isn't easy\ufeff\n\nWhen Sabrina finally left NuCerity it was because she couldn't afford the $200 minimum monthly spend to stay in the business.\n\nAs soon as that happened, the consultants she'd called friends cut her off.\n\n\ufeff\"Everything just started crumbling. I completely lost my self-esteem, I was very depressed,\" she said.\n\nIt took months to recover financially and emotionally, and years to come clean to members of the Facebook group\ufeff she had started (after the other consultants left).\n\nShe now runs it solely to foster friendships and protect other women.\n\nSabrina now educates other Australians about the financial and personal risks of MLMs. (Supplied)\n\nEllen struggled for years before finally escaping the MLM industry after saying she said she realised it was \"all smoke and mirrors\".\n\n\"It's a lot of manipulation, you're most likely not going to succeed, you're most likely going to lose a hell of a lot of friends and family,\" she said.\n\nShe's suffered mental health issues as a result and is still thousands of dollars out of pocket.\ufeff\n\nSabrina, Chloe and Ellen now spend their free time educating other Australians about the financial and personal risks of MLMs in the hopes that other women don't fall into the same trap.\n\n\"They are not providing an opportunity for mums and vulnerable people,\" Chloe said.\n\n\"It's a model where only one per cent earn a decent income and the rest lose money.\"\n\nSabrina added that Australians who leave MLMs shouldn't feel ashamed \ufeffto share their stories, as they can help others find the motivation to get out of a bad situation.\n\nShe, Chloe and Ellen called for better financial education for vulnerable groups and greater government protections and support for people who lose money in MLMs.\n\n*Names changed for privacy.\ufeff",

The price crushed the previous auction record for a handbag \u2014 $513,040 paid in 2021 for a Herm\u00e8s White Himalaya Niloticus Crocodile Diamond Retourne Kelly 28.\n\nNow, the original Birkin bag, named after the actor, singer and fashion icon that Herm\u00e8s created it for \u2014 the late Jane Birkin \u2014 is in a new league of its own. Only one fashion item has sold at auction for more: a pair of ruby red slippers from The Wizard of Oz , which sold for $US32.5 million ($49.43 million) in 2024, Sotheby's said.\n\nREAD MORE: Driver yet to speak to police after car hits pedestrian trio in fatal crash\n\nThe winning bid of \u20ac7 million drew gasps and applause from the audience. (AP)\n\nThe bag became so famous that Jane Birkin once mused before her death in 2023 at age 76 that her obituaries would likely \"say, 'Like the bag' or something\". (AP)\n\nWhistles in the auction room\n\nThe Paris auction room buzzed with anticipation as the sale got under way, with the auctioneer reminding the crowd that the bag was \"totally unique\" and \"the most famous bag of all time\".\n\nThe bidding started at \u20ac1 million but quickly increased, with telephone bidders fighting it out at the end. With Sotheby's fees included, the total price for the winning bidder from Japan was a cool \u20ac8.6 million, the auction house said.\n\nFrom the starting price, bids rocketed past \u20ac2 million, then \u20ac3 million, \u20ac4 million and \u20ac5 million, to astonished gasps. When the price jumped from \u20ac5.5 million to \u20ac6 million in one swoop, there were whistles and applause.\n\nThe final bids were \u20ac6.2 million, then \u20ac6.5 million, then \u20ac6.8 million before the Japanese buyer's last winning bid: \u20ac7 million.\n\nThe price crushed the previous auction record for a handbag \u2014 $513,040 paid in 2021 for a Herm\u00e8s White Himalaya Niloticus Crocodile Diamond Retourne Kelly 28. (AP)\n\nSotheby's didn't identify the buyer. Nine collectors bidding by telephone, online, and in the room competed in the 10-minute auction battle, with the private collector from Japan beating a last remaining other bidder at the end.\n\n'One of a kind'\n\nParis fashion house Herm\u00e8s exclusively commissioned the bag for the London-born Birkin in 1984 \u2014 branding it with her initials JB on the front flap, below the lock \u2014 and delivered the finished one-of-a-kind bag to her the following year, Sotheby's said. The subsequent commercialized version of Birkin's bag went on to become one of the world's most exclusive luxury items, extravagantly priced and with a yearslong waiting list.\n\nThe bag was born of a fortuitous encounter on a London-bound flight in the 1980s with the then-head of Herm\u00e8s, Jean-Louis Dumas. Birkin recounted in subsequent interviews that the pair got talking after she spilled some of her things on the cabin floor.\n\nBirkin asked Dumas why Herm\u00e8s didn't make a bigger handbag and sketched out on an airplane vomit bag the sort of hold-all that she would like. He then had an example made for her and, flattered, she agreed when Herm\u00e8s asked whether it could commercialise the bag in her name.\n\nParis fashion house Herm\u00e8s exclusively commissioned the bag for the London-born Birkin in 1984 \u2014 branding it with her initials JB on the front flap, below the lock. (AP)\n\n\"There is no doubt that the Original Birkin bag is a true one-of-a-kind \u2014 a singular piece of fashion history that has grown into a pop culture phenomenon that signals luxury in the most refined way possible. It is incredible to think that a bag initially designed by Herm\u00e8s as a practical accessory for Jane Birkin has become the most desirable bag in history,\" said Morgane Halimi, Sotheby's head of handbags and fashion.\n\nThe bag became so famous that Birkin once mused before her death in 2023 at age 76 that her obituaries would likely \"say, 'Like the bag' or something\".\n\n\"Well, it could be worse,\" she added.\n\nHeight of French chic\n\nSotheby's said that seven design elements on the handcrafted all-black leather prototype set it apart from Birkins that followed.\n\nIt's the only Birkin with a nonremovable shoulder strap \u2014 fitting for the busy life and practicality of the singer, actor, social activist and mother who was also known for her romantic relationship with French singer Serge Gainsbourg and their duets that included the steamy 1969 song Je t'aime moi non plus ( I Love You, Me Neither ).\n\nHer bag also had a nail clipper attached, because Birkin \"was never one for long painted nails,\" Sotheby's said.\n\nAuction officer Aur\u00e9lie Vandevoorde gestures to the Birkin. (AP)\n\nThe bag that Herm\u00e8s handmade for her, developed off its existing Haut A Courroies model, also has gilded brass hardware, bottom studs and other features that differ from commercial Birkins.\n\nBirkin's casual, breezy style in the 1960s and early 1970s \u2014 long hair with bangs, jeans paired with white tops, knit minidresses and basket bags \u2014 still epitomizes the height of French chic for many women around the world.\n\n'More than just a bag'\n\nWhen Birkin chatted to Herm\u00e8s' Dumas on the Paris-to-London flight about what her ideal handbag would be, she'd been in the habit of carrying her things around in a wicker basket, because she felt handbags in the 1980s were too small, Sotheby's said. She was traveling with her young daughter, Charlotte, and complained that she couldn't find a bag suitable for her needs as a mother, Herm\u00e8s says.\n\nHerm\u00e8s later gifted her four other Birkin bags. She kept the prototype for nearly a decade, before auctioning it for an AIDS charity in 1994. It was auctioned again in 2000 and had since been in private hands.\n\nAn electronic board shows the bid after the original Birkin bag created by Herm\u00e8s for Jane Birkin was sold. (AP)\n\nThe previous owner, who identified herself only as Catherine B, told journalists at the auction that the bag \"has all the attributes of a star.\"\n\n\"The price is the price of the Herm\u00e8s story,\" she said.\n\nSotheby's called it \"more than just a bag\".\n\n\"The Birkin has evolved from a practical accessory to become a timeless cultural icon,\" it said.",

You never ordered them.\n\nYet, the shipping spree to your street continues for more than a year. That's what happened to a woman in San Jose, California.\n\nHer frustrating scenario is linked to an overseas online seller who appears to be violating Amazon's return policy.\n\nIt's an Amazon nightmare. Imagine hundreds of oversized packages appear on your doorstep -- and you have no clue why. You never ordered them. (CNN)\n\n\"Kay\" (not her real name) is utterly confused as to why scores of these large boxes filled with car seat covers keep appearing at her doorstep. She says it's non-stop.\n\nThe mystery \"shipping spree\" is now haunting half of her car port.\n\n\"What you see now is a fraction, because I have refused delivery on more packages than you see here,\" Kay said.\n\nInside each package is a set of faux-leather car seat covers from a Chinese online seller called \"Liusandedian.\"\n\nThe online seller's Amazon listing advertises the brand Etkin, selling seat covers supposedly made to fit various makes and models of sedans and SUVs.\n\nBut as you can see from Kay's house, the covers didn't fit and consumers said they were forced to pay out of pocket to return them to the company's \"return centre\".\n\nOne person commented online: \"Why haven't I received my refund? Was sent thru UPS 3 weeks ago.\"\n\nYet, little do they know - they're just piling up in Kay's garage.\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump blindsides seven more nations with tariff letters\n\nKay says she's contacted Amazon countless times to try and resolve this over the past year, including filing six complaint tickets. (AP)\n\nIn part because the online seller put Kay's address on their return labels, leaving her stuck in this mess.\n\nMeanwhile, reviews indicate consumers are stuck without their refunds. In one case, a viewer wrote: \"It's going to cost me $US124 ($189) to return this item!!!\" - an item that she already paid at least $US129 for.\n\n\"Oftentimes, what it costs to return it is about more than 50 per cent of what they paid for it,\" Kay said. \"Plus, these consumers aren't getting their money back!\"\n\nKay says she's contacted Amazon countless times to try and resolve this over the past year, including filing six complaint tickets.\n\n\"And every time I was absolutely assured this will stop... you won't get any more of these packages, you'll hear from us in 24, 48 hours...\" Kay said she was even offered a $US100 Amazon gift balance.\n\nNope.

        "text": "United States President Donald Trump has announced plans to impose a 50 per cent tariff on all imports from Brazil \u2014 a nation that is currently its number one supplier of beef.\n\nIn a letter to Brazil's president, Mr Trump said the tariffs were \"due in part to Brazil's insidious attacks on free elections\" and claimed the treatment of former president Jair Bolsonaro was a \"witch-hunt\" and \"international disgrace\".\n\n\"[However], there will be no tariff if Brazil, or companies within your Country, decide to build or manufacture product within the United States,\" Mr Trump wrote.\n\nThe tariffs are due to take effect on August 1.\n\nBrazil, led by Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is a significant trading partner of the US. (Reuters: Adriano Machado)\n\nUS-based Global AgriTrends meat analyst Brett Stuart said for Brazil's beef industry, the proposed 50 per cent tariff would become an import tax of 76.4 per cent, as it already incurs a 26.4 per cent duty once it exports more than 65,000 tonnes \u2014 a quota that was triggered in late January.\n\n\"In May this year, Brazil exported a record amount of beef into the US despite the 26.4 per cent tariff, plus Trump's 10 per cent [Liberation day tariff],\" he said.\n\n\"But at 76 per cent that is just untenable, that's unworkable.\n\n\"If Brazil doesn't find a way out of this by August 1, Brazilian beef exports to the US will halt.\"\n\nMr Stuart said Australia would be an obvious winner if Brazil bowed out of the US market.\n\n\"I think overnight, Australian and New Zealand beef prices will see sharp demand \u2026 the phones are going to be ringing if this happens,\" he said.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe US cattle herd is at its lowest level since the 1950s because of drought and US beef prices are at record highs, which has seen its reliance on imports climb.\n\n\"Right now, if you look at the price of lean beef in America versus the imported product from Australia, there's a discount,\" Mr Stuart said.\n\n\"But if Brazilian beef is no longer flowing into the US that discount would vanish quickly because American importers would be turning aggressively to Australia and others.\n\n\"I don't think we'll see a big shift in bids for Australian beef next week, but if that August 1 deadline passes and Trump says it's on, that could change quickly.\"\n\nLean beef prices are at record highs in the US. (ABC Landline)\n\nRecord Australian beef exports\n\nAustralia is already processing a record amount of cattle and producing a record amount of beef this year.\n\nAccording to Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), a record 134,593 tonnes of beef was exported last month and year-to-date Australia has exported 702,218 tonnes, which is up 17 per cent on this time last year.\n\nThe biggest customers this year have been the US (203,072 tonnes up 31 per cent), followed by China (147,391 tonnes up 39 per cent).\n\nChina has still not renewed export licences to about 300 abattoirs in the US and has been buying plenty of Australian beef instead.\n\nAnd it might soon find itself ramping up orders of Brazilian beef.\n\n\"If Brazil loses the US market, Chinese importers are going to be getting a deal on Brazilian beef,\" Mr Stuart said.\n\nChina has ramped up its imports of Australian grain-fed beef. (ABC Landline)\n\nUS consumers paying more\n\nThe US imported $US42.3 billion ($A64.2 billion) worth of Brazilian goods in 2024.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the tariffs on Brazil could have a significant impact on US food prices \u2014 and coffee.\n\n\"Around a third of the coffee consumed in the US, the world's largest drinker of the beverage, comes from Brazil\" it said.\n\n\"A tariff of that size would all but shut down that flow. Brazil will sell its coffee elsewhere.\"\n\nMore than half of the orange juice sold in the US also comes from Brazil.\n\nUS beef prices are already at record highs and Mr Stuart said a tax on imported Brazilian beef would not help.\n\n\"The irony here is that one of the major meat packers in America is Brazilian-owned (JBS) and it could make the argument [to Trump] that it's already invested heavily in America,\" he said.\n\n\"So let's see \u2014 Brazil has three weeks to cut a deal.\"\n\nWatch ABC TV's Landline at 12:30pm on Sunday or on ABC iview.",

        "text": "Investors in the collapsed First Guardian fund may struggle to recover their superannuation savings.\n\nIn the wake of this, many Australians may be concerned about their own retirement savings and whether they could be at risk.\n\nHere's what happened at First Guardian and how super savings are generally protected in Australia.\n\nWhat happened at First Guardian?\n\nUp to $446 million of people's superannuation may have been lost by a managed investment scheme, First Guardian Master Trust.\n\nAccording to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), investments were made into First Guardian by about 6,000 investors through superannuation platforms:\n\nDiversa\n\nNetwealth\n\nEquity Trustees\n\nASIC understands that many of those investors were called by lead generators who used high-pressure sales tactics to allegedly lure them to transfer their super into a choice fund, and then invest in First Guardian.\n\nFirst Guardian investors to lose super Photo shows A Lamborghini the company purchased in January 2023 for $548,000. Six thousand First Guardian investors have been told by the fund's liquidator there may be insufficient funds to pay back the superannuation funds they invested.\n\nFalcon Capital is the responsible entity for First Guardian and is now in liquidation.\n\nLiquidators from FTI Consulting say the case will take at least a year to resolve and that they may never recover a dollar of their superannuation savings.\n\nHowever, the liquidator has flagged that they would give people who invested \"priority\" treatment in trying to recover their funds if they paid them a fee.\n\nFTI Consulting suggested that Falcon funnelled investors' money into \"property developments and equity positions in related companies that may have shared a common director with the company\".\n\nSuper Consumers CEO Xavier O'Halloran says it is important for Australians to understand that what has collapsed is not a super fund but rather a managed investment scheme.\n\nThis means it's not regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), which oversees the stability and transparency of super funds.\n\n\"These are investment options that have failed, rather than the super funds that put these investment options on their shelves,\" Mr O'Halloran said.\n\n\"Think of an investment option like a brand of cereal in a supermarket or in this case the super fund's shelf.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nIs any compensation available?\n\nThere is a compensation scheme that provides a small amount of protection when people suffer financial loss, like those from First Guardian.\n\nHowever, it's capped at $150,000 to consumers who have an unpaid determination from AFCA.\n\n\"Typically a retiree can expect to retire with closer to $250,000, so that could create a massive hole in people's retirement plans,\" Mr O'Halloran said.\n\nThe Compensation Scheme of Last Resort (CSLR) is an independent body, established under legislation by the government to support the victims of financial misconduct.\n\nHow to assess investment options and super performance\n\nWhen investing your super, Mr O'Halloran said there were far more protections on investments labelled as \"MySuper\".\n\n\"These investments have to be designed to meet the needs of most members of a super fund and are performance tested annually by the regulator.\n\n\"If they fail the performance test once, they have to let you know, which is a big red flag and you should consider whether to stay.\n\n\"If they fail a second time they aren't allowed to take on new members until they can solve the problem, usually by merging with a better fund.\"\n\nIf you have a MySuper account, you'll likely either have a:\n\nSingle diversified investment option: Fund puts your money in a standard mix of investments, and this approach stays the same for your whole life\n\nFund puts your money in a standard mix of investments, and this approach stays the same for your whole life Lifecycle investment strategy: Fund typically moves your money from growth investments when you're young to more conservative when you're older\n\nThe YourSuper comparison tool helps you compare super funds based on their performance.\n\nHow much super should I have? Photo shows A pink piggy bank sits on a pile of Australian money Having an idea about the average super balance in Australia for your age can help you take the necessary steps to boost any shortfall.\n\nBut the First Guardian case highlights there are also big gaps in protection, Mr O'Halloran said.\n\n\"Some other investment options are independently tested by the regulator, but First Guardian and any other products not designed by the super fund offering them typically aren't tested,\" Mr O'Halloran said.\n\n\"Investment options designed for retirees are also not tested.\n\n\"This is a massive gap the federal government needs to plug if they are serious about protecting the retirement savings of Australians.\"\n\nThe warning signs\n\nASIC deputy chair Sarah Court says there are a number of red flags to look out for when it comes to sales calls about switching super.\n\n\"The initial salespeople can be very persuasive. Often the underlying schemes are complex or not made clear to the consumer, and it may be very difficult for even experienced investors to spot problems,\" Ms Court said.\n\n\"The caller will seemingly have your best interests at heart and may also involve referrals to financial advisers during the call to create a sense of comfort and legitimacy.\n\n\"Consumers should always ask questions about salespeople's connections to funds, particularly in circumstances where a particular fund appears in the pitch, as there may be a commission arrangement.\"\n\nHere are the common warning signs:\n\nHigh-pressure sales tactics\n\nCold calls\n\nThe touting of free superannuation \"health checks\" and prizes (often via social media advertisements or websites)\n\nOffers to find and consolidate \"lost super\" for free\n\nThe involvement of unlicensed people in the advice process\n\nPredominant engagement over the phone with limited client contact with a financial adviser\n\nPoor or no product disclosure\n\nPromises of high or unrealistic returns\n\nASIC alleges First Guardian used high pressure sales tactics to convince investors to transfer their super. (Supplied)\n\nSpeaking with ABC Radio Melbourne, stock market specialist Remo Greco from Sanlam Private Wealth says if you're being hassled to invest, \"get good at saying no\".\n\n\"If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.\"\n\nAre collapses like this common?\n\nOver the last year or so, there have been two other big collapses of these investment options.\n\nThey are:\n\nShield Master Fund: $480 million in assets and 5,800 investors\n\n$480 million in assets and 5,800 investors Australian Fiduciaries: $160 million in assets and 600 investors\n\nThe combined total losses, including First Guardian, could total $1.2 billion from over 12,000 Australians.\n\nWhere can I check my superannuation balance?\n\nYou can check your super balance, combine accounts, and search for lost super by logging into your myGov account and then clicking on Australian Taxation Office (ATO) under linked services.\n\nHow your super is invested Photo shows Two hands hold a light-pink ceramic piggy bank full of coins.

We all know we can score hundreds off 120 balls, but we need to dig in off this sort of surface.\"\n\nEarlier, Stokes won the toss under clear skies and would have expected his top order to take full advantage.\n\nIndia won the second Test by 336 runs to level the series without pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah.\n\nBumrah bowled a probing opening spell at Lord's as the touring side rode the momentum of their excellent performance at Edgbaston.\n\nCrawley drove Akash Deep sweetly to the cover boundary before greeting Mohammed Siraj to the attack with another crisp hit through the off side.\n\nBut neither Crawley nor Duckett looked comfortable on a slow pitch.\n\nImmediately after the drinks interval, Nitish Kumar Reddy struck in his first over when Duckett was dismissed, playing a loose stroke to a ball down the leg side and feathering a catch to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant.\n\nPope was dropped off his first ball, a very hard chance to Shubman Gill at gully, before Reddy squared up Crawley with a fine delivery and he edged it to Pant.\n\nA packed Lord's crowd was stunned into near silence as India celebrated wildly and Reddy continued to extract movement off the pitch as England laboured to 2-83 at lunch.\n\nRoot reached his 67th Test half-century to go with 36 hundreds for England's leading all-time run scorer, the milestone coming off 102 balls and including seven fours.\n\nIndia was dealt a blow when the free-scoring Pant was forced off the field with a finger injury but Pope was out to the first ball after tea, driving loosely at spinner Ravindra Jadeja and nicking the ball to stand-in keeper Dhruv Jurel.\n\nWhen Bumrah speared in a rapid ball that clipped the top of Harry Brook's off stump to send the in-form batter back to the pavilion for 11 with England on 4-172, India sensed it was back in the ascendancy.\n\nBut Root continued to bat smoothly and found a reliable partner in Stokes, the experienced pair defying the tiring Indian bowlers and keeping the scoreboard ticking over in the evening sunshine.\n\nRoot tried to complete his 37th Test century before the close but was unable to do so.\n\nHe will return on Friday when England will aim to put pressure on India by posting a commanding first-innings total.\n\nReuters",

These concerns relate to the potential use of artificial intelligence in the generation of your work, plagiarism, and/or collusion.\"\n\nA few days later, he was told an analysis of his work showed low editing time, evidence of chunks of text being cut and pasted into the document, and unusual formatting.\n\nMr McLauchlin insists he has not cheated and the reason his assignment metadata shows evidence of \"chunks of text being cut and paste\" is because he used a grammar checking software, Grammarly, approved by the university.\n\n\"I've been open and honest, right from the very first accusation, however the AI component of Grammarly was turned off,\" he said.\n\n\"The tool is widely advertised and encouraged by the university for students to use to help them with their studies.\"\n\nPassing despite marks cut\n\nThe university conducted its own investigation and concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, Mr McLauchlin had used AI for part of his assignment.\n\nIt also noted he had successfully completed nine units of his course and had no record of previous misconduct.\n\nIt decided Mr McLauchlin would receive only 70 per cent of the marks allocated to his workbook.\n\nMurdoch University says it does not comment on individual cases for privacy reasons. (Supplied: Murdoch University)\n\nHe said while he had enough marks from other assignments to pass the unit \u2014 even with the reduced mark from the workbook \u2014 and was on track to complete the degree this year, he was not willing to let the matter go.\n\n\"I guess my overall issue is that, still to date, Murdoch can't give me a word, sentence, paragraph, phrase or a pattern of AI [in my assignment],\" Mr McLauchlin said.\n\n\"I haven't used AI in the way that they believe that I've used AI.\n\n\" Being accused of being a cheat when you've put in so many years, hours, effort, money, time off work, time away from family to sit there and study \u2026 it's a big pill to swallow and it's quite hard. \"\n\nIn a written statement, Murdoch University said it could not comment on Mr McLauchlin's case for privacy reasons, but all students were \"required to complete an academic integrity module that includes instruction on the appropriate and inappropriate use of AI\".\n\nMark McLauchlin says he used university-endorsed grammar checking software, which may explain the accusation. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\n\"Where the use of generative AI in assessments is indicated, the university takes a considered and educative approach under established academic integrity processes,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Our first priority is to support students in understanding appropriate academic practices.\n\n\"Where concerns arise, our processes are designed to be fair, transparent and proportionate, with education and engagement prioritised before any punitive measures are considered.\"\n\nDetection of AI a fraught issue\n\nThe issue of AI detection is playing out on campuses around Australia, as universities and students grapple with the widespread availability of generative AI programs like ChatGPT.\n\nStudents are also increasingly worried about accusations, with some students choosing to run their assignments through checkers before handing them in, to make sure programs that check for plagiarism, like Turnitin, do not falsely accuse them of not doing original work.\n\nOne student told ABC Radio Perth she and her peers were now taking pre-emptive action against accusations of cheating.\n\n\"Quite a lot of students have started doing their assignments on a Google document so that there are time stamps for whenever anything has been written, deleted or changed to have proof you've written everything yourself,\" she said.\n\nDale, a recently retired TAFE teacher, said the practice of using AI to complete assignments was widespread.\n\nInternational students say AI detectors inaccurate Photo shows Logo Open AI is in white on black phone screen in front of a white computer screen with words. International students voice concerns AI detectors are inaccurate, as US researchers suggest the tools unfairly flag essays by people writing in English as a second language.\n\n\"I found students used AI to write assignments, but actually had little knowledge of the subject,\" he said.\n\n\"The machine has done the work, [the] student has no inherent knowledge.\"\n\nMr McLauchlin said his latest appeal of the university's decision had failed, and he was now seeking legal advice on where he could go from here.\n\nHe said it was not just about clearing his name, but about making a point to the university about its processes, which he said were impersonal and had not allowed him to fully make his case.\n\n\"That's the other reason why I'm kind of really going for this \u2026 I really believe that they're not 100 per cent informed of the impact of what they do, and how that can have [an affect] on people,\" he said.\n\nMurdoch University said it welcomed \"appeals and constructive feedback on our administrative processes\" and was \"committed to continuous improvement\".",

        "text": "They've been staged in the shadow of a state election, but the Tasmanian Planning Commission hearings into the Macquarie Point stadium have provided perhaps the sharpest level of detail about the proposed project.\n\nHeld over the past two weeks, the hearings have formed part of the Project of State Significance process and provided almost 30 stakeholders with the opportunity to present evidence to the planning commission panel assessing the stadium.\n\nTasmanian Planning Commission's panel has been conducting hearings over the past fortnight as part of the Project of State Significance process. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nThe project proponent, the Macquarie Point Development Corporation (MPDC), has also had the opportunity to respond to the panel's draft integrated assessment report released earlier this year.\n\nStakeholders were grilled by the panel and lawyers representing both the proponent, and a group opposing the stadium.\n\nSo, what went on inside the hearings?\n\nClick on the bullet points to jump to each section.\n\nLand use and development\n\nLawyers representing the state, Chris Townshend KC and Anthony Spence, based most of their arguments on what constituted an appropriate use of the Macquarie Point site, and the legislation under which the MPDC was operating under.\n\nWhy not York Park for AFL in Tasmania? Photo shows Carlton and Hawthorn players contest the ball The existing York Park stadium in Tasmania's north is often pointed to as a better, cheaper option for the state's AFL future than building a new arena in Hobart. Here is why that is considered a mistake.\n\nThe state posited the planning commission had over relied on a 1991 planning review of the Sullivans Cove area in its draft report, and not enough weight had been given to more current and relevant legislation such as the Macquarie Point Development Corporation Act.\n\nThe basis for large parts of its argument was that Macquarie Point had been earmarked for development under specific legislation, and that the Project of State Significance process effectively \"turned off\" other planning schemes.\n\nIn its opening submission, it told the panel that it would refer to a number of expert witnesses over the course of the hearings.\n\nLoading...\n\nUrban design and planning\n\nThe panel heard from local architects Leigh Woolley and Jerry De Gryse, who shared concerns about the stadium's size, scale and bulk.\n\nHealth issues top the list for these Tasmanian voters Photo shows Table scattered with medical items including a stethoscope. Two people's arms with one taking the other's blood pressure While a proposed AFL stadium has been a hot topic for discussion this election, many Tasmanians say their health needs are the main issue when considering how they'll vote on July 19.\n\nMr De Gryse questioned whether the stadium precinct would be adequately publicly accessible, while Mr Woolley argued that the Domain headland would be \"diminished and overwhelmed\" by the stadium.\n\nArchitect and heritage expert Jim Gard'ner presented revised impact assessments of the stadium on various locations around Hobart, based on fresh photo montages submitted by the proponent.\n\nHe rated the stadium as having a \"major\" impact on the Hobart Cenotaph, but downgraded its indirect impact on four other sites.\n\nA graphic of the \"key design features\" of the proposed Macquarie Point stadium, as shown in the Enabling Legislation Report Consultation Draft. (Tasmanian government)\n\nFor example, Mr Gard'ner had previously rated the stadium's indirect impact on the UTAS Arts building on Hunter Street as 'very high' but downgraded that to 'medium' based on the new images.\n\nHe recommended several conditions be applied to a planning permit, mostly relating to design tweaks which he believed would lessen the stadium's impact on the surrounding heritage area.\n\nStadium designers, Cox Architecture, presented a new \"fly through\" of the stadium, as well as an explanation of the stadium design to date.\n\nCox principal director Alastair Richardson was questioned on a wide range of elements, including stadium materials, roof beams, vehicle access, the proposed use of the Goods Shed and the stadium roof.\n\nBack to top\n\nThe roof\n\nThe roof, and its potential impacts, were widely discussed.\n\nPlanning expert Neil Shepherd, presenting on behalf of the MPDC, said, \"the roof represents the element that will provide the greatest visual impact, in my opinion\".\n\nBut he argued \"perceptions about the visual prominence of the building must be balanced against the desired role and functionality of the proposal in the chosen location\".\n\nYour Say: Tell us what matters to you this Tasmanian election Photo shows Have your say for the Tasmanian election. We want to know what issues matter most to you and what you want us to find out as Tasmania goes to another election.\n\nRespected town planner and urban designer Tim Biles, on behalf of the opponents group Our Place, launched a passionate critique of the stadium roof, decrying its potential impacts on the Hobart Cenotaph\n\nMr Shepherd, in response to questions from planning commission panellist Shelley Penn, said he took the view \"the significance of the cenotaph would remain, and that the roof would be another element in the view field\".\n\nThe level of roof transparency, and its potential reflectivity was also raised.\n\nRoland Browne, on behalf of Our Place, contended the Mount Nelson vista may not be able to be seen from the Cenotaph through the roof, due to the thickness of the ETFE (ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) material.\n\nMore information was submitted relating to Cricket Australia and Cricket Tasmania's concern with the roof, and the effect of shadowing it may cause on the cricket pitch.\n\nBack to top\n\nVisual impact\n\nA render of the new stadium as presented to the Tasmanian Planning Commission by architect Chris Goss of Melbourne based firm Orbit Solutions. (Supplied)\n\nA major theme of the hearings was the stadium's visual impact, and how its physical presence may affect the city of Hobart.\n\nMPDC presented \"visual amenity evidence\", including new photo montages of the stadium from various viewpoints around the city, produced by architect Chris Goss of Melbourne-based firm Orbit Solutions.\n\nIn response, anti-stadium group Our Place submitted an analysis of Mr Goss's images, compiled by landscape architect Barry Murphy.\n\nOur Place contested that the Orbit images presented the stadium with a \"transparent\" roof rather than a \"translucent\" roof, and questioned why Mr Goss's photo montages were compiled from viewpoints that were obscured by, in one example, a street sign, and, in a shot from the cenotaph, by a visiting cruise ship.\n\nA diorama model of Hobart's proposed Macquarie Point stadium. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\nOur Place had previously submitted its own photo montages, compiled by local architect Hamish Saul.\n\nIn a separate submission though, Mr Murphy, Mr Saul and Mr Goss co-signed a \"statement of agreed facts\" that concluded that Orbit's 3D model of the stadium building was more accurate in relation to the stadium's materiality, its form and mass, and its geometry, compared with Mr Saul's.\n\nHowever, the statement acknowledged a difference in opinion about the roof rendition and focal length used to take the photos, which Mr Murphy argued in his submission should have been 50mm instead of 20mm.\n\nBack to top\n\nEconomic, social and cultural impact\n\nThe panel heard from KPMG economists who prepared economic, financial impact and social benefits reports for the proponent last year.\n\nMichael Malakellis and David Harradine argued while their economic analysis found the benefit-cost ratio for the stadium would be less than one, they stressed the project should not be assessed in strict economic terms, given its unquantifiable social and brand value benefits.\n\nThe stadium has been a source of debate within the Tasmanian community.

The definition of a \"red cent\" and a qualification of the $375 million in taxpayer money for the planned Hobart stadium matter when determining if Jeremy Rockliff has broken his word.\n\nStadiums Tasmania chief executive James Avery also made a lengthy presentation to the panel, in which he revealed an updated operating model for the stadium had been developed.\n\nHe said it estimated the stadium would make $2.2 million per year before taxes, depreciation and amortisation \u2014 a way of managing the cost of intangible assets or loans \u2014 as opposed to a loss of more than $3 million per year under a previous model.\n\nIt was based on the new capital cost of the stadium, which was $945 million, but, unlike before, it now includes state ownership of food and beverage facilities, advertising boards, and premium hospitality.\n\nThe stadium is now forecast to host 37 major events, 40 2-day conferences and 260 \"minor events\" such as business functions and corporate dinners per year, accounting for 334 events across 377 days.\n\nRepresentatives from Tourism Industry Council Tasmania and Business Events Tasmania also fronted the hearings highlighting the significance of the proposed 1,500-person conference centre, as did independent local economist Graeme Wells, who disputed some of KPMG's findings.\n\nThe panel also heard from the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra, which had expressed concern about noise and vibration from the stadium during both the construction and operational phases.\n\nIn its submission, it proposed a number of conditions that should be applied, should planning approval for the stadium be granted.\n\nBack to top\n\nTransport, movement and access\n\nThe panel heard a planned underground car park has been reduced from three levels to two, and from 532 spaces to 374, reduced to keep the car park above the groundwater table.\n\nThe car park is expected to service the entire Macquarie Point precinct and is estimated to cost $97 million.\n\nHowever, according to the MPDC, that cost will not be worn by the state, as the car park \"is intended to be delivered as a commercial development opportunity and run by a private operator\".\n\nWhy not Bellerive Oval? The answer is more complicated than you think Photo shows A sports stadium as seen from the sky. Bellerive Oval has hosted AFL games for years, so why does Hobart need a multi-million-dollar stadium for its newly minted footy team?\n\nThe MPDC also states the car park is not required for the stadium's operations.\n\nGraeme Steverson of consultants WSP presented to the panel on transport matters, on behalf of the MPDC. He modelled a range of traffic and transport scenarios for large-scale sporting and concert events.\n\nCox Architecture submitted diagrams that showed egress from the stadium in the event of an emergency, and fielded questions about the safety of the venue.\n\nBack to top\n\nConsultation\n\nSeveral stakeholders raised what they said was a lack of consultation by the MPDC and the state Government to the panel as a major concern.\n\nStadium issue a vote changer Photo shows Man looking away from camera wears green beanie with 'Devils' written on it Whether or not to spend many millions of dollars on a stadium in Hobart is a question being weighed by voters, with some saying they'll change who they usually vote for.\n\nDaniel Hanna, representing Federal Group, which owns several properties on the Hobart waterfront, said the stadium would be detrimental to his company's business and that Federal had not been adequately consulted.\n\nLawyers representing the MPDC referenced seven meetings between 2023 and 2024 between the proponent and Federal regarding the stadium, but Mr Hanna did not consider those meetings as adequate consultation.\n\nHistorian and Aboriginal heritage experts Greg Lehman and Daphne Habibis echoed those sentiments, as did Nala Mansell from the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre.\n\nMs Mansell said Aboriginal land at Macquarie Point should be transferred to the Tasmanian Aboriginal people.\n\nBack to top\n\nRemediation and environment\n\nThe panel heard from the Environment Protection Authority (EPA), which had previously expressed concern about groundwater and contaminated fill at Macquarie Point.\n\nThe MPDC submitted that only about 10 per cent of fill material earmarked to be excavated will be \"level three\" material \u2014 material that requires an additional level of disposal and storage management.\n\nThe EPA submission outlined conditions it believed should be imposed, should the stadium development proceed, including that the director of the EPA be able to approve a stadium Construction Environmental Management Plan, and have a role in approving stadium design plans.\n\nIt also wants to be the body responsible for enforcing those, and other conditions.\n\nBack to top\n\nTasmania Football Club\n\nThe AFL has said a 23,000-seat, roofed stadium at Macquarie Point is a contractual requirement for a team to be granted access to the national competition. (Supplied: Tasmania Football Club/Solstice Digital)\n\nThe Tasmania Football Club, the Devils, was represented by chief executive officer Brendon Gale, who told the panel via a presentation that the stadium was crucial to the club's business case and viability.\n\nHe said that \"net stadium revenues\" accounted for 47 per cent of a typical AFL club's revenue and called them \"the most significant driver of financial competitive and financial strength\" of a club.\n\nHe added that stadium revenues accounted for just 43 per cent of club revenue 10 years ago.\n\nMr Gale said there existed a strong correlation between a club's off-field financial strength and their on-field success.\n\nBack to top\n\nTo read more submissions about the proposed Macquarie Point stadium, go to the Planning Commission website.",

        "text": "As residents across Western Australia grapple with their annual council rates, the Supreme Court has opened the door for local governments to tap mining companies for more revenue.\n\nThe Shire of Mount Magnet, about 570 kilometres north-east of Perth, this week won a Supreme Court appeal, allowing it to levy rates on land covered by vanadium miner Atlantic's \"miscellaneous licences\".\n\nLicences are generally held over land with infrastructure associated with mines, including pipelines, access roads, and staff accommodation.\n\nWith the WA government recently warning struggling councils not to use the mining industry and other ratepayers as \"cash cows\", the decision is expected to be closely examined by local governments across the state.\n\nMount Magnet has a small population, but has significant pressure on its infrastructure. (ABC Mid West Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nWith a population of just 583, Mount Magnet council collects about $2 million in rates each year.\n\nBut the shire's chief executive, Tralee Cable, said the additional revenue stream would allow the council to improve under-pressure local infrastructure.\n\n\"It will enable the shire to put in place some of the infrastructure that we're so desperately in need of that we haven't been able to do without grant or federal government funding,\" she said.\n\n\"For a lot of local governments in the centre of WA, this will be lifesaving.\n\n\"It does go a long way to balancing the scales of equitable funding for local government.\"\n\nTralee Cable says the additional rates will fund vital infrastructure. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Piper Duffy)\n\nMs Cable said the status and rateability of the land had been \"misread and misunderstood\" for years, with 13 other regional councils helping fund the legal challenge.\n\nShe said the shire issued rates notices to Atlantic in 2023 after examining the act more closely.\n\n\"It's not consistent to think that you can build infrastructure on land for mining purposes and be exempt from paying rates,\" Ms Cable said.\n\n\"This infrastructure is essential and critical to the generation of profit for the mining company. It's a business expense for the mining company.\"\n\nIndustry slams 'legal loophole'\n\nMining industry representatives slammed the decision, urging the government to take legislative action to prevent companies from being targeted.\n\nAssociation of Mining and Exploration Companies (AMEC) chief executive Warren Pearce said miscellaneous licences had always been considered exempt from rates under the Local Government Act.\n\nBut he said the wording of the exemption was changed slightly in the 1995 amendments to the act.\n\nWarren Pearce is urging the state government to change the legislation. (ABC News)\n\n\"We now have a situation where some clever lawyering, on behalf of the local government sector, has been able to exploit a loophole created by some poor drafting,\" Mr Pearce said.\n\n\"The judge has read the letter of the law and essentially ignored the intentions of the parliament in making those laws.\n\n\"There was clearly no desire to change the intent of that legislation. If there had been, it would have been discussed in the parliamentary debate.\"\n\nMr Pearce said the decision could cost the sector $55 million per year.\n\n\"The other reason this is particularly awful is that miscellaneous licences often sit on top of mining or exploration licences, which means local governments can rate the same land twice,\" Mr Pearce said.\n\n\"It's not reasonable to expect the mining industry to continue to be treated as a cash cow for unfinancial or unsustainable local governments.\"\n\nA state government spokesperson said in a statement it was aware of the Supreme Court ruling involving the shire's appeal.\n\n\"The Minister for Local Government has sought urgent advice from the Department of Local Government, Industry Regulation and Safety on this matter,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Once that advice has been received, the minister will review all options and take action to pursue any avenues available to the government.\"",

        "text": "\u201cWhat can you tell me about the centre bounce of the ball? It goes anywhere, so it\u2019s really, really hard for the players ... if the ball bounces sideways, they\u2019re going to move,\u201d Suns coach Damien Hardwick said. Geelong skipper Patrick Dangerfield described it as not a \u201cvaluable enough part of the game to protect\u201d, while Brisbane Lions coach Chris Fagan said, \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of the bounce ... it contributes to umpire contact. It bounces, goes all over the place.\u201d Removing the bounce is a decision the AFL Commission can make as it was not enshrined in the 2014 Laws of the Game Charter. Under the fundamental element category of the game, it says : \u201cAt the start of each quarter and after each goal, play is resumed by a ruck contest at a centre bounce or ball-up.\u201d Patrick Dangerfield doesn\u2019t think the bounce is a valuable enough part of the game to protect. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Removing the bounce to help reduce umpire-player contact (a counter-argument is that the certainty a ball-up provides crowds players around the umpire, making them more vulnerable) is not the only reason it has been in the gun.\n\nThose arguing for its elimination want to keep good decision makers in the game, even if they were ordinary bouncers. Let\u2019s face it, in what other sport \u2013 apart from perhaps skating in ice hockey \u2013 are umpires required to execute a physical skill? The ball is now thrown up at all centre bounces in the AFLW. In the AFL, it has been thrown up around the ground since 2013 and umpires can be exempted from bouncing the ball due to the risk of injury. The bounce must go up within a circle 10 metres in diameter and only the rucks can contest it. If the ball goes too far from the mark, it is called back, as the game attempts to balance unpredictability with fairness. It means umpires have to execute the skill even more perfectly than in the past when no recalls were required, ruckmen weren\u2019t nominated and any player could contest the ball where it landed.\n\nJust look below at some of the bounces from the past, from the 1975 and 1986 grand finals. Tradition? What tradition? Apart from all the rule changes, it\u2019s also worth noting that the tradition so fiercely protected to start a grand final has not occurred in two of the past 38 deciders.\n\nIn 1987, a free kick was paid to Carlton\u2019s Wayne Johnston before umpire Ian Robinson even had a chance to bounce the ball as five Hawthorn players stood in the square. It\u2019s not clear why Johnston, rather than the Carlton ruckman, was awarded the kick, but no one blinked an eye. In 2023, an errant bounce was recalled, taking two seconds off the clock in the Collingwood v Brisbane Lions decider before umpire Simon Meredith threw it up for Mason Cox and Oscar McInerney. When a bounce is recalled, the clock does not reset, losing the time taken.\n\nThat famous grand final that Collingwood won by four points was defined by a centre clearance goal in which Magpies star Jordan De Goey kicked to regain the lead with less than six minutes remaining. The ball was thrown up because of a 6-6-6 position warning. That moment of uncertainty was removed in a climactic end to a great grand final and could be again if a bounce was recalled. Yet, the sky didn\u2019t fall in.es remaining. The ball was thrown up because of a 6-6-6 position warning. Three of the final four centre bounce situations were ball-ups in the final six minutes, two due to 6-6-6 warnings and one due to a recall (which took two seconds off in the final five minutes). The AFL changed the rule at the start of this season so that umpires bounce the ball after issuing a 6-6-6 warning (as happened just before three-quarter-time time on Thursday night). It\u2019s time for a decision on the bounce\n\nThe rule changes around the centre bounces make you wonder what is being protected. In 2025, it has degenerated into a wrestling match between ruckmen, since the AFL last year enabled straight-arm blocks providing the ruck involved was contesting the ball. It is no longer exciting to watch. Lawmakers were trying to avoid such wrestling when they introduced the centre circle across the line in 1980, following the ugly rucking spectacle that marred the 1979 preliminary final when Collingwood\u2019s Peter Moore and North Melbourne\u2019s Gary Dempsey wrestled like two pythons throughout the match. For half a century the game achieved that objective until a 2024 rule change was introduced for reasons unknown. \u201cIt\u2019s gone back to Dempsey-Moore,\u201d Madden said, adding he would remove the line across the centre, and debate the size of the circle, to reconfigure the contest. \u201cEveryone would have to move to the ball.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think anyone would notice if the bounce was scrapped.\n\nAlthough the reason for the next major change was sound, the rot set in when the AFL limited the ruckman\u2019s run-up to 10m in 2005 to protect them against posterior cruciate ligament injuries which occurred when knee hit knee. Four years later, the chaotic element was minimised again when umpires were empowered to recall an errant bounce at a stoppage and replace it with a throw-up. It followed controversy when North Melbourne midfielder Adam Simpson was gifted a centre clearance in 2008 that led to a vital goal against Collingwood in round seven that season. That decision started the decline of the centre bounce into the relic it is now. A senior club official argued that the game should be wary of yielding to coaches\u2019 need for certainty in an era when fans crave the uncertainty sport provides. The bounce, he argued, should be retained on that basis.\n\nLoading But what we have is a facade of the centre bounce. Another real debate is needed. Scrap it forever in the interests of fairness, protecting umpires\u2019 backs and Hardwick and his ilk, or return it to the wonderful random tradition it once was by removing the recall. Incoming football operations boss Greg Swann needs to convince the AFL Commission to back the bounce or sack it. If they sacked what we have now, in less than a season, no one would miss it.",

        "text": "Critical to that balance is Canterbury\u2019s kicking game, where Toby Sexton has taken significantly more responsibility this season. His 11 forced drop-outs rank him equal-fourth in the NRL alongside Nathan Cleary.\n\nCanberra \u2018Faders\u2019? Not any more. They haven\u2019t been for a couple of seasons actually but, per Fox Sports, only the Dolphins (252) have scored more second-half points than the Raiders\u2019 224 this year. Ricky Stuart\u2019s men \u2013 once infamous for blowing match-winning leads \u2013 have secured four wins already in 2025 after trailing at half-time, along with another three victories when the scores were level at the break.\n\nCronulla\u2019s four losses from their past five starts have hit coach Craig Fitzgibbon where it hurts most \u2013 with the Sharks\u2019 defensive application falling off a cliff. For all the focus on Nicho Hynes and their playmaking spine, Cronulla have been easy pickings in the middle of late, dropping off tackles and conceding offloads \u2013 and then tries \u2013 at an alarming rate.\n\nThe Dolphins attack is flying despite a slew of sidelined forwards, but Isaiya Katoa is the story of their season. His 17 try-assists lead all comers and, across pretty much every playmaking statistic, his year-on-year improvements reflect a breakout campaign for the 21-year-old. Des Hasler was signed by the Titans with a remit of lifting the club out of its institutionalised mire, while defensive frailties were cited as a key factor in Justin Holbrook\u2019s surprise dismissal 18 months ago. Somehow the Gold Coast have become even worse without the ball under Hasler \u2013 whose defensive systems have held up across the rest of his career \u2013 and the drums are beating loudly that another coach will be in charge by summer.\n\nDaly Cherry-Evans\u2019 form has rightly been under the microscope throughout Manly\u2019s hit-and-miss campaign, but there\u2019s no doubting the Sea Eagles will miss his right-edge combination with Haumole Olakau\u2019atu once the skipper is gone. Manly\u2019s 35 tries down their right edge (where Tom Trbojevic has now slotted in at centre) are easily the most scored down that channel in the NRL \u2013 and they\u2019re twice as likely to strike than on the left, where Luke Brooks runs the show.\n\n\n\nThe Storm haven\u2019t been their uber-consistent selves this year \u2013 and no one knows this better than Craig Bellamy \u2013 but if they extend their opening quarters across a full game \u2026 good night. Melbourne rank first for points scored and conceded in the first 20 minutes and are also racking up tries for fun. Their 32.33 points a game is on track to join the best attacking sides in history \u2013 only the all-conquering Dave Brown-led Roosters of 1935 (35.2 points per game), and the 2021 Storm (33.1), have been more devastating with ball in hand. The Knights attack \u2013 averaging 14.81 points a game \u2013 is on par with some of the worst offensive seasons in the club\u2019s history. Aside from the 2016 wooden spoon (12.7 points a game), we\u2019re trawling back to their formative years for such trying times. Newcastle\u2019s defence (19 points conceded a game) is ranked third in the NRL and keeping them alive, but nine scoreless first halves says it all.\n\nRight next to Newcastle on the ladder, yet dealing with the exact opposite issue, North Queensland\u2019s best defensive effort of the season was the 16 points they kept Souths to in round six. Since the start of May, opposition sides have managed at least four tries a game against Todd Payten\u2019s team. Penrith\u2019s rise up the ladder with four straight wins has been built on the return of their prize-winning defence, with the 48 total points conceded against Parramatta, Wests Tigers, the Warriors and Canterbury in line with the efforts of their premiership-winning seasons.\n\nThe first three months of 2025, they were leaking more than double those figures. Jason Ryles\u2019 rebuild at the Eels is showing signs of life, just often not until after the half-time oranges. Parramatta\u2019s \u2013 144 first-half differential is the worst in the NRL. It\u2019s cold comfort, but between the 40 and 60-minute marks this season their record is promising: eight wins, five losses and two draws.\n\nShane Flanagan is still hunting quality middle forwards and with St George Illawarra\u2019s 1470 run metres a game ranking 15th in the NRL, it\u2019s no surprise. The Dragons have eight backs who have averaged more than 100 metres a game this season. But excluding Michael Molo\u2019s one game against Canberra for 115 metres, only back-rower Jaydn Su\u2019A is churning out triple figures each week among their forwards. For the second straight season, the Rabbitohs have been rocked by a horrific injury toll that has outstripped all 16 rivals.\n\nStatistics diligently tallied each week (until the start of round 18) by the NRL Physio and Rowan Waight calculate the combined absences of Souths stars \u2013 led by Cameron Murray, Cody Walker, Jack Wighton, Latrell Mitchell, Jye Gray, Campbell Graham and Jayden Sullivan \u2013 as all but tripling that of top-four contenders Brisbane, Canterbury, Canberra and the Warriors. Last year, Souths\u2019 173 weeks of combined weeks missed through injuries was again significantly higher than the Warriors (122 weeks out) as the next heaviest-hit club. Fox Sports has spelled out a bizarre phenomenon for the Tricolours this year, where they spend the least amount of time attacking the opposition\u2019s line from short-range, but are the best at doing it when they get their limited opportunities. With an average of just nine tackles inside the 20-metre zone each time they score a try, the Roosters convert that treasured field position better than anyone.\n\nTheir 75.7 per cent completion rate (16th in the NRL, but on par with Trent Robinson\u2019s 13 years in charge) goes a long way towards explaining why they get so few chances, yet also spend more time than any side in their own 20.\n\n\n\nThe freewheeling Warriors stereotype of years past is nowhere to be found in Andrew Webster\u2019s game plans \u2013 the Kiwi franchise is instead the NRL\u2019s most disciplined side with ball in hand. Conceding only 5.1 penalties a game (fourth in the competition) on top of the fewest errors has served the Warriors well after their 2024 fall from finals contention.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese is emphasising the importance of engaging with China.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe will embark on a six-day visit to the country, starting tomorrow [[Saturday]], and will meet with the country's leadership, including President Xi Jinping.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese says the face-to-face meetings are important on multiple fronts\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Engaging in our national interest is important for our security, to be able to raise issues one-on-one with the Chinese leadership. But of course it is important for our economic interests as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese will be accompanied by business leaders, as he tries to further enhance trade ties between Australia and China.\n\n\n\n\n\n25 per cent of Australian exports go to China, making it by far Australia's most significant trading partner.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerns are being raised that the new national plan to combat antisemitism in Australia could stifle free speech.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne recommendation made to the federal government by antisemitism envoy Jillian Segal is to strip funding from organisations that fail to address hatred against Jews.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome, including the National Union of Students and the Australian Jewish Council, are worried that hurt those making legitimate criticism of Israel, particularly admidst the current conflict in the Middle East.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking with SBS Arabic, a Board Director of Palestine Australia Relief and Action, Reem Borrows, is concerned advocacy for Palestinians will be deemed antisemitic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be very clear; we unequivocally condemn any form of racism. For context, antisemitism is not a Palestinian construct. The Palestinian struggle has always been about freedom, dignity, and equal rights, not just for ourselves but for all people. So it is deeply troubling to see legitimate criticism of the Israeli government, especially regarding Gaza, being conflated with antisemitism.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Segal says these concerns are misplaced, and only those calling for the elimination of the state of Israel will be deemed to be antisemitic.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister says he will not be providing the reasoning behind a 62 year-old Palestinian woman being detained as a national security risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nA document seen by SBS News revealed national security agency ASIO [[ay-zee-oh; Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] assessed Maha Almassri to be \"directly or indirectly a risk to security\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHer family has told SBS Arabic Ms Almassri lost family members, before fleeing Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer brother Solomon has condemned the government for detaining Ms Almassri, who he describes as a harmless old woman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They just came a bunch of police officers and some federal police and they just stormed the house and they had a search warrant. And they terrorised everyone inside the house.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was not present when she was arrested at another family member's home yesterday [[10 July]].\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's Migration Act grants the Home Affairs Minister \u2014 or a chosen delegate \u2014 the right to cancel a person's visa on character grounds if it is deemed to be \"in the national interest\".\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the Bosnian community in Australia have gathered to mark the Srebrenica [[shreb-ra-nitz-uh]] Massacre, on the anniversary of the tragedy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1995, more than 8000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys were killed near the town of Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe international court of justice has since recognised the event as an act of genocide - the worst since the second world war.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelma Music [[mew-sitch]] is a clinical psychologist who lost a parent in the Bosnian War.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Music has told SBS Bosnian coming together to remember the event helps survivors and loved ones of those who died cope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For various reasons, including that we share together the experiences of what has happened, but also that we alleviate a little bit of the pain and suffering that we carry with us every day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMany families still don't know what happened to their loved ones in Srebrenica, with around 1000 people missing since the atrocity.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice are treating a fire at a Sydney childcare centre in the early hours of this morning [[11 July]] as suspicious.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay to Learn in Turramurra on Sydney's upper-north shore was set alight, with the directors alerted around four thirty in the morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe centre's operations manager, Gemma Quinlan, has told Channel Nine she has no idea why the centre was targeted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're here to serve the community, we're here for our families and our children. We've been operating for 19 years on the Central Coast and have an amazing reputation up there. We have generations of families who have been through Play to Learn and this has never happened to Play to Learn before. We are absolutely dumbfounded and it just hurts.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nOn World Population Day, which is today [[jul 11]], experts are urging state and federal governments to use the challenge of an ageing population as an opportunity to develop transport infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sohani Liyanage is a Research Fellow in Sustainable Transport at Swinburne University of Technology who spoke with SBS Sinhala.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the nation needs to move beyond building more roads and concentrate on developing public transport networks, especially those living in less-connected areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many people in outer suburban areas face longer travel times, fewer options and higher transportation costs. So, the government needs to invest not just in services, but the things like lower fairs, paid passes and safe bike lanes. And more accessible stops and stations. \"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nU-S President Donald Trump says he'll impose a 35 per cent tariff on goods from neighbouring Canada- and is threatening to make the rate even higher if Canada retaliates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tariff will go into place on the 1st of August, much like Mr Trump's proposed tariffs against Brazil, and other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Brazilian President Lula da Silva has not been cowed by Mr Trump's threats against retaliation, saying he will impose reciprocal tariffs on U-S goods if a diplomatic solution cannot be found.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump has threatened 50 per cent tariffs on Brazilian goods, and has linked his decision on tariffs against the country to the treatment of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial on charges of plotting a coup against Mr da Silva in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nIrishman Ben Healy has won the sixth stage of the Tour de France, becoming the first Irishman in five years to win a stage at the world's most-famous cycling event.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealy says winning the 201.5 kilometre stage from Bayeux to Virie Mormandie is a dream come true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To grow up watching the Tour and one day wishing that I could maybe even be there so to even be here is an achievement, and now to win a stage, is just yeah, so, so, so amazing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Storer finished third- the best finish by an Aussie in the race so far this year.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Ireland's Ben Healy won stage six of the Tour de France in Normandy overnight with a long solo break, as Mathieu van der Poel reclaimed the overall leader's yellow jersey by one second.\n\n\n\n\n\nSixth at the start of the day, Van der Poel climbed above overnight leader Tadej Pogacar.\n\n\n\n\n\nVan der Poel was billed at the start of the tour as a potential winner of stage seven to Mur de Bretagne, where he first took the yellow in 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It would be a great finale to a great week,\" said an exhausted Van der Poel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I get the win or not, it'll be great anyway, just to wear the yellow jersey again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBelgium's Remco Evenepoel is third at 49 seconds with France's Kevin Vauquelin fourth at one minute. Jonas Vingegaard is fifth at one minute 14 seconds.\n\n\n\nHealy, 24, became the first Irish stage winner since sprinter Sam Bennett won on the Champs Elysees in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That was so enjoyable, and once we had all got away, I discussed it with the team car and we chose that unlikely place to attack,\" Healy said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm very proud to be presenting Ireland, I'm from an Irish family and though I wasn't born there it was an option I chose as a youngster.\"\n\n\n\nStage six was intense from the off over a series of hills between Bayeux and Vire as temperatures rose above 26.5C with the peloton putting the hammer down at 47km/h average over the first three hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealy and Van der Poel were part of a nine-person mid-race escape who set a relentless pace.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealy broke solo, knowing if he waited for the hilly finale, he had little chance of beating the proven experts in the breakaway.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe made his move suddenly on a flat section, 32km out. As he pulled to the left and accelerated, the eight others dithered as the distance widened.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Pogacar, allowing the Dutch powerhouse to sneak into the escape meant he lost the overall lead.\n\n\n\nOnce Healy had broken away, even Van der Poel sat up, saving energy, possibly for the run up the Mur de Bretagne \u2014 scene of his 2020 triumph to seize the tour lead he kept for eight days.\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind him, Pogacar and arch-rival Vingegaard battled up the final 10 per cent slope, but van der Poel regained the lead by the narrowest margin.\n\n\n\n'Vauquelin-mania'\n\nAfter an all-day effort, American champion Quinn Simmons came second, and Michael Storer put team Tudor on the tour podium for the first time in third.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day started in Bayeux, renowned for its tapestry of the 1066 Norman conquest of England, and also the birthplace of the burgeoning French star Kevin Vauquelin.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Arkea rider, 24, was the toast of the town as he left in third position on the tour, just 59 seconds adrift of Pogacar and ended in fourth overall at one minute.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Think you could race the Tour de France? Explore the 2025 map and key stats\n\nAhead of the stage, Vauquelin hailed \"the roads where I grew up and learned to love the hills\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the finish line, he spoke of \"goose bumps\" as the fans cheered him along, with local media speaking of \"Vauquelin-mania\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter six days of racing in northern France, the Tour heads west with a 197km run from Saint-Malo over rolling hills in Brittany, finishing atop the steep climb called the Mur-de-Bretagne.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "One script every five minutes on average \u2014 that's how fast a single doctor was prescribing medicinal cannabis, raising concerns from Australia\u2019s health regulator.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA), over a six-month period, some practitioners have written over 10,000 prescriptions for medicinal cannabis, with one issuing more than 17,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nAHPRA said that as of 31 December last year, 57 practitioners (medical practitioners, pharmacists and nurses) had action taken against them by a medical board over prescribing medicinal cannabis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Current prescribing data raises red flags that some practitioners are not meeting their professional obligations,\" AHPRA stated.\n\n\n\n\n\nAPHRA has issued new guidelines to help practitioners who prescribe medicinal cannabis, addressing concerns that \"poor practice\" may cause \"significant patient harm\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSome experts have welcomed these guidelines.\n\n\n\n\"I think it's timely for the regulator for medical practice to be putting out some clear statements on the inappropriateness of some of the prescribing,\" emeritus professor Wayne Hall, from the National Centre for Youth Substance Use Research at the University of Queensland, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, some advocates say that patients still face difficulties in obtaining them through their GPs, pointing out a \"lack of education\" among the doctors, which may account for high prescribing rates among some practitioners.\n\n\n\n\n\nAPHRA noted \"in relation to the vast majority of notifications received by APHRA in this area, practitioners often respond to our involvement by modifying their practices without the need for further regulatory action\".\n\n\n\nA 'stigma' amongst GPs\n\nIn Australia, medicinal cannabis was legalised in 2016 .\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, prescriptions increased from about 17,000 in 2020 to over 800,000 in 2024, according to the Department of Health. As patients may receive multiple prescriptions, this data doesn't show how many individuals access medicinal cannabis.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, APHRA warned: \"poor medicinal cannabis prescribing practices and surging patient demand are leading to significant patient harm\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also raised its concerns by \"patients presenting to emergency departments with medicinal cannabis induced psychosis\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHall said the \"major driver\" for the rise in prescriptions is \"profit\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these medical cannabis clinics that have been set up, they only prescribe cannabis, and they do it from their point of view, at a high volume of prescriptions is the way to generate a good profit margin,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's what they seem to be doing without a great deal of care taken in assessing the appropriateness of prescriptions for patients.\"\n\n\n\nBut some supporters of the Australian medicinal cannabis industry argue that those seeking a prescription mostly approach doctors remotely, as there is a \"stigma\" among doctors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The problem is that mainstream general practice practitioners are generally reluctant to prescribe medicinal cannabis,\" Teresa Nicolleti, chair of the Australian Medicinal Cannabis Association, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They don't know enough about medicinal cannabis. There's a historical concern around the prohibition before it was legalised, and whether they should be prescribing it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are now hundreds of thousands of scripts being issued, but they're being issued by telehealth clinics rather than GPs. There's only a very, very small proportion of GPS who will prescribe medicinal cannabis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtual care, or Telehealth clinics, are a type of service that provides healthcare services remotely, typically through video or phone consultations\n\n\n\nLack of 'education', or lack of 'evidence'?\n\nNicolleti said one of the reasons behind this stigma is that there is \"not enough education\" among doctors about the benefits of medicinal cannabis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The problem is if the colleges, the peak bodies, aren't supporting it, then it's very difficult for GPs to become comfortable with it. And so until that position changes, I don't think we're going to address this,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost medicinal cannabis products are considered unregistered medicines by Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), which means they haven't undergone the same rigorous assessment for safety and efficacy as registered medicines.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, practitioners need the TGA's approval to prescribe medicinal cannabis products.\n\n\n\n\n\nHall said: \"The problem is that we have these drugs being prescribed for unapproved purposes, that is to treat conditions for which these drugs are not approved by the regulatory body [TGA].\"\n\n\n\nDoctors need the medicines watchdog's approval to prescribe medicinal cannabis products. Source: Getty / FG Trade He said that, alongside education, \"lack of evidence\" about some medicinal use of cannabis is also one of the reasons GPs are reluctant to prescribe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The great majority of prescriptions under the medical cannabis program are for things like chronic pain, sleep disorders, anxiety, and distress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The problem is that when the use becomes regular and people are using regularly over long periods ... They put themselves at risk of developing dependence, and the evidence for long-term effectiveness and safety is, is really not there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In those cases, the evidence for efficacy and safety is, is much more marginal or very lacking in the case of [conditions like] anxiety and depression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think part of the reason for scepticism about medical use is that the evidence isn't there for a lot of the reasons, the medical conditions for which people seek prescriptions.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Thailand's pygmy hippo Moo Deng marked her first birthday on Thursday, drawing crowds of diehard fans even as she left behind the cute animal infancy that earned her worldwide internet fame.\n\n\n\n\n\nBig crowds are expected at a four-day festival at Khao Kheow Open Zoo where Moo Deng \u2014 which means \"Bouncy Pork\" in Thai \u2014 frolicked to stardom and amassed five million social media followers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first day of the extravaganza fell on a Thai public holiday with an agenda including a lecture on \"Moo Deng's cheekiness\", while a skincare beautician paid to sponsor her fruit-festooned birthday cake.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 100 fans gathered outside her enclosure on Thursday morning, fewer than the hordes she commanded at the height of her fame, but still animated with adoration.\n\n\n\n\n\nJennifer Tang took a week off from her work in Malaysia to make the pilgrimage, telling AFP she was \"a little bit obsessed\" with the calf she described as a \"chaos rage potato\".\n\n\n\n\"She's really special to me, she makes me happy,\" she said. Tang insisted Moo Deng is \"still really sassy and funny\" despite approaching maturity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Take a look at the crowd today \u2014 she's still a legend,\" she added.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoo Deng has swollen from 5kg at birth to 93kg today.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe spent her birthday plodding in her enclosure, munching fruit and vegetables, a stark contrast to the energetic yet clumsy antics that earned her fame as a pint-sized pachyderm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Moo Deng used to be very naughty and jumped around all the time,\" said Attaphol Nundee, one of her six handlers. \"Now she only eats and sleeps.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Her popularity has slowed,\" admitted the 32-year-old. \"But some old fans have returned, and there are new ones too.\" Despite her waning fame, \"her eyes light up when people take photos of her\", he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer handlers are set to auction her belongings later, but it is unclear what possessions she has accumulated in her short life at the Chonburi province zoo, a two-hour drive from Bangkok.\n\n\n\n'Cute doesn't last long'\n\nMoo Deng's blubbery rose-blushed face launched a thousand memes and a plethora of merchandise, including piggy banks, party shirts and popsicles, prompting her owners to trademark her likeness.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe once quadrupled ticket sales for the zoo where she resides in a sparse, stone, five square metre public enclosure, once livestreamed 24/7 to sate the internet's appetite for her.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Harris or Trump? Moo Deng the baby hippo has made her pick for US president\n\nThere were hopes her stardom would spotlight the plight of the endangered pygmy hippo, native to West Africa, with only around 2,500 left alive according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. But social media and search engine metrics suggest Moo Deng's popularity peaked around late September last year before dramatically declining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Moo Deng went viral very quickly when she was born,\" said Joshua Paul Dale, an academic who teaches courses on the phenomenon of \"cuteness\" at Japan's Chuo University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Maybe part of our appreciation of cuteness is knowing that it's something that doesn't last very long,\" he told AFP.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoo Deng is part of a pantheon of captive animals who have enjoyed flash-in-the-pan popularity for their cuteness online, including Australia's Pesto the penguin and China's Hua Hua the panda.\n\n\n\n\n\nPygmy hippos have a lifespan of between 30 and 50 years.\n\n\n\n",

Of these 2,300, 1,500 have only died because of climate change, they would not have died if not for our burning of oil, coal, and gas in the last century.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the first rapid attribution study to go beyond linking climate change to weather events, and instead ties it directly to human deaths.\n\n\n\n\n\nElderly populations were especially vulnerable, with more than 1,100 of the deceased aged over 75.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiostatistician at Imperial College London - Gary Konstantinoudis says it\u2019s not just the heat itself, but the body's ability, or inability, to cope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Older people are reported to have impaired thermoregulatory systems. That is when the temperatures are very high, the generic population have good mechanisms to regulate heat whereas older populations, these mechanisms do not work properly, putting strain on their cardiovascular systems and thus putting them at higher risk for hospitalisation or mortality.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study comes as southern Europe swelters through its second major heatwave of the season, with temperatures in Greece, Spain and southern France soaring above 42 degrees Celsius.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Athens, a pharmacy sign displayed 44 degrees on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nTourists at the Acropolis were turned away at the gates for the second afternoon in a row, as Greek authorities closed the historic site to prevent heatstroke and other medical emergencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nRed Cross volunteer Sophia Markelos explains what they are doing to help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are here today because of the heatwave that has struck Athens, to provide waters, cold waters, as the Hellenic Red Cross to all the visitors that come up to the Acropolis and papers (leaflets) that have instructions on how to deal with the heatwaves - about the (heat) stroke and also suntan (sunscreen).\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome tourists took the closure in their stride, but others were clearly disappointed.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrandon Smith is a tourist from Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not ideal because when you're travelling away, you're not able to see it, so it's not good. And we're leaving.\n\n\n\nAnd yes, we're leaving tonight, so we won't get to see it.\n\n\n\nJournalist: Are you disappointed?\n\n\n\nSmith: Very disappointed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther west, France\u2019s second-largest city Marseille has been left scorched after a wildfire tore through 750 hectares of land on the city\u2019s outskirts.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least ten homes were destroyed, dozens more damaged, and though no deaths were reported, the blaze forced residents into temporary lockdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials say the fire started when a car caught alight on a nearby highway.\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh winds and weeks of dry weather did the rest.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Strasbourg, E-U Commissioner for Preparedness and Crisis Management, Hadja Lahbib, tells the European Parliament the situation is already becoming unmanageable in parts of Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In just the past ten days, thousands of hectares have burned in France, in Greece, Germany, Spain, Albania, Serbia and Turkey. We are witnessing the destruction of ecosystems that will take years, even decades to recover. And our citizens are feeling the impact of this extreme weather ... These are not distant warnings, they are the direct consequence of climate change, and they are sending us a very clear message.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe E-U has pre-positioned 22 firefighting planes, four helicopters, and 650 firefighters across vulnerable countries like Greece, Portugal and Spain.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Lahbib says Europe must use every tool - technology, science, and political will - to respond before disaster strikes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our teams are on standby 24/7. While national authorities led on wildfire response, we are working side-by-side with them every step of the way. And the EU can step in even before wildfires start. We are using science and technology to monitor droughts and detect fires at a very early stage. This includes the use of drones and AI to detect and respond to fires.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the Vatican, Pope Leo celebrated a special Mass on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis homily focused on the moral imperative of climate action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On this beautiful day, first of all, I would like to invite everyone, starting with myself, to experience a bit of what we are celebrating, the beauty of the natural cathedral, you could say. ... At the beginning of the Mass, we prayed for conversion, our conversion, and I would like to add that we must pray for the conversion of many people inside and outside the Church who still do not see the urgency of caring for our common home.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "United States President Donald Trump has launched his global tariff blitz into overdrive, announcing a new 50 per cent tariff on US copper imports and a 50 per cent duty on goods from Brazil, both to take effect on 1 August.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am announcing a 50% tariff on Copper, effective August 1, 2025, after receiving a robust national security assessment,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social, an apparent reference to a national security trade investigation into the red metal that has been underway.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement came hours after he also informed Brazil that its \"reciprocal\" tariff would be raised from its previous level of 10 percent.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump first broached the copper tariff during a cabinet meeting early on Wednesday morning AEST , setting off a scramble by companies to import as much copper as soon as possible from Chile and other major suppliers.\n\n\n\nHe blamed the decline of the US copper industry on past administrations, saying copper was needed for semiconductors, aircraft, electric vehicle batteries, and military hardware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"America will, once again, build a dominant copper industry,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\n\nTrump's Brazil tariff order\n\nTrump's Brazil tariff order came in a letter to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva that vented anger over what he called the \"witch hunt\" trial of Lula's right-wing predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's comments add to an increasingly bitter public feud that has been ongoing between him and Lula.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump also criticised what he said were Brazil's attacks on free elections, Americans' free speech, and \"secret and unlawful censorship orders to US social media platforms\". He ordered the US Trade Representative's office to launch a new \"Section 301\" unfair trade practices investigation that could add even more tariffs, citing \"Brazil's continued attacks on the digital trade activities of American companies\".\n\n\n\nLula responded to Trump's letter by issuing a statement saying that any unilateral measure to increase tariffs would be met with a response under Brazilian law.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazil is the 15th largest US trading partner. Top US exports to Brazil are commercial aircraft, petroleum products, crude oil, coal, and semiconductors, while Brazil's top exports to the US are crude oil, coffee, semi-finished steel, and pig iron.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe South American country has held off on implementing a digital services tax but has sought to advance legislation with stronger competition regulations on digital platforms.\n\n\n\nTrump issues tariff notices to seven minor trading partners\n\nTrump earlier on Truth Social media issued 1 August tariff notices to seven minor trading partners that exported approximately US$15 billion ($23 billion) in goods to the US last year: a 20 per cent tariff on goods from the Philippines, 30 per cent on goods from Sri Lanka, Algeria, Iraq, and Libya, and 25 per cent on Brunei and Moldova.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest letters add to 14 others issued earlier in the week, including 25 per cent tariffs for big US suppliers South Korea and Japan , which are also to take effect on 1 August, barring any trade deals reached before then.\n\n\n\nThey were issued a day after Trump said he was broadening his trade war by imposing a 50 per cent tariff on imported copper and would soon introduce long-threatened levies on semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's rapid-fire tariff moves have cast a shadow over the global economic outlook, paralysing business decision-making.\n\n\n\nNegotiations with the European Union\n\nTrump said trade talks have been going well with China and the European Union, which is the US's biggest bilateral trading partner.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump said he would \"probably\" tell the EU within two days what rate it could expect for its exports to the US, adding that the 27-nation bloc had become much more cooperative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They treated us very badly until recently, and now they're treating us very nicely. It's like a different world, actually,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEU trade chief Maros Sefcovic said good progress had been made on a framework trade agreement, and a deal may even be possible within days.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Italian economy minister Giancarlo Giorgetti had earlier warned that talks between the two sides were \"very complicated\" and could continue right up to the deadline.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\u201cWhat can you tell me about the centre bounce of the ball? It goes anywhere, so it\u2019s really, really hard for the players ... if the ball bounces sideways, they\u2019re going to move,\u201d Suns coach Damien Hardwick said. Geelong skipper Patrick Dangerfield described it as not a \u201cvaluable enough part of the game to protect\u201d, while Brisbane Lions coach Chris Fagan said, \u201cI\u2019m not a fan of the bounce ... it contributes to umpire contact. It bounces, goes all over the place.\u201d Removing the bounce is a decision the AFL Commission can make as it was not enshrined in the 2014 Laws of the Game Charter. Under the fundamental element category of the game, it says : \u201cAt the start of each quarter and after each goal, play is resumed by a ruck contest at a centre bounce or ball-up.\u201d Patrick Dangerfield doesn\u2019t think the bounce is a valuable enough part of the game to protect. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Removing the bounce to help reduce umpire-player contact (a counter-argument is that the certainty a ball-up provides crowds players around the umpire, making them more vulnerable) is not the only reason it has been in the gun.\n\nThose arguing for its elimination want to keep good decision makers in the game, even if they were ordinary bouncers. Let\u2019s face it, in what other sport \u2013 apart from perhaps skating in ice hockey \u2013 are umpires required to execute a physical skill? The ball is now thrown up at all centre bounces in the AFLW. In the AFL, it has been thrown up around the ground since 2013 and umpires can be exempted from bouncing the ball due to the risk of injury. The bounce must go up within a circle 10 metres in diameter and only the rucks can contest it. If the ball goes too far from the mark, it is called back, as the game attempts to balance unpredictability with fairness. It means umpires have to execute the skill even more perfectly than in the past when no recalls were required, ruckmen weren\u2019t nominated and any player could contest the ball where it landed.\n\nJust look below at some of the bounces from the past, from the 1975 and 1986 grand finals. Tradition? What tradition? Apart from all the rule changes, it\u2019s also worth noting that the tradition so fiercely protected to start a grand final has not occurred in two of the past 38 deciders.\n\nIn 1987, a free kick was paid to Carlton\u2019s Wayne Johnston before umpire Ian Robinson even had a chance to bounce the ball as five Hawthorn players stood in the square. It\u2019s not clear why Johnston, rather than the Carlton ruckman, was awarded the kick, but no one blinked an eye. In 2023, an errant bounce was recalled, taking two seconds off the clock in the Collingwood v Brisbane Lions decider before umpire Simon Meredith threw it up for Mason Cox and Oscar McInerney. When a bounce is recalled, the clock does not reset, losing the time taken.\n\nThat famous grand final that Collingwood won by four points was defined by a centre clearance goal in which Magpies star Jordan De Goey kicked to regain the lead with less than six minutes remaining. The ball was thrown up because of a 6-6-6 position warning. That moment of uncertainty was removed in a climactic end to a great grand final and could be again if a bounce was recalled. Yet, the sky didn\u2019t fall in.es remaining. The ball was thrown up because of a 6-6-6 position warning. Three of the final four centre bounce situations were ball-ups in the final six minutes, two due to 6-6-6 warnings and one due to a recall (which took two seconds off in the final five minutes). The AFL changed the rule at the start of this season so that umpires bounce the ball after issuing a 6-6-6 warning (as happened just before three-quarter-time time on Thursday night). It\u2019s time for a decision on the bounce\n\nThe rule changes around the centre bounces make you wonder what is being protected. In 2025, it has degenerated into a wrestling match between ruckmen, since the AFL last year enabled straight-arm blocks providing the ruck involved was contesting the ball. It is no longer exciting to watch. Lawmakers were trying to avoid such wrestling when they introduced the centre circle across the line in 1980, following the ugly rucking spectacle that marred the 1979 preliminary final when Collingwood\u2019s Peter Moore and North Melbourne\u2019s Gary Dempsey wrestled like two pythons throughout the match. For half a century the game achieved that objective until a 2024 rule change was introduced for reasons unknown. \u201cIt\u2019s gone back to Dempsey-Moore,\u201d Madden said, adding he would remove the line across the centre, and debate the size of the circle, to reconfigure the contest. \u201cEveryone would have to move to the ball.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think anyone would notice if the bounce was scrapped.\n\nAlthough the reason for the next major change was sound, the rot set in when the AFL limited the ruckman\u2019s run-up to 10m in 2005 to protect them against posterior cruciate ligament injuries which occurred when knee hit knee. Four years later, the chaotic element was minimised again when umpires were empowered to recall an errant bounce at a stoppage and replace it with a throw-up. It followed controversy when North Melbourne midfielder Adam Simpson was gifted a centre clearance in 2008 that led to a vital goal against Collingwood in round seven that season. That decision started the decline of the centre bounce into the relic it is now. A senior club official argued that the game should be wary of yielding to coaches\u2019 need for certainty in an era when fans crave the uncertainty sport provides. The bounce, he argued, should be retained on that basis.\n\nLoading But what we have is a facade of the centre bounce. Another real debate is needed. Scrap it forever in the interests of fairness, protecting umpires\u2019 backs and Hardwick and his ilk, or return it to the wonderful random tradition it once was by removing the recall. Incoming football operations boss Greg Swann needs to convince the AFL Commission to back the bounce or sack it. If they sacked what we have now, in less than a season, no one would miss it.",

Still not drinking.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the plan to put down my wine glass for good, but life had other ideas. My mother passed away, I hit a few health bumps, and somewhere in the quiet of it all I realised that booze was taking more than it was giving. So I stopped.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve written about life on the other side of the bottle, and if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learnt, it\u2019s that when you respond to a friendly \u201cwine?\u201d with a polite \u201cno thanks, I don\u2019t drink\u201d, people have questions. Lots of them. So here are the ones I get asked the most, and how I answer them.\n\nWhen you tell people that you don\u2019t drink, they have questions. Credit: Getty\n\nWhy?

        "text": "Critical to that balance is Canterbury\u2019s kicking game, where Toby Sexton has taken significantly more responsibility this season. His 11 forced drop-outs rank him equal-fourth in the NRL alongside Nathan Cleary.\n\nCanberra \u2018Faders\u2019? Not any more. They haven\u2019t been for a couple of seasons actually but, per Fox Sports, only the Dolphins (252) have scored more second-half points than the Raiders\u2019 224 this year. Ricky Stuart\u2019s men \u2013 once infamous for blowing match-winning leads \u2013 have secured four wins already in 2025 after trailing at half-time, along with another three victories when the scores were level at the break.\n\nCronulla\u2019s four losses from their past five starts have hit coach Craig Fitzgibbon where it hurts most \u2013 with the Sharks\u2019 defensive application falling off a cliff. For all the focus on Nicho Hynes and their playmaking spine, Cronulla have been easy pickings in the middle of late, dropping off tackles and conceding offloads \u2013 and then tries \u2013 at an alarming rate.\n\nThe Dolphins attack is flying despite a slew of sidelined forwards, but Isaiya Katoa is the story of their season. His 17 try-assists lead all comers and, across pretty much every playmaking statistic, his year-on-year improvements reflect a breakout campaign for the 21-year-old. Des Hasler was signed by the Titans with a remit of lifting the club out of its institutionalised mire, while defensive frailties were cited as a key factor in Justin Holbrook\u2019s surprise dismissal 18 months ago. Somehow the Gold Coast have become even worse without the ball under Hasler \u2013 whose defensive systems have held up across the rest of his career \u2013 and the drums are beating loudly that another coach will be in charge by summer.\n\nDaly Cherry-Evans\u2019 form has rightly been under the microscope throughout Manly\u2019s hit-and-miss campaign, but there\u2019s no doubting the Sea Eagles will miss his right-edge combination with Haumole Olakau\u2019atu once the skipper is gone. Manly\u2019s 35 tries down their right edge (where Tom Trbojevic has now slotted in at centre) are easily the most scored down that channel in the NRL \u2013 and they\u2019re twice as likely to strike than on the left, where Luke Brooks runs the show.\n\n\n\nThe Storm haven\u2019t been their uber-consistent selves this year \u2013 and no one knows this better than Craig Bellamy \u2013 but if they extend their opening quarters across a full game \u2026 good night. Melbourne rank first for points scored and conceded in the first 20 minutes and are also racking up tries for fun. Their 32.33 points a game is on track to join the best attacking sides in history \u2013 only the all-conquering Dave Brown-led Roosters of 1935 (35.2 points per game), and the 2021 Storm (33.1), have been more devastating with ball in hand. The Knights attack \u2013 averaging 14.81 points a game \u2013 is on par with some of the worst offensive seasons in the club\u2019s history. Aside from the 2016 wooden spoon (12.7 points a game), we\u2019re trawling back to their formative years for such trying times. Newcastle\u2019s defence (19 points conceded a game) is ranked third in the NRL and keeping them alive, but nine scoreless first halves says it all.\n\nRight next to Newcastle on the ladder, yet dealing with the exact opposite issue, North Queensland\u2019s best defensive effort of the season was the 16 points they kept Souths to in round six. Since the start of May, opposition sides have managed at least four tries a game against Todd Payten\u2019s team. Penrith\u2019s rise up the ladder with four straight wins has been built on the return of their prize-winning defence, with the 48 total points conceded against Parramatta, Wests Tigers, the Warriors and Canterbury in line with the efforts of their premiership-winning seasons.\n\nThe first three months of 2025, they were leaking more than double those figures. Jason Ryles\u2019 rebuild at the Eels is showing signs of life, just often not until after the half-time oranges. Parramatta\u2019s \u2013 144 first-half differential is the worst in the NRL. It\u2019s cold comfort, but between the 40 and 60-minute marks this season their record is promising: eight wins, five losses and two draws.\n\nShane Flanagan is still hunting quality middle forwards and with St George Illawarra\u2019s 1470 run metres a game ranking 15th in the NRL, it\u2019s no surprise. The Dragons have eight backs who have averaged more than 100 metres a game this season. But excluding Michael Molo\u2019s one game against Canberra for 115 metres, only back-rower Jaydn Su\u2019A is churning out triple figures each week among their forwards. For the second straight season, the Rabbitohs have been rocked by a horrific injury toll that has outstripped all 16 rivals.\n\nStatistics diligently tallied each week (until the start of round 18) by the NRL Physio and Rowan Waight calculate the combined absences of Souths stars \u2013 led by Cameron Murray, Cody Walker, Jack Wighton, Latrell Mitchell, Jye Gray, Campbell Graham and Jayden Sullivan \u2013 as all but tripling that of top-four contenders Brisbane, Canterbury, Canberra and the Warriors. Last year, Souths\u2019 173 weeks of combined weeks missed through injuries was again significantly higher than the Warriors (122 weeks out) as the next heaviest-hit club. Fox Sports has spelled out a bizarre phenomenon for the Tricolours this year, where they spend the least amount of time attacking the opposition\u2019s line from short-range, but are the best at doing it when they get their limited opportunities. With an average of just nine tackles inside the 20-metre zone each time they score a try, the Roosters convert that treasured field position better than anyone.\n\nTheir 75.7 per cent completion rate (16th in the NRL, but on par with Trent Robinson\u2019s 13 years in charge) goes a long way towards explaining why they get so few chances, yet also spend more time than any side in their own 20.\n\n\n\nThe freewheeling Warriors stereotype of years past is nowhere to be found in Andrew Webster\u2019s game plans \u2013 the Kiwi franchise is instead the NRL\u2019s most disciplined side with ball in hand. Conceding only 5.1 penalties a game (fourth in the competition) on top of the fewest errors has served the Warriors well after their 2024 fall from finals contention.",

There was the car thief who tried to steal a manual vehicle but couldn\u2019t get it into first gear. When I was at school, a guy got hot and sweaty while burgling a house and took his jumper off. He left it at the scene, not realising that his mum had sewn his name tag into the collar.\n\nThis week\u2019s addition to \u2018Wanted: Dumb or Alive\u2019 is the football supporter who apparently made a \u201cdeath threat\u201d against Carlton coach Michael Voss, but sent it to the Melbourne Cricket Ground\u2019s own anti-social hotline. The person was identified as quickly as the geniuses who post footage of themselves stealing cars on TikTok, and has been given a five-year ban from attending AFL games or any sport at the MCG.\n\nVoss, a much-admired man who has been under heavy criticism for Carlton\u2019s performance, said he was \u201cdismissive [of the message] at first\u201d, but felt he should draw attention to \u201cthe dark side of football, where we blame, we become victims and it\u2019s this environment where things are quite toxic. We think by showing passion is about anger \u2013 and it\u2019s not about that at all.\u201d As for the miscreant, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you don\u2019t belong here.\u201d\n\nThe AFL\u2019s head of security and integrity, Tony Keane, made a statement: \u201cWe understand there is passion in the game, however the text message in question sent to the MCG hotline on Friday crossed the line. Regardless of the intent, no coach, player, official, staff member or fan deserves to be threatened in such a way, and now that patron has lost the privilege of attending the footy.\u201d",
