        "text": "A quick dip to cool off on a scorching summer's day, or a casual wade through gentle waves with family and friends, is a pastime deeply rooted in the Australian experience.\n\nBut until this month, Carly Burns struggled to get past the beach car park.\n\nBorn with spina bifida, the 38-year-old from Frankston, on the outer eastern fringe of Melbourne, has used a wheelchair for most of her life.\n\nBeach matting allows people who use wheelchairs to reach the water's edge. (Supplied)\n\n\"I've never actually been able to get down onto the beach on my own\u2026 I would have to be up on the concrete just watching,\" she said.\n\nBut an Australian-first pilot to create the nation's first fully-accessible beach has given Burns, and 30,000 other Frankston residents living with a disability, a newfound ability to enjoy the beach in the same way millions of others across the country do.\n\n\"I have family that would carry me [in the past], but to be able to do it myself is amazing,\" Burns said.\n\nAccessible Beaches Australia and Frankston Council unveiled the nation's most accessible beach to users and supporters on December 5.\n\nThe three-month pilot includes 70 metres of beach matting running to the water's edge to allow wheelchairs to traverse the sand, daybeds with cabanas, five beach wheelchairs, two beach walkers, and a hoist to support transfers between wheelchairs.\n\nOut of the 160 accessible beaches in Australia, Frankston is the first to have staff and volunteers to help beachgoers enter and exit the water.\n\nFor participant Chris Wiggett, swimming at the beach was an opportunity more than seven years in the making.\ufeff\n\n\"Last time I was knocked over, which frightened me,\" she said at the pilot launch.\n\n\"This morning, a volunteer helped me down to the water. I put my feet in and walked along the sand, and I cried, because it was the first time in years I could do that.\"\n\n'A new level of inclusion'\n\nOther beaches across Australia are increasing their accessibility, with some offering beach mats, wheelchairs and accessible changerooms and parking.\n\nBut the mission to create a fully accessible beach in Australia was a dream first imagined nearly 10 years ago by Accessible Beaches Australia founder Shane Hryhorec.\n\nHryhorec grew up in South Australia, where he spent his days patrolling Grange Beach as a surf lifesaver.\n\nBut after breaking his neck in a swimming pool accident in 2007, Hryhorec became an incomplete quadriplegic aged 21.\n\nAfter his accident, he says the beach quickly became a place he avoided.\n\n\"I just instantly had to stop all the things that I liked to do that I would no longer be able to do, and one of those things that first came into my mind was the beach,\" he said.\n\n\"I just instantly wrote it off in my mind.\n\n\"I tried to go to the beach a few times after my accident, and I just found it very, very difficult, to the point where ... the challenge of it just became too great.\"\n\nAlmost 10 years later, Hryhorec was scrolling the internet when he came across a photo of a beach mat.\n\n\"I was blown away, and at that point I was like, we need this in Australia,\" he said.\n\nAccessible Beaches Australia founder Shane Hryhorec (left) with former Frankston City Council mayor Kris Bolam and Accessible Beaches Australia's Bern Walker. (Facebook)\n\nFrom there, he created Accessible Beaches Australia, which led him to visit the world's most accessible beach in Antibes, in the south of France, 18 months ago.\n\n\"They went to a new level of inclusion that I've never seen before,\" Hryhorec said.\n\n\"I didn't realise we could be doing so much better until I experienced the best.\"\n\nHryhorec hopes the inclusion of daybeds and volunteer staff can also encourage the ageing population to visit the beach - a sight he said \"warmed [his] heart\" in Antibes.\n\n\"Literally half of the people that were enjoying the beach were probably around their 80s or above, which I just thought was just so special,\" he said of the French Handiplage.\n\n\"People just assume when they get older is that they just can't go to the beach, especially if you don't have someone to go with, or a partner might have passed or something,\" he said.\ufeff\n\n\"When you're seeing our ageing population get to experience the beach, which they may not have been able to do for 10, 15, even 20 years, then that for me is what really grabs at my heartstrings.\"\n\nThe push for accessible beaches nationwide\ufeff\n\nHryhorec credits much of the success of the summer pilot program to Frankston City Council, which worked with the local community to raise $200,000 to bring it to fruition.\n\n\"I've been doing this work for nearly 10 years, making beaches accessible, and I've never seen a council and community get behind something with so much passion and enthusiasm and compassion,\" he said.\n\n\"If other communities could just be a smidgen of what Frankston is, what they could achieve for inclusion would be incredible around the country.\"\n\nThe Australian-first pilot features accessible beach amenities including beach wheelchairs and walkers. (Facebook)\n\nFrankston City councillor Kris Bolam, who just finished his tenure as mayor, said he hopes the pilot \"becomes the spark that inspires similar programs across Australia\".\n\n\"Hearing families say this is the first time they'll be able to visit the beach together is incredibly moving. That's the real success of today,\" he said.\n\nThat's a goal shared by Hryhorec and Burns.\n\n\"My hope is that every patrolled beach in the entire country has a level of accessibility on the beach, just like in Frankston,\" Hryhorec said.\n\n\"I hope that others would be able to get the same opportunity that I have been able to get, and I would recommend that they do it,\" Burns said.\n\nCarly Burns, 38, was the first person to use the beach wheelchairs at Frankston beach. (Frankston City Council)\n\nUntil then, Burns is looking forward to her first summer at the beach.\n\n\"I have young nieces and nephews, so it will be good to be able to join them in the water rather than having to just sit back and watch.\"",

        "text": "Brigitte Bardot, the French 1960s sex symbol who became one of the greatest screen sirens of the 20th century and later a militant animal rights activist, has died. She was 91.\n\nBardot died Sunday at her home in southern France, according to Bruno Jacquelin, of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals.\n\nSpeaking to The Associated Press, he gave no cause of death, and said no arrangements have yet been made for funeral or memorial services.\n\nFrench actress Brigitte Bardot poses with a huge sombrero she brought back from Mexico, as she arrives at Orly Airport in Paris, France, on May 27, 1965 (AP Photo)\n\nShe had been hospitalised last month.\n\nBardot became an international celebrity as a sexualized teen bride in the 1956 movie And God Created Woman . Directed by her then-husband, Roger Vadim, it triggered a scandal with scenes of the long-legged beauty dancing on tables naked.\n\nAt the height of a cinema career that spanned some 28 films and three marriages, Bardot came to symbolise a nation bursting out of bourgeois respectability. Her tousled, blond hair, voluptuous figure and pouty irreverence made her one of France's best-known stars.\n\nSuch was her widespread appeal that in 1969 her features were chosen to be the model for \"Marianne\", a bare-breasted statue representing the French Republic, and the official Gallic seal. Bardot's face appeared on statues, postage stamps and even on coins.\n\n''We are mourning a legend,'' French President Emmanuel Macron wrote Sunday on X.\n\nFrench actress Brigitte Bardot poses in character from the motion picture \"Voulez-Vous Danser Avec Moi\" (Do you Want to Dance With Me), on Sept. 10, 1959. (AP)\n\nBardot's second career as an animal rights activist was equally sensational. She travelled to the Arctic to blow the whistle on the slaughter of baby seals; she condemned the use of animals in laboratory experiments; and she opposed Muslim slaughter rituals.\n\n\"Man is an insatiable predator,\" Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday, in 2007.\n\n\"I don't care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself.\"\n\nHer activism earned her compatriots' respect and, in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honour, the nation's highest honour.\n\nA turn to the far right\n\nLater, however, she fell from public grace as her animal protection diatribes took on a decidedly extremist tone. She frequently decried the influx of immigrants into France, especially Muslims.\n\nShe was convicted and fined five times in French courts of inciting racial hatred, in incidents inspired by her opposition to the Muslim practice of slaughtering sheep during annual religious holidays.\n\nBardot's 1992 marriage to fourth husband Bernard d'Ormale, a onetime adviser to former National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen, contributed to her political shift. She described the outspoken nationalist as a \"lovely, intelligent man\".\n\nFrench film legend and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot looks on prior to a march of various animal rights associations on March 24, 2007 in Paris (AP Photo/Jacques Brinon)\n\nIn 2012, she wrote a letter in support of the presidential bid of Marine Le Pen, who now leads her father's renamed National Rally party. Le Pen paid homage Sunday to an \"exceptional woman\" who was \"incredibly French\".\n\nIn 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Bardot said in an interview that most actors protesting sexual harassment in the film industry were \"hypocritical\" and \"ridiculous\" because many played \"the teases\" with producers to land parts.\n\nShe said she had never had been a victim of sexual harassment and found it \"charming to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass\".\n\nA privileged, but 'difficult' upbringing\n\nBrigitte Anne-Marie Bardot was born September 28, 1934, to a wealthy industrialist. A shy, secretive child, she studied classical ballet and was discovered by a family friend who put her on the cover of Elle magazine at age 14.\n\nBardot once described her childhood as \"difficult\" and said her father was a strict disciplinarian who would sometimes punish her with a horse whip.\n\nBut it was French movie producer Vadim, whom she married in 1952, who saw her potential and wrote And God Created Woman to showcase her provocative sensuality, an explosive cocktail of childlike innocence and raw sexuality.\n\nBrigitte Bardot in And God Created Woman (Criterion, Cocinor/ YouTube)\n\nThe film, which portrayed Bardot as a bored newlywed who beds her brother-in-law, had a decisive influence on New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut, and came to embody the hedonism and sexual freedom of the 1960s.\n\nThe film was a box-office hit, and it made Bardot a superstar. Her girlish pout, tiny waist and generous bust were often more appreciated than her talent.\n\n\"It's an embarrassment to have acted so badly,\" Bardot said of her early films.\n\n\"I suffered a lot in the beginning. I was really treated like someone less than nothing.\"\n\nBardot's unabashed, off-screen love affair with co-star Jean-Louis Trintignant further shocked the nation. It eradicated the boundaries between her public and private life and turned her into a hot prize for paparazzi.\n\nBrigitte Bardot, in a striped dress, in the 1950s. (Getty)\n\nBardot never adjusted to the limelight. She blamed the constant press attention for the suicide attempt that followed 10 months after the birth of her only child, Nicolas. Photographers had broke into her house only two weeks before she gave birth to snap a picture of her pregnant.\n\nNicolas' father was Jacques Charrier, a handsome French actor whom she married in 1959 but who never felt comfortable in his role as Monsieur Bardot. Bardot soon gave up her son to his father, and later said she had been chronically depressed and unready for the duties of being a mother.\n\n\"I was looking for roots then,\" she said in an interview. \"I had none to offer.\"\n\nIn her 1996 autobiography Initiales B.B. , she likened her pregnancy to \"a tumour growing inside me,\" and described Charrier as \"temperamental and abusive\".\n\nActress Brigitte Bardot, 23, gets a hug from her new husband, actor Jacques Charrier, also 23, following their wedding here, June 18th. The marriage was slightly delayed by a swarm of newsmen who were waiting for the pair to arrive gor their \"Secret wedding.\" Rumors that Brigitte and Charrier were married have blown hot and cold during the last five days, with the pair adding to the confusion by both denying and confirming reports. Now it is cer (Bettmann Archive)\n\nBardot married her third husband, West German millionaire playboy Gunther Sachs, in 1966, but the relationship again ended in divorce three years later.\n\nAmong her films were A Parisian (1957); In Case of Misfortune , in which she starred in 1958 with screen legend Jean Gabin; The Truth (1960); Private Life (1962); A Ravishing Idiot (1964); Shalako (1968); Women (1969); The Bear And The Doll (1970); Rum Boulevard (1971); and Don Juan (1973).\n\nWith the exception of 1963's critically acclaimed Contempt , directed by Godard, Bardot's films were rarely complicated by plots. Often they were vehicles to display Bardot's curves and legs in scanty dresses or frolicking nude in the sun.\n\n\"It was never a great passion of mine,\" she said of filmmaking.\n\n\"And it can be deadly sometimes. Marilyn [Monroe] perished because of it.\"\n\nBardot retired to her Riviera villa in St. Tropez at the age of 39 in 1973 after The Woman Grabber .\n\nFrench actress Brigitte Bardot relaxes in the back of a limousine upon her arrival at London's Heathrow Airport. She has flown in from Paris to attend the premiere of her latest film 'Shalako', in which she plays an alluring countess. (Photo by Central Press/Getty Images) (Getty)\n\nReinventing herself in middle age\n\nShe emerged a decade later with a new persona: An animal rights lobbyist, her face was wrinkled and her voice was deep following years of heavy smoking.\n\nShe abandoned her jet-set life and sold off movie memorabilia and jewellery to create a foundation devoted exclusively to the prevention of animal cruelty.\n\nHer activism knew no borders. She urged South Korea to ban the sale of dog meat and once wrote to US President Bill Clinton asking why the US Navy recaptured two dolphins it had released into the wild.\n\nShe attacked centuries-old French and Italian sporting traditions including the Palio, a free-for-all horse race, and campaigned on behalf of wolves, rabbits, kittens and turtle doves.\n\nFollowing news of her death, PETA Founder Ingrid Newkirk praised her activism and labelled the late actress \"a strong voice for all species\".\n\n\"From her rescued pigeons in Saint-Tropez to her beloved dogs, PETA will miss Brigitte, an angel for animals who went to bat and to court to protect them all,\" Newkirk said in a statement.\ufeff\n\nFormer Actress And Now Animals Rights Activist Brigitte Bardot Invited For A Meeting On The Environment With French President Nicolas Sarkozy, At The Elysee Palace In Paris, France On September 27, 2007 - (Photo by Gilles BASSIGNAC/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images) (Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images)\n\nBy the late 1990s, Bardot was making headlines that would lose her many fans. She was convicted and fined five times between 1997 and 2008 for inciting racial hatred in incidents inspired by her anger at Muslim animal slaughtering rituals.\n\n\"It's true that sometimes I get carried away, but when I see how slowly things move forward ... and despite all the promises that have been made to me by all different governments put together \u2014 my distress takes over,\" Bardot told the AP.\n\nIn 1997, several towns removed Bardot-inspired statues of Marianne after the actress voiced anti-immigrant sentiment. Also that year, she received death threats after calling for a ban on the sale of horse meat.\n\nBardot once said that she identified with the animals that she was trying to save.\n\n\"I can understand hunted animals because of the way I was treated,\" Bardot said.\n\n\"What happened to me was inhuman. I was constantly surrounded by the world press.\"",

(Supplied)\n\nInstead she ended up ghostwriting for \ufeffmore than four years.\n\n\ufeffFor those not in the know, a ghostwriter is a professional author paid to write books (among other things) for other authors, celebrities, even royals.\n\nPrince Harry's Spare was ghostwritten by acclaimed journalist and author J. R. Moehringer, who reportedly charges seven figures per book.\n\nOther, less established ghostwriters make tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars per book\ufeff.\n\nThe trade-off is that most receive no credit for what they write because it's published under someone else's name (celebrity \ufeffghostwriters such as Moehringer are outliers).\n\nBut Kelly, a self-proclaimed \"lover of words\", didn't mind writing for other people at first.\n\nREAD MORE: Three words this CEO swears will help you land a better job \ufeff\n\nJ. R. Moehringer, the ghostwriter behind Prince Harry's Spare, is one of few ghostwriters who can be open about what they've ghostwritten.

(Supplied)\n\n\ufeffLike most jobs, ghostwriting gigs are advertised online with details such as the genre of the book, the level of experience required, and the rate of pay.\n\nAnd almost all of them require the hired ghostwriter to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) prohibiting them from ever revealing they wrote it.\n\nKelly had to sign one for every single book she worked on, but the cash was worth it.\n\nBefore long, she was ghostwriting for \ufeffmajor publishers in the US and UK, as well as a few authors directly.\n\nAs her profile increased, so did her pay.\n\n\ufeff\"I would negotiate the overall amount, then get paid in milestones,\" she explained.\n\n\"It started with the outline, then it was usually in 10,000- to 20,000-word increments, and then for any further edits.\"\ufeff\n\nGhostwriting can be a lucrative side hustle for Aussies willing to put in the work. (Getty)\n\nIt became a lucrative side hustle and when Kelly landed a \ufefffull-time job in the disability sector in 2021, she decided to keep ghostwriting.\n\nHaving an extra income as the \ufeffcost-of-living crisis was kicking off was a huge relief.\n\nEspecially when Kelly and her husband learned they were expecting their first child the following year.\n\nIt was a challenging juggle and Kelly had to \ufeffwrite before and after work and on her lunch breaks to meet tight project deadlines.\ufeff\n\n\"Whenever I had a spare moment, I was writing,\" she said, describing it as \"exhausting but fulfilling\".\n\n\"Then on weekends I smashed out as much as I could.\"\n\nThe only drawback was that Kelly had no ownership of her writing, even on the projects where she was given almost total creative freedom.\n\nKelly had to \ufeffwrite before and after work and on her lunch breaks while juggling ghostwriting with a full-time role. (Supplied)\n\nFor one project, she was given a vague theme and allowed to run wild with it for three books.\n\nBut as soon as the ink dried, her words were taken away to be published under a stranger's name.\ufeff\n\n\"That's the one series I wish I could've put my name on, because it had so much of me in it and I still to this day have no idea where it ended up,\" Kelly said.\n\nOf the 20 books she ghostwrote, Kelly has only ever found two on shelves \u2013 both by accident.\n\nWhat happened to the rest remains a mystery.\ufeff\n\nIt was only after becoming a mother that Kelly decided to finally step away from ghostwriting after more than four years.\n\n\"It was incredibly draining to give pieces of myself - my humour, my creativity, even my trauma - to other people's books,\" she explained.\n\n\"I started to question why I was bringing other people's stories to life but not the ones that I've been carrying around inside of me.\"\ufeff\n\nKelly decided to step away from ghostwriting after welcoming her daughter. (Supplied)\n\n\ufeffHoping to show her daughter that it's never too late to chase your passions, Kelly is now writing original fiction between part-time work and raising a toddler.\n\nBut she doesn't regret her time as a ghostwriter.\n\n\"This has all led me to a path where I'm working on my own writing, and I'm excited to see where it leads me,\" she said.\n\n\"It could lead to a pile of books that never see the light of day, but at least I put pen to paper.\"\n\nHave you got a story?

(Getty Images: Hamish Blair)\n\n\"It's sort of at an odd time, if there's a series straight on the back of this, then it would be a little bit different.\"\n\nEven though he has played more than a decade in Queensland, Khawaja grew up in Sydney after moving from Pakistan with his family at an early age and made his Test debut at the SCG back in 2011.\n\nThere have been numerous memorable farewells \u2014 Steve Waugh, Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Justin Langer \u2014 at the venue given it is usually the last Test of the summer.\n\nKhawaja would be warmly received by the Sydney crowd should he decide it is his last Test.\n\n\"We use Davey Warner as a test case, he got clapped off the SCG three years in a row because everyone thought it was going to be his last Test match,\" McDonald said.\n\n\"If Uz makes no statement around his future leading into that Test match, that crowd will still be very supportive of him.\n\n\"Our challenge is if any of our great players retire, is that you want to acknowledge them.\"\n\nAustralia's shaky batters face SCG selection scrutiny Jake Weatherald, Marnus Labuschagne and Cameron Green all face selection pressure following double failures in Australia's jarring loss at the MCG.\n\nAfter losing their first home Ashes Test for 15 years with a two-day defeat at the MCG, Australia are desperate to complete a 4-1 series win and bank valuable World Test Championship points.\n\nOpener Jake Weatherald, number three Marnus Labuschagne and all-rounder Cameron Green are all going through lean patches with the bat.\n\nBut Australia will almost certainly stick with the trio, with Green's potential replacement, Beau Webster, released to play in the Big Bash League before the SCG Test.\n\nOff-spinner Todd Murphy looms as a likely inclusion after Australia picked four specialist fast bowlers at the MCG.\n\nJhye Richardson, who was brought in for his first Test in four years, would likely make way for Murphy if the SCG pitch is not another paradise for seamers.\n\nAAP",

You can plan for your perfect race, but things are bound to happen if you get hit by a wave, eat a buoy, or the wind's really bad.\"\n\nTeam cox Ryder Taylor knew the competition didn't expect the Australians to perform as well as they did because they rarely compete compared with their European counterparts.\n\n\u200b\"We weren't really expected to medal, but as a crew we all knew we could do it.

Contradictions and causation, chaos and change.\n\nMarkets are at record highs, but it doesn't feel like a party because so many people aren't invited.\n\nWait, hold on \u2014 the World Trade Uncertainty Index is higher than it was during the COVID-19 pandemic or the global financial crisis. And gold is at record highs as well, up 67 per cent in a year!\n\nThat's what people buy when they fear the world will fall apart.\n\nMeanwhile, our corporate regulator is investigating our (essentially) monopoly stock market provider \u2014 the ASX \u2014 after \"repeated and serious failures\", a phrase you could have said about it any time for the past decade.\n\n(I reckon the time last year when ASIC sued the stock market operator for misleadingly saying a project to replace its systems was \"progressing well\" probably flagged that things weren't \"progressing well\").\n\nOur global collective worry rocketed after US President Donald Trump \u2014 who in words, advertisements and deeds had promised substantial tariffs on friends, neighbours and enemies \u2014 did something truly shocking to global traders: announcing tariffs on friends, neighbours and enemies.\n\nDonald Trump's first year back in the White House has been full of economic surprises. (Reuters: Elizabeth Frantz)\n\nMarkets slumped, chaos reigned, penguins on remote uninhabited islands shivered as tariffs were slapped on their non-existent exports to the United States.\n\nThe only certainty from then onwards: uncertainty.\n\nParty time \u2014 right?\n\nThe Nasdaq index of mega-tech stocks is up 17 per cent from the already elevated level where it started in January.\n\nChaotic 'up-crash' for markets in 2025 It's been a big year of economic shocks and surges as the international framework of global trade was shredded. Here's how key players saw the year than was.\n\nThe so-called Magnificent Seven artificial intelligence-exposed companies are pumping cash and optimism through markets. (Let's ignore the fact one of the most talked-about books this year is If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies: The Case Against Superintelligent AI).\n\nOur ASX 200 group of the 200 largest listed companies is up 4.5 per cent \u2014 and it would have been more but for a wobble since October.\n\nIt's what George Tharenou of global investment fund UBS told me was an \"up crash\", with assets like share markets and property just heading skywards.\n\n'It's almost a detachment from fundamentals'\n\nTharenou called it FOMO: the fear of missing out.\n\nAnd he's not the only one suspicious of what seems like an empty boom in a dangerous time.\n\nAnalysts and experts talk about \"2008 vibes\" \u2014 what things felt like in the time just before the global financial crisis crushed the world economy. (It took 12 years for the ASX 200 to again reach the level it was at before the crisis).\n\nThe government's sovereign wealth store, the Future Fund, has $250 billion under management. Chief executive Raphael Arndt told The Australian Financial Review the year felt like a \"perpetual inflection point \u2014 a permacrisis if you like\".\n\n\" The weaponisation of trade, the persistence of inflation, climate shocks and a rising cost of capital \u2014 these all have tested the very assumptions that underpin investment theory. \"\n\nWe keep shredding economic norms.\n\nThat crushing inflation requires unemployment to rise.\n\nThat increasing cost of trade, tariffs, will crimp gross domestic product (GDP) growth (although that still might happen).\n\nThat gold booms when the market is falling.\n\nAnd here's the biggest thing. We're talking about the \"business\" economy, the indices, the returns. They do affect people's lives. However, there's a lot more to it.\n\nThere are far bigger forces at play.\n\nYou aren't meant to know these incredibly obvious things people are talking about\n\nEvery time there's an election, the public service writes a manual for the incoming minister.\n\nThere's a \"Red Book\" in case of a Labor win and a \"Blue Book\" if the Coalition wins.\n\nIn May, Labor didn't just win; the Coalition was banished. In our two most populous cities, Sydney and Melbourne, there are collectively just three Liberal-held seats that don't include farmland in them. Three.\n\nThese so-called incoming government briefs are an honest look at issues facing the minister in their portfolio and are created for an audience of one: that person.\n\nSo I still kind of feel for the Treasury body that accidentally emailed me the one that only Jim Chalmers was meant to read.\n\nFearless and free, the Treasury isn't holding back \u2014 and that's good for everyone The persistence of Treasury officials in trying to get an innocuous document deleted served to highlight there was something there.\n\nBlunt doesn't cover what it told Jim, and we told you:\n\nYou need to lift taxes\n\nYou need to cut spending\n\nYour key election promise, building 1.2 million homes? Not going to happen (unless you massively change things immediately)\n\nChalmers said he was \"relaxed\" about the release of the advice, which described actions most government economists, journalists and the data were all across.\n\nJim Chalmers faces big challenges in 2026. (ABC News: David Sciasci)\n\n(Without labouring the point, the lawyers were less relaxed about it).\n\nBut it wasn't even the most impactful brief.\n\nBuried in the manual for Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek was this missile: There's a boomer boom as poor and middle-income people subsidise the incomes of older rich people.\n\nLiterally:\n\n\" Low and middle-income earners are subsidising the retirement incomes of seniors with significant wealth in addition to their homes. \"\n\nThink about that. Poor people are subsidising the income of older non-working people who are significantly wealthy beyond owning their house.\n\nPeople who don't need help are getting support from people who do.\n\nBeyond being unfair, it is poisoning the well.\n\n\"The majority of Australians believe current income distribution is unfair,\" the brief reads, having been obtained using the Freedom of Information (FOI) process.\n\n\"This appears to be affecting views on democracy, as fewer people believe hard work leads to a better life.\"\n\nWe've tilted the playing field.\n\nJob mobility is at decades-low levels as people stay put, imperilled by a tax system that makes buying and selling houses extremely expensive, tying people to mortgages so massive they dissuade people from taking risks.\n\nMeanwhile, people with home loans are still getting smashed by high repayments.\n\nThe RBA dropped interest rates three times during 2025. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nFor all of 2024, the Reserve Bank's key interest rate stayed the same. Early this year it stuttered marginally lower \u2014 just as public anger was becoming white hot \u2014 going lower two more times, before flatlining again.\n\nThe RBA is now flagging its economy-throttling interest rates probably haven't beaten inflation.\n\nNo real shock. Lots of that cost-of-living pressure is driven by longer-term issues like the messy but necessary energy transition and climate-change-fuelled insurance cost surges.\n\nBeyond that, we're seeing the hard-to-squash price rises of an economy where productivity is increasingly reliant on services provided by humans rather than machines that can squeeze widgets out faster.\n\nWorkers get slapped with accusations of slackness as our productivity rate stutters, despite the obvious and contentious nature of even agreeing on the measurement of the concept in rapidly expanding fields like health care, the NDIS and teaching.\n\nLoading\n\nIncreasingly, your circumstances are divined by your housing situation, how you make your income (Wages? Schmuck. Assets? Genius) and are divorced from the effort you're putting in.\n\nYounger people are being saddled with debt (personal and government), face the dizzying cost of dealing with the climate crisis, and then there's housing \u2026 a crisis that is literally consuming the waking thoughts of millions.\n\nAI bubbles. Tariff turmoil. Market moves. They're all substantial, and they've shaped our lives in 2025.\n\nThis year, next year and beyond, the biggest question for an increasing number of Australians is less ethereal and more practical: How are we going to make this work?\n\nWith that, I wish you all the best for a wonderful 2026.\n\nThanks to our audience across Australia and beyond. A special thanks for all the people who've spoken to me and my ABC colleagues, so we that we can talk about business, the economy and how they impact your life.\n\nHere's to peace and joy for the year ahead.",

(Supplied)\n\nThe role of city branches for a country organisation\n\nFor fellow member Sonia Martin, 33, who grew up in the Northern Rivers and moved to Sydney in her late schooling years, she too was looking for a sense of community.\n\n\"Sydney is so different \u2014 you don't know your neighbours, you don't have people around as much and I didn't have my parents or siblings here,\" she said.\n\nSo, six years ago, she joined the CWA.\n\n\"Being surrounded by a group of women who are both like-minded but also diverse in life experience is just something I haven't found before,\" Ms Martin said.\n\n\"I think because there are women of varying ages, there are those intergenerational conversations that you might not get anywhere other than the workplace or within your family.\"\n\nMs Martin (left) says having intergenerational conversations with other women in the branch has been a highlight. (Supplied)\n\nMs Martin sees the metropolitan branches' roles as garnering support for the wider CWA causes \u2014 namely, healthcare accessibility, domestic violence awareness, education, combating social isolation and supporting local communities.\n\n\"In New South Wales, the population is majority in the city. So if you're looking at metro areas, creating awareness of what the CWA is doing in the regions and rural areas is really important for the future of it.\"\n\nVice president of the CWA Sydney City Branch, Alicia Kell, said there were seven CWA branches in the metropolitan Sydney area, such as Eastwood and Georges River.\n\nAlicia Kell says the CWA hopes to represent women throughout NSW. (ABC News: Patrick Thomas)\n\nWith one member over 90 and about 10 members in the 18 to 34 bracket in the city branch, Ms Kell said she felt proud to be part of a diverse group.\n\n\"We need younger, middle-aged and older members. We all learn from each other and that's the lovely thing about it,\" she said.\n\n\"We want to represent women throughout NSW.\"\n\nAs Ms Martin said of joining a community group: \"Take a chance, check it out, and you might be really pleasantly surprised.\"",

        "text": "Peak eating disorder bodies are raising concerns about the rapid rollout of GLP-1 weight-loss treatments through telehealth, and what they describe as aggressive social media marketing by some companies.\n\nIn one case, a company referred to \"pesky Aussie laws\" as having prevented it from providing more information about the medication to potential customers.\n\nThe Australia and New Zealand Academy for Eating Disorders said it was concerned such marketing techniques could target people who might not need the medication.\n\n\"Very, very little medical monitoring, or medical history [is] being taken [by telehealth],\" chief executive officer Jade Gooding said.\n\nLoading...\n\nBrisbane-based Ms Gooding said eating disorder groups were aware of people misusing the medication and accessing it when they should not have.\n\n\" We hold concerns about how these particular medications are being prescribed by [telehealth providers]. \"\n\nInternational company Juniper is among their concerns, having run a recent Black Friday sale.\n\nJuniper is part of EUC Management, also known as Eucalyptus, which has operations in Australia, the UK, Germany and Japan.\n\nIts revenue more than doubled to $248 million last financial year, according to accounts filed for 2025 with regulators.\n\nIt still lost $25 million last year, and its biggest cost was marketing at $86.1 million, almost tripling from the year before.\n\nA screenshot of a Black Friday sale advertisement on a website for telehealth company Juniper. (Supplied)\n\nA company that operates under the same umbrella, Pilot, sells similar medical weight-loss treatments but targets a male audience, while Juniper targets women.\n\nPractitioners from both companies can prescribe Ozempic-style drugs, including Wegovy (semaglutide) and Mounjaro (tirzepatide).\n\nBlack Friday sales and 'pesky Aussie laws'\n\nThe ABC asked Juniper about a past Black Friday sale and how it related to prescription medication, after advertisements promoting the sale included discount codes and marketing emails.\n\nEucalyptus clinical director Matt Vickers said in a statement, \"any promotional activity relates solely to the cost of accessing our medical service, not the cost of a prescription medication\".\n\nJuniper sent various \"Black Friday\" sale content to its patients. (Supplied)\n\nBrisbane student Evangeline Gardiner was among those who said they had been \"bombarded\" with advertisements.\n\n\"It does make me feel like they only care about sales; they don't care about me or my health as an individual person,\" she said.\n\nThe 30-year-old, who had previously experienced disordered eating, said she found the advertisements particularly triggering.\n\n\"You'd never see a Black Friday sale for a pap smear or a cancer screening or skin check,\" she said.\n\n\"It really doesn't sit right for me. You could have a Black Friday sale for something like that.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nThe ABC sighted comments on Juniper's Facebook page, which included one response that told a user the company would direct message them with further information because of \"pesky Aussie laws\".\n\nIn Australia, strict laws prohibit the public advertising of prescription medicines.\n\nThe ABC does not suggest that Eucalyptus is breaching the law.\n\nJuniper says \"we regret the remark and acknowledge that it may have caused concern\". (Facebook)\n\nThe advertising restrictions do not capture promotion of a health service that does not promote any therapeutic good and only refers to the type of consultation the service offers.\n\nJuniper said the comment the company made on social media did not reflect the organisation's view or approach to regulations.\n\nThe company frequently replied to social media users, asking them to message privately for more information about the medical weight loss treatment.\n\n\"We take compliance seriously and fully support Australia's regulatory framework governing telehealth and prescription medicines,\" Dr Vickers said in a statement.\n\n\"We regret the remark and acknowledge that it may have caused concern.\n\n\"The comment has been removed, and we have reviewed our internal processes to inform improvements.\n\n\" We remain committed to high standards of clinical governance and regulatory compliance. \"\n\nDr Vickers said the previous Black Friday sale \"did not influence a clinician's decision to prescribe; eligibility is always determined through a structured clinical assessment\".\n\n\"We recognise that promotional activity in this space must be handled carefully, which is why our clinical safeguards and screening processes remain unchanged and consistently applied to every patient,\" he said.\n\nMatt Vickers says \"any promotional activity relates solely to the cost of accessing our medical service\". (Supplied)\n\nThe ABC also sighted logos for organisations, including the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) and the Australian College of Nurse Practitioners, on Juniper's website.\n\nAfter the ABC raised questions, the logos were removed.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the RACGP said \"weight loss medications should only be prescribed within clear clinical criteria and ongoing monitoring frameworks\".\n\nRACGP, ACHS and ACNP logos (above) were removed from Juniper's website following ABC questioning (below). (Supplied)\n\nThe ABC understands the RACGP does not provide endorsement to Juniper.\n\nDr Vickers said \"we previously displayed the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) logo to acknowledge that our prescribing workforce includes Fellows of the College\".\n\nMarkets feel the Ozempic effect The rise of weight loss drugs is changing how we eat and pushing pharmaceutical giants into trillion-dollar valuations.\n\n\"To avoid any misunderstanding or perception that the college formally endorses our operations, the logo has now been removed,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe Australian Council on Healthcare Standards logo was also removed after questioning.\n\nThe council said it accredited Eucalyptus.\n\nStronger safeguards needed\n\nExecutive director of Eating Disorders Families Australia Jane Rowan said stronger safeguards were needed to access medical weight-loss treatments.\n\nAustralia's medicines regulator recently issued a safety warning over the potential risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviours when taking these drugs.\n\nShe said there also needed to be \"more rigour\" around the advertising of medical weight-loss treatments and that, in her view, the federal government needed to be involved.\n\n\"I think when these companies are advertising as widely as they are without considerations of the vulnerable people out there \u2014 those who may be at risk of developing an eating disorder \u2014 that's a real problem, and we certainly need regulations to address.\"\n\nMs Rowan, who has type 1 diabetes, was prescribed Ozempic by her endocrinologist in September 2023 as part of her diabetes management.\n\nShe said her work in the eating disorder space meant she understood both the need for the medication and the importance of regulation.\n\n\"There's certainly a place for these medications, but they do need to be done under close supervision and for appropriate medical reasons.\"\n\nJane Rowan was prescribed Ozempic by her endocrinologist as part of her diabetes management. (ABC News: Shari Hams)\n\nThe Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) said the government was not able to comment on whether the companies mentioned were engaging in unlawful advertising of therapeutic goods.\n\nThe ABC also contacted federal Health Minister Mark Butler, who responded in conjunction with the TGA.\n\n\"Under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 [the act], it is an offence to advertise a therapeutic good where the advertisement 'refers to' a prescription-only medicine,\" a TGA spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nNone of the companies' advertising mentioned any prescription-only medicine.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe spokesperson said the TGA strongly urged Australians using or considering weight-loss products \u2014 especially from overseas or online \u2014 to check safety alerts and speak with a health professional to ensure their safety.\n\nThe TGA also said it did not regulate the advertising or provision of health services, with those matters falling under the remit of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA).\n\nAn AHPRA spokesperson said, in a statement, that legislation limited what the regulator could say about individual practitioners or matters, outside of information published on the register or in tribunal decisions.\n\nSpeaking generally, the regulator said disciplinary action had been taken against some practitioners, including cautions and conditions placed on their registration, over concerns about prescribing to vulnerable patients with disordered eating.\n\n\" We do not regulate companies or services, but our action against practitioners has also led telehealth providers to change their business practices. \"\n\nThe TGA says the government could not comment on whether the companies were engaging in unlawful advertising of therapeutic goods. (ABC News: Shari Hams)\n\nComprehensive clinical safeguards\n\nDr Vickers said Juniper and Pilot had comprehensive clinical safeguards to ensure people with active or emerging eating disorders were not prescribed weight-management medications.\n\n\"Every patient is required to undertake a detailed medical questionnaire, followed by an in-depth phone or video consultation with an AHPRA-registered healthcare practitioner, who conducts a full history, risk assessment, and eligibility screen, including assessing BMI via verified video or photos, before any treatment is considered,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThere are concerns people with restrictive eating disorders could access weight-loss treatments (Reuters: Hollie Adams)\n\n\"As part of our safeguard measures, we are also rolling out a live photo-verification system, further strengthening the clinical screening process. The system is scheduled to be fully implemented by the end of January 2026.\"\n\nWeight-loss drug manufacturers under fire for 'unethical' ads Two pharmaceutical giants have recently launched advertisements directing people towards their doctor for weight loss. Some experts warn this type of advertising may affect public health messaging.\n\nHe added that practitioners receive extra training to identify red flags, recognise early disordered eating, and manage weight stigma and body image concerns.\n\n\"Where concerns arise, medication is not prescribed, and patients are redirected to appropriate care and support,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Ongoing monitoring of medical weight-loss patients, follow-up and access to multidisciplinary support form part of our broader care model to ensure that treatment remains clinically appropriate and safe.\"\n\nBut eating disorder advocates said these measures were not enough and that in-person consultations should be mandated by law.\n\n\"What we are really concerned about is the ongoing medical monitoring of people who are taking these medications,\" Ms Gooding said.\n\n\"What we really need is for our government to implement legislation for the safe prescribing of these medications.\n\n\"With these business models, follow-ups don't always include the same doctor, and it certainly doesn't include the same clinician. There's a few things we are pushing for, that all appointments require a visual or face-to-face assessment.\"",

This year, it was on. It was neck and neck,\" he said.\n\nHe said the winning boat was an \"engineering feat\".\n\n\"This is a 100-foot boat. The mast is 150 feet high. The whole boat's made of carbon,\" he said.\n\n\"Master Lock Comanche is the most iconic boat in the world.\n\n\"To get through those conditions \u2026 are pretty brutal at times.\n\n\"When you're spearing off waves that are 10 or 15 metres, and then landing, and the whole boat just shatters, I think to myself, 'How do I explain this to people that aren't on here?'\"\n\nMaster Lock Comanche crosses the finish line.

        "text": "The ABC has travelled more than 550 kilometres across regional Victoria and South Australia to find out whether drivers are still giving courtesy waves along our highways and country roads.\n\nThe \"wave test drive\" started in Mildura in Victoria's north-west, through the towns of Ouyen, Speed, Patchewollock, Walpeup, and along the Mallee Highway before crossing the South Australian border, with the driver waving at every passing vehicle.\n\nFrom there, the ABC headed north to Loxton via Pinnaroo, through Swan Reach and Blanchetown before finally arriving at Truro, a town 80km north-east of Adelaide.\n\nThe results showed an uncertain future for the courtesy wave, with drivers from just 33 of the 374 vehicles the ABC passed waving back.\n\nOn the highways, 25 waved back from 362 vehicles, while eight out of 12 waved on the back roads.\n\nSome truck drivers and country people have noticed fewer drivers giving out courtesy waves. (ABC News: Amelia Walters)\n\nEven though the results were a small sample of Australia's road network, it highlighted that while the wave might be declining on highways, it remained strong on back roads between small towns.\n\nHowever, locals had differing opinions on the future of the wave.\n\nSpeed local Meredith Rowney said the wave had decreased in regularity over time, but the type of road a person was travelling on mattered.\n\n\"If you're in a small country town where you know people, you are more likely to wave than in the bigger centres where you don't know people,\" Ms Rowney said.\n\n\"I think living locally, we see our friends driving past us, or our neighbours, so we wave to many people that pass us, as well as those that give way to us or do something kind.\"\n\nThe ABC tested how many drivers gave courtesy waves during a trip through Victoria and South Australia. (ABC News: Will Hunter)\n\nOuyen fuel tank driver Paul Dean said the wave happened regularly, but more likely between towns.\n\n\"Country people are still country people; everyone waves to everyone,\" Mr Dean said.\n\n\" [If] I see a white ute, nine times out of 10 that's going to be a local farmer, so I better wave otherwise they might get crook at me later on and say you're bit of snob, you didn't wave, so I definitely try and wave and a lot of people wave back. \"\n\nNSW tourist Brad, who was travelling through Truro, said the gesture might be happening more often.\n\n\"My 13-year-old son is teaching me different forms of doing it, so if it's in his sphere, then more people are doing it,\" he said.\n\nInterstate driver sees a decline\n\nInterstate truck driver Pete Kelly has been in the industry for 40 years and said the wave had \"all but died off\".\n\n\"People seem to be in too much of a rush, without having any courtesy,\" Mr Kelly said.\n\n\"Back in the day, when I first started, it was there all the time, and drivers would acknowledge each other, whether you were overtaking or coming towards each other, you always acknowledged the other driver.\n\n\"[Even] car drivers \u2026 I rarely see [the wave] these days.\"\n\nPete Kelly says the friendly gesture has \"died off\". (Supplied: Pete Kelly)\n\nTruck driver and road safety advocate Rod Hannifey shared a similar view.\n\n\"[It] seems noticeable that it has dropped off,\" Mr Hannifey said.\n\n\"It's disappointing from the point of view that where we used to wave to truckies all the time, it was part of the mateship and the culture, and that seems to have died off \u2026 in one way that's a bad thing, [since] we are out there alone on the road.\n\nRod Hannifey is hoping to introduce a National Wave Day next year. (ABC News: Kenji Sato)\n\n\"There are a number of reasons for that; I suppose phones are probably a big one \u2026 in the past, we relied on UHF radio and before that CB [radio].\n\nMr Hannifey said a campaign had started in NSW called \"Wave to a Truckie\" to promote \"the wave\". He also hoped to introduce a National Wave Day next year.\n\nWave improves road safety\n\nAustralia Road Safety Foundation chair and founder Russell White said bringing back the wave could shift the road culture, which in recent years had dropped due to poor driver behaviour and increased road aggression.\n\nRussell White says bringing back the wave could help shift the road culture. (Supplied: ARSF)\n\n\"I guess there's been a general decrease in a whole stack of our more social connection mechanisms that we might have traditionally had,\" Mr White said.\n\n\"[The wave] resets that narrative a little bit \u2026 [and] could change the overall culture on the road, just one driver, one road user at a time.\"\n\nMr White said the friendly gesture would help with awareness on the road.\n\n\"I think anything that could re-establish a connection is probably a really good tool to improve the overall level of road safety awareness,\" he said.",

        "text": "These are not the first players to confront challenging conditions, and they will not be the last. Yet, in their petulance, they betray a profound ignorance of the game\u2019s storied past. Test cricket is not a fleeting entertainment; it is a legacy built brick by brick over nearly a century and a half. To disregard that history is to disrespect the format itself, and in doing so, they imperil its future. How many of these modern stars, cocooned in their bio-bubbles and lucrative contracts, pause to reflect on the warriors who preceded them? A doctor inspects Ric McCosker\u2019s broken jaw during the Centenary Test in 1977. Credit: Fairfax Media I doubt many of them recall the visceral heroism of Rick McCosker in the Centenary Test of 1977, a match that etched itself into the soul of Australian cricket. Let me take you back to that sweltering March at the MCG. The curator, Bill Watt, known fondly as \u2018Grassy\u2019 for his lush pitches, had been thwarted by unseasonal weather. The surface was damp, verdant, a bowler\u2019s paradise that spat like a cornered cobra.\n\nEngland captain Tony Greig won the toss and inserted Australia, a decision that unleashed carnage. Bob Willis, that lanky spearhead, hurled a bouncer that reared unpredictably from the damp surface, striking McCosker square on the jaw. The crack echoed around the ground; blood sprayed, and in a cruel irony, the ball deflected onto the stumps, dismissing him. His jaw shattered, McCosker was rushed to a hospital, his face a mask of agony. Australia limped to 138, pilloried by the press as inadequate. Australian batsman Rick McCosker playing with a broken jaw during the 1977 Centenary Test at the MCG. Credit: Fairfax Media As captain, I knew better. We had fought tooth and nail against a strong seam attack of Willis, JK Lever and Chris Old and the best damp wicket bowler of his era, Derek Underwood, on a demon of a track. If we bowled with fire, England would falter too. Thanks to Dennis Lillee and Max Walker, they did, handing us a precious 43-run first-innings lead. The pitch was improving, but in the early hours of our second innings, it still promised trouble. I turned to Kerry O\u2019Keeffe, a leg-spinner with a sound defensive technique, and implored him to open.\n\n\u201cPlay the innings of your life,\u201d I said. He and Ian Davis grafted for hours, not for glory but for time, shielding our specialists until the demons subsided. Then came the spark: young David Hookes, a 19-year-old debutant with fire in his veins, smashed Greig for five consecutive boundaries, signalling the pitch\u2019s taming. Doug Walters, Rod Marsh, and astonishingly, McCosker himself, built on that foundation. McCosker, his head swathed in bandages, insisted on batting. It was no captain\u2019s order; he demanded it, partnering Marsh for a crucial 54 runs at number 10. Travis Head was baffled at his dismissal on day two of the Boxing Day Test. Credit: Getty Images Marsh became the first Australian keeper to score a Test century, and we set England 463 to win. They fell 45 runs short, despite Derek Randall\u2019s masterful 174, mirroring the margin of the inaugural Test in 1877. That match lasted the distance, a testament to grit over glamour. O\u2019Keeffe, now a commentator, surely remembers. But do today\u2019s crop? Their shrugs and sighs suggest not. They forget that professionalism is not measured by the zeroes on a pay cheque, but by the passion for the game\u2019s lore, the willingness to battle for team, nation, and honour.\n\nIn an era of T20 fireworks and instant gratification, these players risk unravelling 148 years of Ashes tapestry. They inherit a legacy of sacrifice, yet treat it as disposable. Without reverence for the past, how can they inspire the future? Consider another epic from the MCG\u2019s vaults: the 1936-37 Ashes Test, a clash that unfolded in an age when pitches lay exposed to the heavens. Australia trailed 0-2 in the series. Don Bradman at the MCG in 1937. Credit: Fairfax Media A biblical downpour transformed the wicket into a \u2018sticky dog\u2019 \u2013 uneven, drying under the sun, causing the ball to jump, skid, and deviate at unholy angles. Don Bradman captained with cunning. Declaring at 9-200, he forced England to bat on the quagmire. Gubby Allen, England\u2019s skipper, sniffed the ploy and declared at 9-76, thrusting Australia back in while the pitch remained a minefield.\n\nBradman, undeterred, inverted his batting order, sacrificing tailenders to preserve his aces for better times. After a rest day allowed some drying time, Australia amassed 547 in their second innings, Bradman stroking a majestic 270 from number 7. England crumbled, Australia won, and stormed back to claim the series 3-2. That Test went the distance, too, a symphony of strategy and endurance. Contrast this with the 2025 Boxing Day debacle. Two Tests in the series have failed to reach day three, not due to superior skill but a glaring absence of desire. Batters slashed wildly, abandoning technique for bravado, as if \u2018playing their natural game\u2019 excused capitulation. They let down predecessors who bled for this rivalry; they shortchanged fans who braved the holiday heat; they betrayed their own generation by forsaking cricket\u2019s core tenets \u2013 playing each ball on merit, scrapping for every run, enduring bruises for the greater good. I cannot believe any player left the field thinking they had given their all.\n\nI get that white-ball cricket has changed the game and power is valued more in the marketplace today than the ability to absorb pressure, but if the modern player does value Test cricket, as they say, then they must show it by being able to bat collectively for a minimum of 100 overs in any conditions. If they can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, do that, then the format is doomed. Spare a thought for Page, the head groundsman, and his team under MCC boss Stuart Fox. They toiled to craft a competitive surface, thwarted perhaps by unseasonal weather in preparation. Yet the players are just as culpable. MCG curator Matt Page looks on during an Australia nets session on December 24. Credit: Getty Images They hurled Page under the bus, blaming the pitch rather than their own frailties. Few put their body on the line, gesturing, laughing and cursing as they departed as if the surface was unplayable. Appalling. This is Test cricket, not a casual net. Get over yourselves and honour the format that has elevated you. Fight for your comrades, your colours. Absorb blows to extend the contest, ensuring spectators witness the drama they crave.",

        "text": "Brigitte Bardot, the French 1960s film star who became one of the greatest screen sirens of the 20th century and later a militant animal rights activist and far-right supporter, has died. She was 91.\n\n\n\n\n\nBardot died on Sunday local time at her home in southern France, according to Bruno Jacquelin, of the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the protection of animals.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to The Associated Press, he gave no cause of death and said no arrangements had been made for funeral or memorial services. She had been hospitalised last month.\n\n\n\n\n\nBardot became an international celebrity as a teen bride in the 1956 movie And God Created Woman. Directed by then husband Roger Vadim, it triggered a scandal with scenes of the long-legged beauty dancing on tables naked.\n\n\n\nBardot's cinema career spanned more than two dozen films. Source: Getty / Franco Origlia At the height of a cinema career that spanned more than two dozen films and three marriages, Bardot came to symbolise a nation bursting out of bourgeois respectability. Her tousled, blonde hair and voluptuous figure made her one of France's best-known stars, even as she struggled with depression.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuch was her widespread appeal that, in 1969, her features were chosen as the model for Marianne, France's national emblem and the official Gallic seal. Bardot's face appeared on statues, postage stamps and coins.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said in an X post: ''We are mourning a legend.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBardot's second career as an animal rights activist was equally sensational. She travelled to the Arctic to blow the whistle on the slaughter of baby seals. She also condemned the use of animals in laboratory experiments, and she opposed Muslim slaughter rituals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Man is an insatiable predator,\" Bardot told The Associated Press on her 73rd birthday in 2007.\n\n\n\nWhile Bardot was a popular star, her physical appearance was often appreciated more than her talent. Source: AP / Jean Jacques Levy \"I don't care about my past glory. That means nothing in the face of an animal that suffers, since it has no power, no words to defend itself,\" Bardot said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer activism earned her the respect of her compatriots, and in 1985, she was awarded the Legion of Honour, the nation's highest honour.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater, however, she fell from public grace as her animal protection diatribes took on a decidedly extremist tone. She frequently decried the influx of immigrants into France, especially Muslims.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was convicted and fined five times in French courts for inciting racial hatred.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2018, at the height of the #MeToo movement, Bardot said in an interview most actors protesting sexual harassment in the film industry were \"hypocritical\" because many played \"the teases\" with producers to land parts.\n\n\n\nBardot said she had never had been a victim of sexual harassment and found it \"charming to be told that I was beautiful or that I had a nice little ass\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong Bardot's films were A Parisian (1957); In Case of Misfortune, in which she starred in 1958 with screen legend Jean Gabin; The Truth (1960); Private Life (1962); A Ravishing Idiot (1964); Shalako (1968); Women (1969); The Bear And The Doll (1970); Rum Boulevard (1971); and Don Juan (1973).\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while she was a popular star, her physical appearance was often appreciated more than her talent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's an embarrassment to have acted so badly,\" Bardot said of her early films.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the exception of 1963's critically acclaimed Contempt, Bardot's films were rarely complicated by plots. Often, they were vehicles to display Bardot in scanty dresses or frolicking nude in the sun.\n\n\n\n\"It was never a great passion of mine,\" Bardot said of filmmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And it can be deadly sometimes. Marilyn [Monroe] perished because of it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBardot retired to her Riviera villa in St Tropez at the age of 39 in 1973 after The Woman Grabber.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs fans brought flowers to her home, the local St Tropez administration called for \"respect for the privacy of her family and the serenity of the places where she lived\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by Associated Press via Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The holiday season can bring extra cash \u2014 whether it's an year-end bonus, unused leave payout, or a festive cash gift.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while it can be tempting to splurge, experts say this is the perfect time to make your money work for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom investing in stocks and boosting your superannuation to paying down your mortgage, there are several ways to put spare earnings to good use \u2014 just be sure to read the fine print, do your research, and seek professional advice if required.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News spoke with two finance experts to weigh up the pros and cons of each approach, helping you make the most of any spare cash this holiday season.\n\n\n\nIs stock investing a smart move?\n\nMardy Chiah, associate professor of finance at the University of Newcastle, said before building wealth, it can be a good idea to first pay off high-interest debt, as the interest on that debt could outweigh the benefits of investing elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe recommended thinking about your priority, whether that is retirement, wealth building, paying off debt or a mortgage.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are unsure where to start, he said it's important to diversify your investments as a beginner.\n\n\n\n\"Decide whether you want to pick individual stocks or invest in a fund for easier diversification,\" Chiah told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For example, you can buy BHP shares directly on the ASX or invest in an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that includes BHP and other companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Only invest the amount that you are prepared to lose and don't need in the short term, as markets are volatile in the short run.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRakesh Gupta, an associate professor in accounting and finance at Charles Darwin University, said it's wise not to rush into any spending decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Markets swing in days. Wealth builds in years. Patience and diversification win,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The stock market can move very quickly. This year alone, we have seen days when the ASX200 has shifted 2 or 3 per cent in a single session because of overnight policy surprises or global news.\"\n\n\n\nWhat about superannuation?\n\nGupta said contributing extra to your superannuation can have long-term financial gains and remains one of the most tax-effective ways to build wealth over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Extra contributions into a super work particularly well for people with many years until retirement,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The tax benefits are substantial, and consistent contributions build significant wealth over time.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Calls for superannuation protections as some retirees could lose up to $205,000\n\nChiah said there are positives and negatives to this approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Super is a type of managed fund that offers diversification and tax advantages. Contributions and earnings are taxed at 15 per cent, usually lower than personal income tax rates,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Downside: funds are locked until retirement.\"\n\n\n\nPaying down your mortgage\n\nChiah said both superannuation contributions and mortgage repayments are generally solid options for those who prefer a cautious approach to investing, as they typically don't require extensive research or active trading.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to mortgage repayments, he said, if your mortgage interest rate is 5 per cent, you will need to earn at least a 5 per cent after-tax return elsewhere to come out ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nGupta said putting cash towards your mortgage repayments can be a better option than superannuation contributions, because \"the return is guaranteed through interest saved\".\n\n\n\n\"It reduces financial stress, lowers required living costs in retirement and gives people a sense of security that is difficult to quantify but very real in practice,\" Gupta said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Extra super grows wealth. Extra mortgage payments grow certainty. Blending both works for many people.\"\n\n\n\nOther forms of investing\n\nChiah also flagged other forms of investing, typically lower in risk compared to the stock market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Term deposits: Low risk and low return, but often below inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Bonds: Lower risk than stocks, provide steady income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Managed funds/ETFs: Quick diversification without picking individual stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Real estate: Steady income via rental, but less liquidity. Also requires a large initial outlay, often 20 per cent deposit plus stamp duty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Alternative investments: Private equity, commodities like gold, and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. These can offer further diversification but are complex and carry unique risks.\n\n\n\nExtra super grows wealth. Extra mortgage payments grow certainty. Rakesh Gupta, Charles Darwin University\n\nWhether or not you choose to invest, spend or save, Gupta said having financial buffers where possible is a good idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Investing without an emergency fund or while carrying high-cost debt tends to backfire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And circumstances change over time, so reviewing your plan each year is important.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information in this article is general in nature and is not intended as financial advice.

        "text": "Australia's destructive ex-tropical cyclone Alfred has been ranked among the world's most costly disasters fuelled by climate change in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic losses caused by the fierce storm that ravaged southeast Queensland and northern NSW clocked in at roughly $1.8 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 10 most economically catastrophic events listed by UK-based humanitarian relief charity Christian Aid totalled more than $180 billion in losses, with each costing more than $1.5 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe costliest extreme event influenced by human-driven climate change was the Palisade and Eaton wildfires that ripped through suburban Los Angeles in January .\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomic losses from destroyed properties and other damage caused by the catastrophic blaze surpassed $89 billion.\n\n\n\nOther expensive disasters include cyclones in November that triggered destructive flooding and landslides in Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Malaysia .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tropical storms and extreme monsoon system was thought to cost around $37.2 billion, making it the second most expensive event of 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe flooding disaster also claimed more than 1,750 lives, making it among the year's deadliest climate events.\n\n\n\nExtreme rainfall and flooding in China in June and August was the third most costly event.\n\n\n\n\n\nCataloguing extreme weather events is an annual undertaking for the charity seeking to underline the economic and human toll of a changing climate.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt draws on economic loss calculations made by insurance giant Aon, with most estimates based on insured losses and missing the full costs of lost income, environmental degradation and human displacement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe growing body of research linking rising greenhouse gas emissions to specific weather events also informed the report.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Cloud seeding and chemtrails: Debunking the wild theories circling Cyclone Alfred\n\nFollowing ex-tropical cyclone Alfred, which was the eighth most costly disaster listed, ClimaMeter's Rapid Attribution Study found the storm dumped more rain than it would have without human-driven climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe storm, which threatened to barrel through densely-populated urban centres as a category four tropical cyclone before it was downgraded ahead of landfall, owed much of its intensity and rainfall extremes to above-average ocean temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers also noted Alfred tracked further south than was normal, sparking concerns warmer ocean temperatures would allow windstorms to veer into new territory and through settlements unprepared for them.\n\n\n\nScientists broadly expect fewer cyclones under a warming climate but the ones that do form are more likely to be more intense.\n\n\n\n\n\nDavide Faranda, research director at the Laboratoire de Science du Climat et de l'Environnement, said the documented events were not isolated disasters or natural.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are the predictable outcome of a warmer atmosphere and hotter oceans, driven by decades of fossil fuel emissions,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWealthy countries tend to place higher on the disaster cost ranking as they typically have higher property prices and residents are better able to afford insurance.\n\n\n\nYet the economies of poorer nations are usually hit harder by climate change extremes as these countries have fewer resources to respond.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian Aid chief executive officer Patrick Watt said the findings underlined the urgent need for adaptation, particularly in the Global South where resources are stretched.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The poorest communities are first and worst affected,\" he said.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nMeeting a three-time premiership winning rugby league player to look at birds on the outskirts of Western Sydney wasn't on my 2025 bucket list, but 27-year-old Penrith Panther's hooker, Mitch Kenny has agreed to show me his new hobby.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI like getting outside anyway and going on walks and stuff like that, so it's probably just an addition to that. I think it started out as a joke, but you can't joke birdwatching. You're either going out and looking for birds or you're not.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we walk down the track, which I'm told is a local favorite for the diversity of habitats, you can see in such a short space, he stops frequently to point out the birds we're seeing,\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey were just a couple doves. I think they barred shoulder doves, just like pigeon looking birds, which we don't hate, but some we just don't care about that much. What is that? It might be blackface cuckoo shikes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHow did you get into bird watching?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cMainly through my brother. He's always been super keen on wildlife and he's always done this sort of stuff since I moved out here and he lives just up the mountains, started going out in these little expeditions and then tried to steal his hobby and make it a bit of my own and bought myself a pair of binoculars this year and started trying to get into this. And yeah, still just learning.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was in the Blue Mountains that he saw what's known as a spark bird - the term for a bird that gets someone seriously into bird watching after they see it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI always used to go to this one lookout in the lower mountains anyway, but there was signage there that said lookout for the peregrine falcon, the world's fastest bird. It's a raptor. So it was pretty cool and I started going and taking my binoculars every time and it probably took me six or seven times before I finally saw it, and that was my first time feeling the rush of getting a good get.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's one of a growing number of young people getting into birdwatching. After operating for five years, the inner west based birdwatching group, Sydney Bird Clubs, saw one of its biggest ever turnouts In February, 2020,\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cJust before COVID, it felt to us like we were on the cusp of a birdwatching boom. So there was a curiosity among people, and then I think during the pandemic it turned into a hardcore passion for a lot of people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s co-founder Stephanie Chambers, who says the club was set up to break the barriers to getting into birdwatching. The club's seen an influx of younger members in recent years. Environmentalist and host of Death by Birding podcast, Dr Cesar Puechmarin says the pandemic was a catalyst for many new birders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think birds have been thrown into our orbit, especially post COVID. So during COVID, a lot of people were stuck indoors. A lot of people were unable to explore, to go outside, and people started noticing the birds in their local environment, their own backyard. You have a generation of people who grew up playing video games or playing games like Pokemon, and this hobby of birdwatching fits perfectly, right. It's a never ending hobby. You can't finish it, you can't complete it. It's not like a video game that you can complete and then that's it. There will always be more birds.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Chambers says birdwatching allows people to tap into something that's almost an antidote to the internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI view it as a form of resistance against technology and social media. With our modern world, with the internet and social media, we're losing something and when you bird watch, you're not only just watching birds, you're watching seasonal changes, you're observing migrations. And so I think it tunes you into something that you would be without if you didn't. So I think it strikes at the core of who we are as humans.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that act of resistance against social media is now popping up online. Senior public relations manager at Bird Life Australia, Sean Dooley says the new generation of birders are turning to social media\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnd we were certainly worried in the digital age that people were just on their screens and not out in nature. But the sort of, I dunno what you call it, like the nature TikTok or the naturegram bird Instagram has really taken over because birds are so beautiful to look at and you can actually have an adventure seeing them, that it has attracted a whole tribe of digital natives to it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat online community has moved into the real world for Mitch Kenny, who's been out on a number of bird dates since he started posting about birds online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou meet someone, you talk a bit of shit, go for a walk and hopefully see a few birds. It is pretty fun. I think I'm pretty keen to go out with someone who knows what they're looking for. And then some people are pretty keen to meet a footy player and stuff like that, so there's a mutual exchange there. So everyone wins.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Dooley says that transfer of knowledge is important.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen you move into the wild, there is a risk that you were disturbing the natural life cycle of birds. But I think when the community find each other, they do start to, that type of advice is like, Hey dude, you shouldn't really be going up to that nest because that eagle will abandon the chicks if you come too close. That sort of information starts to get shared.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says, when people get more interested in birds, it has flow on effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHopefully that in a lot of people's birdwatching journey, they come to the realization that to continue the passion that they love because of the variety we have in Australia, we want to keep that variety and that people are going to have to do something about it to save the things that bring them joy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething Mitch Kenny says he's already experiencing.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Summer may bring more rental listings, but with demand still overwhelming supply, experts say soaring prices are cementing housing affordability as one of Australia's biggest economic flashpoints heading into 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nRents for houses remain at record highs across the country, with unit prices not far behind, as Australia enters the peak lease-changeover period.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe summer months have long delivered the biggest surge in rental listings, but this year's activity has been intensified by the return of international students, new migrant workers, and local renters searching for more affordable options.\n\n\n\n\n\nNicola Powell, chief of research and economics at Domain, told SBS News summer consistently marks the busiest period for new leases and renewals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You tend to find that vacancies start to rise towards the end of the year as those listings come onto the rental market,\" she said.\n\n\n\nPowell said this follows a big changeover period early in the new year, when vacancy rates are expected to dip again once that wave of activity passes.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said this pattern reflects the calendar for universities and graduate hiring, as well as landlords' preference to advertise during the holiday period when they have more time to organise maintenance and inspections.\n\n\n\nStill a 'landlord's market'\n\nEven with the seasonal boost in listings, renters are unlikely to feel real relief, according to Powell.\n\n\n\n\n\nVacancy rates across the country remain below 2 per cent \u2014 an exceptionally tight level that continues to favour a \"landlord's market\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The rental market is still competitive,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tenants are going to find there is more choice, but more tenants are looking for rentals at this period of time as well.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO INTERVIEW: Eliza Owen from Cotality on the RBA's impact on the property market SBS News 05:48 English\n\nRecord-low vacancies have also helped push both house and unit rents to new heights in most major cities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some of our major capital cities are better than others, but I think we still have high rents. We still have house rents at record highs across all our capitals,\" Powell said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most capital cities have high unit rents as well.\"\n\n\n\nWeekly rents remain high\n\nData from Domain shows rents for houses and units have steadily increased over the seven years to September 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney remains the most expensive city for units, averaging $750 a week, while Hobart is the cheapest at $490.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor houses, Sydney again tops the list at $780 a week. Hobart and Melbourne share the lowest average house rents at $580.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross the combined capitals, the average weekly rent for houses and units sits at $650.\n\n\n\nSydney remains the most expensive city for units, averaging $750 a week, while Hobart is the cheapest at $490, according to Domain's September 2025 Rental Report. Source: SBS News Powell said the government's new first-home buyers' scheme could reduce pressure on the rental market \u2014 but not immediately.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The scheme could take some element of demand away from the rental market, but whether or not it'll be felt as quickly as this changeover season is to be determined,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Over time, we should see more tenants transitioning to being homeowners. That's the aim of this policy.\"\n\n\n\nSydney has the highest average house rent at $780 per week, while Hobart and Melbourne have the lowest average house rents at $580 per week, according to Domain's September 2025 Rental Report. Source: SBS News\n\nNegotiating your rent in a tight market\n\nDespite strong competition, this moment of higher supply may give tenants a brief window to negotiate \u2014 particularly those with a reliable payment record or long-term tenancy.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeanne Pilkington, president of the Real Estate Institute of Australia, told SBS News both tenants and landlords should familiarise themselves with their rights, review comparable rental prices and start conversations early.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tenants should know their rights and start lease talks early,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Landlords should keep properties in top shape, follow the rules, and give proper notice for rent or lease changes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said landlords can increase rent according to state and territory rules, but they are required to provide proper written notice to tenants and adhere to the required notice periods.\n\n\n\n\n\nTenants, on the other hand, can negotiate before signing a lease renewal or accepting a rent increase.\n\n\n\n\"They can ask for a lower rent, get more information, or suggest terms based on what's fair in the current market or their personal situation,\" Pilkington said.\n\n\n\nSubletting on the rise \u2014 and the risks\n\nWith rising costs prompting some renters to consider subletting for the first time, Pilkington warned failing to follow legal requirements can lead to disputes, fines, or broken leases.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most states and territories, tenants must obtain their landlord's written permission before subletting or adding occupants.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome leases prohibit subletting altogether, while others allow it with specific conditions.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE 'Unacceptable': The question nearly seven in 10 renters fear asking their landlord\n\n\"When putting the agreement in writing, it should clearly address: rent or contribution to utilities, access to shared spaces, length of stay, notice periods, responsibilities for cleaning, guests, noise and property maintenance and what happens if something is damaged or lost,\" Pilkington said.\n\n\n\nWhat does this mean for 2026?\n\nExperts say this year's supercharged summer market suggests affordability pressures will remain acute in 2026, even as new policies aim to gradually shift some renters into homeownership.\n\n\n\n\n\nKaytlin Ezzy, an economist at property analytics group Cotality, said it is \"unlikely\" property prices will fall in the near term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The same factors that have supported value growth over the past few months, including restricted advertised supply, lower borrowing costs and the expansion of the First Home Guarantee scheme, will likely continue to support growth in 2026,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEzzy said government policies around housing are likely to push values higher, unless they are specifically designed to increase supply or reduce demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The expanded first home guarantee schemes, for example, while great at helping some first-time homeowners get into the market, have placed pressure on home values, not only from said first-time buyers but also from speculative investors chasing capital gains in these areas,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile property prices show no sign of falling, renters may experience some relief in the months following summer, when competition for rentals tends to decline, according to Ezzy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"After rising on average around 9 per cent between December and March, the rolling 3-month count of new rental listings typically eases into a quieter winter period, declining on average by 8.5 per cent between March and June.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The surface was damp, verdant, a bowler\u2019s paradise that spat like a cornered cobra.\n\nEngland captain Tony Greig won the toss and inserted Australia, a decision that unleashed carnage. Bob Willis, that lanky spearhead, hurled a bouncer that reared unpredictably from the damp surface, striking McCosker square on the jaw. The crack echoed around the ground; blood sprayed, and in a cruel irony, the ball deflected onto the stumps, dismissing him. His jaw shattered, McCosker was rushed to a hospital, his face a mask of agony. Australia limped to 138, pilloried by the press as inadequate.

We had fought tooth and nail against a strong seam attack of Willis, JK Lever and Chris Old and the best damp wicket bowler of his era, Derek Underwood, on a demon of a track. If we bowled with fire, England would falter too. Thanks to Dennis Lillee and Max Walker, they did, handing us a precious 43-run first-innings lead. The pitch was improving, but in the early hours of our second innings, it still promised trouble. I turned to Kerry O\u2019Keeffe, a leg-spinner with a sound defensive technique, and implored him to open.\n\n\u201cPlay the innings of your life,\u201d I said. He and Ian Davis grafted for hours, not for glory but for time, shielding our specialists until the demons subsided. Then came the spark: young David Hookes, a 19-year-old debutant with fire in his veins, smashed Greig for five consecutive boundaries, signalling the pitch\u2019s taming. Doug Walters, Rod Marsh, and astonishingly, McCosker himself, built on that foundation. McCosker, his head swathed in bandages, insisted on batting. It was no captain\u2019s order; he demanded it, partnering Marsh for a crucial 54 runs at number 10. Travis Head was baffled at his dismissal on day two of the Boxing Day Test. Credit: Getty Images Marsh became the first Australian keeper to score a Test century, and we set England 463 to win. They fell 45 runs short, despite Derek Randall\u2019s masterful 174, mirroring the margin of the inaugural Test in 1877. That match lasted the distance, a testament to grit over glamour. O\u2019Keeffe, now a commentator, surely remembers. But do today\u2019s crop? Their shrugs and sighs suggest not. They forget that professionalism is not measured by the zeroes on a pay cheque, but by the passion for the game\u2019s lore, the willingness to battle for team, nation, and honour.\n\nIn an era of T20 fireworks and instant gratification, these players risk unravelling 148 years of Ashes tapestry. They inherit a legacy of sacrifice, yet treat it as disposable. Without reverence for the past, how can they inspire the future? Consider another epic from the MCG\u2019s vaults: the 1936-37 Ashes Test, a clash that unfolded in an age when pitches lay exposed to the heavens. Australia trailed 0-2 in the series. Don Bradman at the MCG in 1937. Credit: Fairfax Media A biblical downpour transformed the wicket into a \u2018sticky dog\u2019 \u2013 uneven, drying under the sun, causing the ball to jump, skid, and deviate at unholy angles. Don Bradman captained with cunning. Declaring at 9-200, he forced England to bat on the quagmire. Gubby Allen, England\u2019s skipper, sniffed the ploy and declared at 9-76, thrusting Australia back in while the pitch remained a minefield.\n\nBradman, undeterred, inverted his batting order, sacrificing tailenders to preserve his aces for better times. After a rest day allowed some drying time, Australia amassed 547 in their second innings, Bradman stroking a majestic 270 from number 7. England crumbled, Australia won, and stormed back to claim the series 3-2. That Test went the distance, too, a symphony of strategy and endurance. Contrast this with the 2025 Boxing Day debacle. Two Tests in the series have failed to reach day three, not due to superior skill but a glaring absence of desire. Batters slashed wildly, abandoning technique for bravado, as if \u2018playing their natural game\u2019 excused capitulation. They let down predecessors who bled for this rivalry; they shortchanged fans who braved the holiday heat; they betrayed their own generation by forsaking cricket\u2019s core tenets \u2013 playing each ball on merit, scrapping for every run, enduring bruises for the greater good. I cannot believe any player left the field thinking they had given their all.\n\nI get that white-ball cricket has changed the game and power is valued more in the marketplace today than the ability to absorb pressure, but if the modern player does value Test cricket, as they say, then they must show it by being able to bat collectively for a minimum of 100 overs in any conditions. If they can\u2019t, or won\u2019t, do that, then the format is doomed. Spare a thought for Page, the head groundsman, and his team under MCC boss Stuart Fox. They toiled to craft a competitive surface, thwarted perhaps by unseasonal weather in preparation. Yet the players are just as culpable. MCG curator Matt Page looks on during an Australia nets session on December 24. Credit: Getty Images They hurled Page under the bus, blaming the pitch rather than their own frailties. Few put their body on the line, gesturing, laughing and cursing as they departed as if the surface was unplayable. Appalling. This is Test cricket, not a casual net. Get over yourselves and honour the format that has elevated you. Fight for your comrades, your colours. Absorb blows to extend the contest, ensuring spectators witness the drama they crave.",
