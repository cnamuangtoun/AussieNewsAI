We take a look at the ins and outs.\n\nChildren and parents are wondering how video games will be impacted by the upcoming social media ban. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nWill the social media ban affect video games?\n\nYes, some video game platforms will be impacted by the upcoming social media ban.\n\nWhilst specific games themselves will not be impacted, platforms that children can play video games on, or can watch streamers play popular video games on will be part of the ban.\n\nThe key criteria for platforms to fall foul of the new legislation include having \"the sole purpose, or a significant purpose, of the service is to enable online social interaction between two or more end-users,\" according to the website of the eSafety Commissioner.\n\n\"Platforms that have the sole or primary purpose of enabling messaging or online gaming are among a number of types of services that have been excluded under the legislative rules,\" it added.\n\nHowever, some platforms are included and some platforms are excluded.\n\neSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant at a press conference at Parliament House in Canberra on Monday 1 December 2025. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nWhat platforms are affected by the social media ban?\n\nThe main video game platform that falls under the ban is Twitch.\n\nThe site is an online streaming platform where users can broadcast live streams or view pre-recorded videos, and it is popular with streamers who show themselves playing video games.\n\nDiscord, a similar platform, has not been included in the ban as it stands.\n\nSteam and Steam Deck, a platform where users can purchase and play video games on, has also not been included in the ban.\n\nThere has been no news about banning specific consoles or video games, despite both offering the ability to communicate with other users via text or audio chat.\n\nFor example, Playstation and Xbox consoles offer the ability for users to communicate with one another, even if the game they are playing doesn't have the infrastructure to do so.\ufeff\n\nIs Roblox included in the social media ban?\n\nRoblox is another popular video game platform, particularly for children.\n\nThere is no minimum age for the platform, which is a game-creation platform where users can create their own games or play games designed by other users.\n\nA child is seen playing a game on the Roblox platform.

(ABC News: Lydia Burton)\n\n\"When a machine breaks down in the middle of harvest, waiting on an authorised dealer isn't just inconvenient, it can cost tens of thousands of dollars,\" Mr McIntyre said.\n\n\"Farmers will finally have more freedom to choose who services and repairs their machinery.\n\n\"That means less downtime, lower costs, and more control over their own businesses.\"\n\nGrainGrowers advocacy and rural affairs manager Sean Cole said the commitment was \"a landmark win for the industry\" after years of being \"left out of the tent\".\n\nHe said he had heard of new equipment being \"laid to waste for a couple of weeks\" during peak periods, forcing farmers to resurrect decades-old machinery to beat incoming rain.\n\n\"Grain harvesters or tractors are computers on wheels,\" he said.\n\n\"They're not much more complicated than light vehicles, we'd argue, but they have digital locks and things that can lock people out.\"\n\nChange comes as no surprise\n\nManufacturers and dealers said they were ready for the shift.\n\n\"We've been expecting it for some time \u2026 it's been no surprise to us,\" Tractor and Machinery Association of Australia (TMA) executive director Gary Northover said.\n\nGary Northover says the association supports the right to repair, but not \"modification\". (Supplied: TMA)\n\nHe said TMA members supported a farmer's right to repair and to use third-party technicians, with many already expanding access to diagnostic tools and manuals.\n\nHowever, Mr Northover said the industry distinguished repair from modification.\n\n\"What we don't support is \u2026 the unfettered right to modify machines,\" he said.\n\n\" This just doesn't mean that there's a free for all. \"\n\nWhile some dealers may worry about losing service revenue, Mr Northover said many already relied on third-party repairers as major customers and acknowledged there were not enough technicians to meet demand.\n\nHe said manufacturers and dealers were \"broadly aligned\" with farmers and keen to help craft a \"fair and equitable outcome\" when consultations begin next year.",

The immediate future of Tigers CEO Shane Richardson, who has been closely allied to O\u2019Farrell, has also come into question, with former chairman Lee Hagipantelis predicting he won\u2019t survive into the next NRL season. \u2018My concern [is] that this will disrupt Wests Tigers so fundamentally that it will put them back for another decade.\u2019 Barnier-Crawford report co-author Gary Barnier Following a statement by the four deposed directors, former NSW premier O\u2019Farrell told ABC Sydney Mornings with Hamish McDonald that he was baffled by HBG\u2019s latest move, and forecast potential NRL intervention at the embattled club. \u201cFor reasons I suspect relate to antics within the Holman Barnes Group and the desire for people to get to the top there, we\u2019ve had yet another brain fart affecting the club,\u201d O\u2019Farrell said.\n\n\u201cA year ago, they replaced their chair (Julia Romero) after the best returns Holman Barnes had ever received. And here we are a year later, they\u2019re replacing the board of West Tigers at a time when, on all the indices for the first time in many years, we\u2019ve done well. \u201cWe\u2019ve achieved our first profit, I think, in more than a decade. And at that moment, the owners, as they\u2019re able to, have decided to take this action.\u201d Wests Tigers during one of their on-field highlights from 2025. Credit: Getty Images O\u2019Farrell, who first joined the Tigers as interim chairman in December 2023, foreshadowed the NRL stepping in to sort out the club\u2019s governance issues. The game\u2019s governing body made governance restructuring, including the appointment of independent directors and key performance targets, a condition of loan commitments to the Tigers in 2013. \u201cIf it continues to go to hell in a hand basket, I have no doubt that the NRL will do what the NRL would always do, which is seek to protect the image of rugby league,\u201d O\u2019Farrell said.\n\nInner West Council mayor Darcy Byrne, who was pivotal in securing state and federal funding for Leichhardt Oval upgrades, called for Liquor and Gaming NSW to \u201cinvestigate and intervene\u201d in the club\u2019s administrative issues. Pointing to the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority\u2019s previous investigation of disharmony and board directors being dismissed, Byrne said that \u201cif this doesn\u2019t demonstrate that there is a problem with governance in that organisation, then nothing will.\u201d Former Wests Tigers chairman Lee Hagipantelis. Credit: Getty Richardson\u2019s role at the club is the next key question, with O\u2019Farrell\u2019s predecessor Hagipantelis predicting he won\u2019t survive into next season. Richardson is one of the most experienced administrators in the game, but could become collateral damage in the latest power play at the Tigers.\n\nRichardson hasn\u2019t yet commented publicly on the situation, but former Tigers chair Hagipantelis predicts he could soon be the next to go. Asked if he felt Richardson wouldn\u2019t be in his position for the start of next season, Hagipantelis told SEN radio: \u201cI agree \u2026 Richardson had, not an unfettered discretion, but a very wide discretion reporting to Barry, as opposed to all the board for a lot of the decision-making that had to be made in relation to the running of an NRL club. \u201cThat level of delegated authority, it\u2019s very hard to bring back, to restrain or to constrain. There will be some issues of concern there, and Richardson will have to think as to whether he can operate now as to how he did previously with the new board.\u201d It has been speculated that Richardson had negotiated clauses in his contract that would result in a payout if there were changes at board level. \u201cI think that would be very much likely,\u201d Hagipantelis said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard those suggestions as well, that the contract was created in such a fashion where his position was solidified in writing and with delegated authority also.",

        "text": "Crypto assets provide a leveraged exposure to \u201crisk-on\u201d or \u201crisk-off\u201d environments. At the moment it is definitely a risk-off environment. That\u2019s why the administration\u2019s desire to make the US the centre of the crypto universe and bring it into the mainstream of US finance is open to debate. It has made the Trump family, and some of Trump\u2019s cabinet members, far wealthier, but are there risks associated with their ambition? Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s comments sparked the latest crypto plunge. Credit: Bloomberg The Genius Act provided a legislative framework for stablecoins \u2013 digital tokens, normally with a price fixed at $US1, that are backed with stable and liquid assets that enable them to maintain their value. The Act requires stablecoin promoters issuing their tokens in the US to back them with reserves of cash, short-term Treasury securities or other safe assets. They will have to publish audited financial statements and will be regulated by the US, unless they are regulated by a country with similar rules.\n\nLast week the group behind the biggest stablecoin, USDT, was downgraded by S&P Global Ratings, which assessed Tether\u2019s assets as \u201cconstrained\u201d and cited an increased in high-risk assets. Within the backing for USDT\u2019s $US184.4 billion tokens in circulation are US Treasuries, gold and other commodities, Bitcoin, corporate loans and cash. Loading S&P said Tether provided limited transparency on its reserves and its risk appetite. There was a lack of a robust regulatory framework and no asset segregation. Tether pointed to its track record \u2013 apart from a moment in 2022 when USDT\u2019s price sank as low as US95\u00a2 during a panic within the crypto market it has generally maintained its peg with the US dollar \u2013 and said it led the industry in transparent reporting. It also said it had total assets of $US215 billion and liabilities of $US184 billion, leaving surplus reserves of about $US30 billion it could call on if necessary. Tether doesn\u2019t meet the criteria set by the Genius Act, so will probably need to establish a new US-compliant vehicle if it wants to continue issuing tokens to US investors. Originally headquartered in the British Virgin Islands, this year it moved to crypto-friendly El Salvador.\n\nWhile it is conceivable that the Trump administration might declare that El Salvador\u2019s regulations are sufficient \u2013 Trump has a good relationship with its president, Nayib Bukele, who has controversially accepted, and imprisoned, some of the administration\u2019s deported immigrants \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be a good look, even for Trump, to allow an entity that the Biden administration accused of money-laundering, sanctions busting and assisting terrorist groups and arms dealers into the regulated centre of US finance. Tether\u2019s current asset base would also disqualify it from compliance with the Genius Act\u2019s requirements. The Genius Act is expected to dramatically increase the size of the stablecoin market, from several hundred billion dollars to several trillion dollars. Because of the asset requirements \u2013 short-term Treasuries, cash and similar high-quality assets \u2013 stablecoins could end up being major investors in US government debt. A new, essentially forced, source of buying would help moderate US bond yields at the shorter end of the yield curve and help lower the cost of US government debt. US debt issuance has increasingly targeted short-dated (and lower interest cost) bonds in recent years.\n\nAs the second half of this year has shown, however, crypto markets are inherently volatile and, while they might be stable in most circumstances, as a crypto asset class, stablecoins aren\u2019t entirely immune from contagion. The steady flows of buying of Treasuries to match inflows of investors funds into their stablecoins could reverse and turn into torrents of forced selling in a general crypto panic. The behaviour of the crypto market over the past couple of months underscores how, even with continuing infusion of institutional investors in response to the crypto-friendly (and crypto active) Trump administration, volatile it is. There\u2019s a more leveraged relationship with yields in forced sales than there is in normal buying \u2013 if Treasuries were being dumped, the yields would spike significantly. Whatever the benefits from a new sourced of buying, they would be dwarfed by the consequences of forced selling. The administration might think they\u2019ve found a clever way to help suppress US bond yields and reduce its interest costs, but a crisis in the crypto market could spill over into volatility and instability in the most important financial market in the US, indeed in the globe. If there were a more general financial crisis, turmoil in the crypto market would amplify its effects on the epicentre of the financial system.",

The American chief executive of Woodside Energy is bringing the Australian oil and gas giant back to her old home. Its $US17.5 billion ($26.71 billion) Louisiana LNG project, just off the Gulf of America/Mexico, is the company\u2019s biggest US investment, and the largest foreign direct investment in Louisiana\u2019s history. The gas yield is potentially massive: 27 million tonnes a year. That\u2019s basically equivalent to Woodside\u2019s combined Australian operations. Trump\u2019s energy and interior secretaries have praised the project for helping unleash \u201cAmerican energy dominance\u201d. Speaker Mike Johnson appeared virtually at the groundbreaking. Woodside bought the Driftwood LNG project, as it was then known, last year under Joe Biden, but made a final investment decision in April. If the US is \u201copen for business\u201d, as the president likes to say, Woodside is shaping up as a great customer. \u201cI had a \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 approach to who I was at work,\u201c: Woodside chief executive Meg O\u2019Neill came out when she moved to Australia. Credit: Photo: Ben Sklar We are bending the rules of this column: O\u2019Neill and I are meeting for brunch, and the restaurant, Ai Fiori, has no real significance other than its convenient location at the Langham Hotel, where she is staying in New York. We get our orders in quickly: I indulge my Australian sensibilities with avocado toast and a cortado (effectively a piccolo), while O\u2019Neill goes for a salmon bagel and black coffee. Despite seven years in Australia, O\u2019Neill is yet to embrace espresso culture. \u201cI like American-style filtered coffee,\u201d she says. \u201cI brew coffee at home every morning and bring in a thermos.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nO\u2019Neill grew up in the college town of Boulder, Colorado, studied at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and joined ExxonMobil. The job took her around the world, including Indonesia, where she split her time between Jakarta and the gas fields of Aceh \u2013 and she was there for the devastating 2004 tsunami that killed at least 225,000 people. She has also lived in Texas, Norway and the remote Canadian city St John\u2019s on Newfoundland island. The bill for lunch at Ai Fiori in New York. In 2018, O\u2019Neill joined Woodside as chief operating officer and moved to Perth, becoming its CEO in 2021. She spent most of her career in the closet \u2013 \u201cI had a \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 approach to who I was at work,\u201d she says \u2013 but moving to Australia was the opportunity to come out. She is one of a handful of openly gay people to have led an ASX200 company. This is O\u2019Neill\u2019s seventh trip back to the US this year. You can see why she might be more comfortable on this side of the Pacific right now. Here, the motto is \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d, but in Australia, Woodside faces growing scrutiny of its climate and environmental impact.

The UN\u2019s special rapporteur on climate has just joined the case as an amicus curiae. Loading\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt doesn\u2019t rattle O\u2019Neill. She believes the discourse is changing: not just because of the new administration in Washington, but a growing realisation that powering the artificial intelligence era and its energy-hungry data centres will require massive supplies of reliable energy, including from fossil fuels. She says Trump\u2019s pro-energy, anti-climate dogma is having an impact outside the US, including in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging some views that have been probably accepted without a lot of question or debate for a few years,\u201d O\u2019Neill says. O\u2019Neill at Woodside\u2019s Karratha gas plant. \u201cIt\u2019s opening the conversation up to one that\u2019s not just, \u2018We have to solve climate change and forget about everything else\u2019, to one that says: actually, we have to solve a number of different problems, and the solution may not be perfect for any one of those dimensions.\u201d O\u2019Neill notes that some European nations are increasingly conscious of losing their manufacturing edge due to the high price of energy compared with the US and China. Indeed, a day after our lunch, Germany confirms plans to subsidise energy prices for heavy industry to bolster its stagnating economy. In Australia, the Albanese government wants to reduce emissions by 62 to 70 per cent by 2035, a target O\u2019Neill calls \u201chighly ambitious\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know that the ramifications for society have been fully thought through, or described to the Australian people,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nO\u2019Neill and Resources Minister Madeleine King at last year\u2019s Midwinter Ball in Canberra. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen How would she describe it, then? The lower-hanging fruit is gone, so deeper emissions cuts mean large-scale changes to electricity generation, and dumping coal. \u201cWhile there are visions of how we might get there, the permitting is not keeping up, the environmental approvals are not keeping up with that,\u201d she says. \u201cThe question of how you maintain reliable power with a heavy renewable input \u2013 that has not been addressed. How do you decarbonise heavy industry \u2013 has not been addressed. You\u2019re seeing examples of industry flagging that increases in power prices are causing them to rethink the value of their investments. That\u2019s going to be a choice between: do we keep jobs or do we cut emissions? So, Australia [will] have to start to confront some of these questions that Europe is confronting today.\u201d O\u2019Neill\u2019s salmon bagel arrives deconstructed; she declares it \u201cvery tasty\u201d. My avocado toast is fine, but could do with some feta (high standards!). The coffee is mid. For fossil fuel producers like Woodside, the times are arguably bending in their favour. The political heat has come out of climate change in developed countries, usurped by cost-of-living concerns. While most voters still say climate change is a major threat, the percentage has fallen from its 2018-22 era highs, the Pew Research Centre has found \u2013 from Europe to Canada to South Korea and Australia.

What climate responsibility, if any, does Woodside think it has in this new world? O\u2019Neill adheres strictly to the disputed mantra that gas is a transition fuel that can replace coal rather than displace renewables. She suggests critics of gas are doing the coal lobby\u2019s bidding. \u201cIn Australia, there\u2019s been probably close to 20 years of this anti-gas sentiment, which has at the end of the day resulted in brown coal staying in the mix longer,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s people who are true environmentalists who are driving the anti-gas movement, or if it\u2019s people who are in the coal industry, but the outcome is poor for the environment and it\u2019s going to end up being poor for the consumers.\u201d She points to taxpayer subsidies to keep coal plants open. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for anyone.\u201d Protesters at Woodside\u2019s annual meeting in Perth last year. Credit: Bloomberg But the hugely controversial North West Shelf extension in Western Australia is expected to be responsible for nearly 90 million tonnes of CO\u2082 equivalent a year \u2013 more than the annual emissions of some countries \u2013 despite conditions imposed by the federal government as part of its approval. Moreover, the extension is only justified if Woodside and its partners ultimately get access to the Browse basin near the pristine Scott Reef, considered the country\u2019s largest untapped conventional gas resource. Those approvals are ongoing. Still, the Australian government and companies like Woodside are increasingly singing from the same song sheet on environmental laws, complaining that it takes too long to assess major projects. Woodside was ropeable that it took six years for the West Australian government to approve the NWS extension, before the baton was passed to the federal government for a separate assessment.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size One of the first things that catches the eye when you drive into Club Marconi in Bossley Park is a large metal soccer ball on stilts. Like the team that plays here, it has a storied history. Constructed for the 1993 FIFA World Youth Championship held in Australia, the ball was rolled onto the field at the old Sydney Football Stadium as part of the tournament\u2019s opening ceremony, then placed on its stand and lit up by surrounding pyrotechnics. After the tournament, nobody knew what to do with it \u2013 except the then-Marconi president Tony Labbozzetta, who saw an historic ornament befitting his club, the champions of the National Soccer League that season. He organised for the giant ball to be erected over the turnstiles at Marconi Stadium, where all spectators pass through on the way to their seats. Over time, its lustre faded, its painted exterior giving way to rust and grime. In the opening scene of the book The Death and Life of Australian Soccer, author Joe Gorman sketches a picture of institutional decline on the day in 2015 that Marconi were relegated to the ignominy of NSW\u2019s second division, a depth they hadn\u2019t plumbed in almost half a century. Gorman describes the ball as a \u201crelic of a bygone era, similar to one of those dusty old silos in a long-forgotten rural town.\u201d It\u2019s looking much better these days. \u201cIt was due for a nice paint job,\u201d admits Robert Carniato, Marconi\u2019s football chairman. In preparation for the new Australian Championship, and Marconi\u2019s return to national competition for the first time in 21 years, it was given a much-needed facelift \u2013 and it is standing proudly again above the gates, symbolic now of possibility, not decay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven the jersey Marconi wore for their semi-final against Brisbane side Moreton City Excelsior was a throwback: a modern adaptation of the club\u2019s 1993 kit, the sort of garish design that is very much in vogue again. Club Marconi itself, a true Sydney sporting institution, has also been recently renovated; you can see why they call this place \u201cthe Palace\u201d. But traces of the recent past remain, like a sign instructing patrons that the only national flag allowed to be flown in the venue is the Australian one. That rule is outdated. In 2019, Football Australia lifted the ban on national flags, and on Saturday afternoon, the Italian tricolour was everywhere. Marconi\u2019s jersey for the inaugural Australian Championship is a throwback to 1993. Credit: Damian Briggs/Football Australia The searing 35-degree heat and accompanying hairdryer-like wind would have kept some people away, but there were plenty streaming into the stadium, underneath the ball \u2013 at least four times the number they\u2019d usually see for a regular NPL fixture, club officials say. Carniato\u2019s late father and grandfather were founding members of the club, back in the days when pretty much everyone who came here was a newly arrived Italian migrant. As the diaspora assimilated into Australian society, that fan base dwindled. \u201cOur supporters are basically elderly \u2013 or mums and dads because, obviously, we get a lot of our kids to come and watch the game,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019re starting to get a lot more young people interested.\u201d For example: Cameron Lowe, 20, who is part of The Stables, the self-appointed Marconi active supporter group. When this masthead met them pre-match, they consisted of precisely six blokes: five in Marconi jerseys and one in a Parramatta Eels top, most of whom were on the pre-midday beers. Only one of them has an Italian background, which is perhaps illustrative of the new Marconi. They are too young to have experienced the glory days themselves, but old enough to have heard stories about them, and keen to help bring them back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLowe is also a Western Sydney Wanderers fan, but wasn\u2019t planning on going to the A-League\u2019s Sydney derby at CommBank Stadium that night. \u201cAll I care about is this,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more raw, and I prefer it. It\u2019s less media, it\u2019s less all this \u2026 because it is a lot smaller in comparison, it\u2019s a bit more compact, you can hear everything, you feel everything. Marconi\u2019s unofficial active supporter group The Stables. Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong \u201cWe\u2019ve come to all the games here. It\u2019s been generational. I\u2019ve never felt better about football. I\u2019ve never enjoyed Australian football as much as I have now, and I cannot wait for the NPL season to start next year \u2013 or whatever the next step is for the Australian Championship.\u201d Inside the VIP area, where pizza, pasta and Italian meats and cheeses are being served for lunch, Socceroos coach Tony Popovic is watching the game with John Tsatsimas, his former chief executive at Western Sydney Wanderers, and Mark Ivancic, the chairman of Sydney United 58, Popovic\u2019s boyhood club. Anthony Caceres, a Marconi junior who now plays for Macarthur FC and the Socceroos, is sitting a few rows ahead. The room is a snapshot of Australian football\u2019s past and present, converging at a place that helped shape both. FA chairman Anter Isaac is in the house, too, explaining how we got here. Isaac has played a key role in the development of the Australian Championship, a new national second-tier competition involving eight \u201cfoundation\u201d clubs, such as Marconi, and eight other qualifiers from around the country, like Moreton City, the NPL Queensland champions. The Championship is not so much a separate league, which is what the foundation clubs initially wanted, but an end-of-year Champions League-style tournament. The standard of play is somewhere between the NPL and the A-League, though crowds have varied wildly from a few hundred to a few thousand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt matches our expectations,\u201d Isaac says. \u201cWe thought early on people would be excited, enthusiastic, but also maybe hesitant, not quite sure of what this competition\u2019s about. \u201cOne point that I keep trying to make internally is you can\u2019t build a trend line off one data point. You can\u2019t build a trend line off two data points. Three data points, you can start finding things out, whether it\u2019s working or not.\u201d Football Australia chairman Anter Isaac. Credit: Getty Images There will be at least five data points. Despite pre-launch rumours that it would be short-lived, Isaac says FA\u2019s board has decided to support the Championship for five years. It is a loss-making exercise, but the federation sees it as more of an investment in the game, one that is intended to give further opportunities to players, coaches, referees and administrators, and aspirational NPL clubs a suitable environment to increase their operations. Those clubs, that have been calling for a second division almost since the A-League started two decades ago, are now coming to terms with what that requires, and the difficulties of reaching the benchmarks set by FA: not just better football, but better marketing, merchandising, membership, sponsorship and brand awareness. There were some \u201cnerves\u201d among A-League clubs when it launched, Isaac says, but now they\u2019ve seen it for themselves, they realise it is not so much a direct threat but an opportunity, and an incubator they could soon benefit from. By the time the A-League next expands, Isaac hopes clubs such as Marconi, courtesy of their experiences in the Championship, will be in a position to table a serious, legitimate bid to rejoin the full-time professional ranks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably the more reasonable pathway for them in the medium to long term,\u201d Isaac says. The match itself is decent fare, though it suffered a little because of the conditions, forcing drinks breaks to be taken in each half \u2013 but it was a tense, hard-fought contest, won 1-0 by Marconi thanks to Matej Busek\u2019s 80th-minute goal. Marconi Stadium was buzzing on Saturday. Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong The crowd was lively, too, and gave it to Moreton City\u2019s coach when he received a yellow card for dissent. \u201cGo back to Queensland,\u201d he was told by one punter. The crowd was also, to be blunt, small. The official attendance was just 1477, but in a close-knit venue like this, it felt like a lot more than that \u2013 and better than some A-League games feel in bigger, more cavernous stadiums. The Championship averaged attendances of about 1500 during the group stage, with Marconi\u2019s crowds putting them in the upper half of the competition. Still, those aren\u2019t the sort of numbers that will return Marconi to the promised land, and they know it. Growth will take time, effort and money.\n\nAdvertisement",

He is a high-impact player who brings a lethal combination of speed and endurance, and uses his athletic assets to take the game on. Rebuilding Richmond showed a willingness this year to blood young players, so expect the Tigers to find a way to unleash Grlj early next year. Xavier Taylor and Latrelle Pickett join a new-look Melbourne squad. Credit: Justin McManus Xavier Taylor (Melbourne) The Demons\u2019 recruiters were doing cartwheels when Taylor slipped through to them. He developed impressively across the season, culminating in his best-on-ground performance in the Eastern Ranges\u2019 grand final triumph. Taylor is 192 centimetres, which helps him impact the game aerially in defence, where he is an excellent interceptor. He is not afraid to take the game on, but also stands up defensively and has improved his decision-making, which will help him play early, while he is confident enough to back himself. Latrelle Pickett (Melbourne)\n\nLoading Kysaiah Pickett\u2019s cousin has joined him at the Demons, and his arrival could lead to more midfield time for the former \u2013 or a mercurial double act up forward that threatens to give opposition defenders nightmares. Latrelle Pickett turns 20 in a few weeks, but enjoyed a standout season laced with brilliance and loads of goals in the SANFL that propelled him up draft boards. Melbourne have lacked that type of forward, particularly when Pickett is further afield, so pencil him into the Demons\u2019 23 now. Dyson Sharp (Essendon) There might not be a readier draftee than the robust and combative Sharp, the Larke medallist as the best-performed player at this year\u2019s under-18 championships. He is an excellent stoppage player, and has enough burst to escape immediate trouble. Sharp\u2019s leadership qualities should help his cause, too. The Bombers parted with fringe midfielders Ben Hobbs and Will Setterfield, plus veteran Dylan Shiel, so it is easy to picture Sharp playing straight away. North Melbourne legend Glenn Archer helped welcome Lachy Dovaston to the club. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nLachy Dovaston (North Melbourne) Loading Dovaston will back himself to edge out Jacob Konstanty and slot straight into the Roos\u2019 senior side, alongside Nick Larkey, Cam Zurhaar and Paul Curtis. He was widely viewed as the best small forward in this year\u2019s draft class and ended up being the second one picked, behind Latrelle Pickett. Dovaston\u2019s running capacity and defensive commitment should endear him to coach Alastair Clarkson, while he brings a goalscoring punch that Konstanty does not. Sam Swadling (Collingwood) Swadling was a third-round selection, No.37 overall, but don\u2019t let that fool you.

Many of our viewing decisions are driven by the buzz of the new, that excited chatter that accompanies the latest must-see arrival. But one of the pleasures beyond the thrill of discovery can come from familiarity, the satisfaction that accompanies a show that rewards investment over years.\n\nLoading\n\nThere\u2019s an art to nurturing a satisfying series beyond an absorbing debut season. It requires skill and vision. Some writers and producers manage it, others definitely don\u2019t. And when they drop the ball, a special kind of bitterness comes from devotees who feel betrayed by a second-season slump. Hell hath no fury like fans who feel dudded. Just look at the disapproval heaped on the last two instalments of Squid Game and the sophomore outing of Nobody Wants This, or the chorus of \u201cmeh\u201d in the wake of Wednesday\u2019s return.\n\nIt\u2019s disheartening to discover that a show that you\u2019ve loved has lost its spark or run out of steam. Maybe the eagerly awaited encore feels like it\u2019s not progressing so much as rehashing established elements because it\u2019s already used up all the good ideas (see The Night Agent). Maybe the characters seem stuck in a rut and predictable (see Industry). Maybe it jumps the shark, launching in directions so wildly implausible that it feels like the product of desperation rather than inspiration (see Big Little Lies).\n\nSo how do producers keep their productions humming along with energy and inventiveness? Over the past year, we\u2019ve been treated to a trio of decidedly different series that illustrate how to accomplish it in style.",

SBS News 05:10 English\n\nAustralia came in fifth in the trust ranking at 69 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was ahead of the UK, where 64 per cent of respondents said they could trust others, and the US, where 55 per cent said they could trust others.\n\n\n\n\n\nItaly rounded out the list of high-income nations, with 56 per cent saying they couldn't trust others.\n\n\n\nSource: Getty Residents of nine middle-income countries ranked lower on the trust scale on average, with only 27 per cent of people trusting others.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country indicating the least trust was T\u00fcrkiye, with just per 14 cent of people saying they cannot trust others. This was followed by Mexico at 18 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe centre said its studies have shown that people who trust others are more likely to help their neighbours in times of need and also have more trust in institutions.\n\n\n\nWorld becoming more trustworthy\n\nThe centre's findings suggest people across the world are finding each other more trustworthy when compared to previous years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndonesia experienced a jump from 41 to 53 per cent of people trusting others over the past 12 months.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Hungary and South Africa also saw increases of 9 and 8 per cent, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral nations, including Australia, Italy and T\u00fcrkiye have stayed at the same levels of trust, while France experienced the biggest drop, from 50 to 44 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nWealth plays a large role, as people with higher incomes are also more likely to trust others.\n\n\n\nWhat factors influence trust?\n\nThe survey found that education, age and gender can also influence one's trust in others.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople with more education were more likely to be trusting.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn France, 61 per cent of adults with higher levels of education say most people can be trusted, compared with 35 per cent of those with less education.\n\n\n\n\n\nOlder adults were also more trusting than their younger counterparts, with 80 per cent of Australians over 50 years old trusting others.\n\n\n\nThis decreased among younger age groups in Australia, with 66 per cent of those aged 35 to 59 trusting others, and a drop to 55 per cent of those under 34 years of age.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pew Research Center also found that in seven countries, men were more likely than women to trust others.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Argentina, Hungary and Indonesia, men are at least 10 per cent more likely than women to be trusting.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's perhaps no set of numbers as closely watched as those relating to housing. And new housing data from property analytics firm Cotality has provided more evidence of the state of Australia's housing market.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir new data from November shows home values across the country have grown by one percent in November, with the price of a median dwelling now just over $888,000 and Brisbane becoming the second Australian city to reach the one million dollar median home price mark. Cotality Head of Research Eliza Owen says the low value segment - essentially the lower priced properties that would ordinarily be the target for first home buyers - is driving these numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cProperty values that are in the bottom 25 per cent of Australia's dwelling market have increased almost 9 per cent through the year to date, compared 6 per cent increase at the high end of the market. We also see areas like Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide continuing to lead gains. Perth was up a whopping 2.4 per cent over the past month, and we also saw a really strong increase in Darwin over the year, up 17 per cent and it's the same story.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThese numbers from Cotality also suggest an increasing rate of investor participation and falling numbers of first home buyers, something other reports and studies have also found. Greens senator Barbara Pocock says that means in practice, more and more Australians are being pushed out of the market and losing the chance to own their own home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are seeing rise after rise which is putting housing out of reach of young people, out of reach of women trying to escape domestic violence. Labor is pouring fuel on the fire by making things worse. Their 5 per cent deposit scheme is increasing prices for housing and crowding out those first home buyers who come into the market and need to see a price that they can afford.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's not just government policy that plays a role. Interest rates have also loomed large.\n\n\n\n\n\nCotality says interest rate reductions in 2025 helped to take home values seven and a half percent higher over the past 12 months - and these latest numbers from November actually represent a slow down in monthly growth as some buyers hit their limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe property market is expensive. I think it was somewhat revitalized by interest rate reductions in 2025 that's taken home values seven and a half percent higher over the past 12 months. But now that we're back at this stage where interest rates may be on hold for some time. The cracks are starting to show a little bit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEliza Owen says for those who do buy, surging house prices have undone the benefits of three interest rate cuts, with Cotality estimating the cuts increased the borrowing capacity of a median income household by $55,000, while home values have since risen by $60,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nAffordability metrics to the September quarter also show a record high in the national dwelling value to household income ratio. That says the median dwelling value is 8.2 times higher than the annual pre-tax household income, and the levels of income required to service a mortgage at the median value are at 45 percent, a record level.\n\n\n\n\n\nEliza Owens says that might help explain why purchasers have increasingly flocked to the lower end of the price spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's a relatively cheap market with room to grow, but again, I think that's a signal that you have real affordability constraints in this market when even medium and high income buyers are being skewed to the lower value segment of the dwelling market.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're a renter, the outlook on affordability is even worse.\n\n\n\n\n\nRents are rising across every capital city, with the national rental index five per cent higher over the past 12 months - the highest annual rate of growth in a year. Barbara Pocock says too many Australians are struggling to keep up - and she blames Australia's tax system for contributing to the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey're facing the lowest, historically low vacancy rates and rising rent there are solutions out there for our housing crisis. We know we can make a difference. We can end the tax breaks. We can build the public housing. We can end unlimited rent increases making a difference for 1000s and 1000s of Australian families, putting a roof over our heads. Housing is a human right, and we need a response from a Labor Government to make a difference.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's not just the tax system that's come under scrutiny.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia faces an ongoing supply shortfall, and developers say there are issues getting in the way of government policy to boost stocks of social and affordable housing and build-to-rent properties.\n\n\n\n\n\nEliza Owen says there are already 10 percent fewer listings than a year ago - and they're 6 percent below the five year average. But she says a softening of demand as migration levels ease and renters form larger households to escape price increases is not expected to put the brakes on rising prices altogether.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has published landmark guidelines conditionally recommending treating obesity with Ozempic-like medications, amid a global explosion in their use.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WHO guidelines refer to the use of three Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) medications: liraglutide (marketed as Saxenda or Victoza), semaglutide (Ozempic and Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WHO said it was making \"conditional recommendations\" for the long-term use of these therapies to support people living with obesity, as part of an approach that includes \"healthy diets, regular physical activity and support from health professionals\".\n\n\n\n\n\nConditional recommendations made by the organisation are made when it is uncertain whether the desirable consequences of the recommendation outweigh undesirable consequences.\n\n\n\nThe recommendations included that GLP-1 medications may be used as long-term treatment for obesity, excluding pregnant women, and that they may be provided alongside other interventions such as counselling and physical activity and diet goals.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the new guidance \"recognises that obesity is a chronic disease that can be treated with comprehensive and lifelong care\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While medication alone won't solve this global health crisis, GLP-1 therapies can help millions overcome obesity and reduce its associated harms,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAssociate professor Garron Dodd, head of the Metabolic Neuroscience Research Laboratory at the University of Melbourne, told SBS News the guideline is \"historic\" as it's the first time the WHO has \"recognised obesity as a chronic disease requiring lifelong management and not just a failure of an individual's willpower\".\n\n\n\nIncreasing number of Australians on GLP-1 drugs\n\nThe popularity of GLP-1 medications has exploded internationally in recent years.\n\n\n\n\n\nNearly 500,000 Australians \u2014 almost 2 per cent of the adult population \u2014 are using these drugs for weight loss or medical reasons, according to a report led by researchers at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), which has not yet been peer reviewed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe numbers represent a 10-fold increase from May 2020 to April 2025 \u2014 they are also likely an underestimate as there may be more GLP-1 medicines that weren't examined in the report.\n\n\n\nThe guideline came a day after Australia's medicines regulator updated product warnings for GLP-1 medicines for the potential risk of suicidal thoughts and the potential for reduced effectiveness of oral contraception when first taking or increasing the dose of Mounjaro.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WHO said it developed the guideline in response to requests from member states on how to address challenges associated with obesity.\n\n\n\n\n\nObesity was associated with 3.7 million deaths worldwide in 2024, according to the WHO and it said that without \"decisive action, the number of people with obesity is projected to double by 2030\".\n\n\n\n\n\nObesity is defined as having a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 or higher in adults, although some experts are calling for more nuanced measures.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Experts call for 'urgent' scrutiny after weight loss drugs are linked to suicidal thoughts\n\nIn Australia, one in four children aged two to 17 are considered overweight or obese and around 31 per cent of adults are obese.\n\n\n\n'Not a silver bullet'\n\nDodd said that while GLP-1 medications are having \"transformative\" effects on society, they are not a \"silver bullet\" when it comes to treating obesity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obesity is very complex, there's very complex biology that underpins it that GLP-1 [medications] just don't touch. They target symptoms but they don't really target the underlying root causes,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDodd said the next wave of drug development is focusing on trying to target the underlying mechanisms of obesity and diabetes.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE I used Ozempic to help me realise my dream of becoming a mum. It took a toll even after I quit\n\nHowever, some experts also emphasise that obesity prevention still needs to be a point of focus.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Jennifer Wong, head of diabetes at Monash Health, told SBS News that while obesity should be recognised and treated as a chronic disease, Australians live in an 'obesogenic' environment and policies about diet and exercise education are still important.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmeritus professor Elaine Rush, from the Riddet Institute at Auckland University of Technology, told SBS News that while she believes some people need to use GLP-1 medications, she would prefer to see broader, future-oriented recommendations and policies to address obesity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's diet and the quality of the diet and the frequency of it. It's physical activity, it's reduction of stress and it's also being able to breathe fresh air \u2014 which means not smoking but also having non-polluted cities,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\"They are all things that could be prevented or reduced if only we focused on the future, rather than the immediate treatment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the WHO guidelines acknowledge that GLP-1 therapies are the first \"efficacious treatment option for adults with obesity\", they also stress that obesity is a challenge that requires action across societies.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO has outlined three pillars of addressing the causes of obesity, including creating healthier environments, protecting high-risk individuals and ensuring access to lifelong, person-centred care.\n\n\n\n'Limited' long-term data\n\nWong also said the long-term efficacy and safety of GLP-1 medications is \"still unclear\" as they are still relatively new drugs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've had people with type 2 diabetes using them for a long period of time without any significant complications but I think we just need more longer-term data and that's going to be real-world data as well,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the WHO guideline said GLP-1 therapies can be used by adults for long-term treatment of obesity, it also acknowledged there is \"limited data\" on long-term efficacy and safety of these medications.\n\n\n\nThe WHO said its guideline will be continuously updated and expanded in response to evolving evidence and real-world data.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) updated its product warnings for GLP-1 drugs to include potential risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviours, following investigations by the TGA and international regulators.\n\n\n\n'Costly' medication\n\nThe significant costs associated with GLP-1 medications also continue to be a barrier to access in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its guideline, the WHO called for fair access to GLP-1 therapies and said \"deliberate policies\" were needed to overcome health disparities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Not many [patients] can stay on it for a long period of time because it is very costly,\" Wong said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOzempic can cost between $130 and $200 per month, adding up to over $2,000 a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe profits for makers of GLP-1 medications are also difficult to ignore.\n\n\n\n\n\nEli Lilly, manufacturer of tirzepatide products marketed as Mounjaro and Zepbound, was valued at $1.5 trillion last week, making it the first drugmaker to enter an exclusive club dominated by tech giants.\n\n\n\nThe Royal Australian College of GPs has called on the government to subsidise GLP-1 drugs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Wong said the overall cost of these medications to the government would be immense.\n\n\n\n\n\nDodd believes the GLP-1 drugs are likely to become cheaper in coming years.\n\n\n\nExpiring patents on certain GLP-1 medications (the semaglutide patent \u2014 Ozempic, Wegovy \u2014 will finish in some countries starting from next year), the release of oral alternatives that don't require expensive storage, and increased competition from intensive research and development will all contribute to lowering costs, Dodd said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In terms of research, this is probably one of the \u2014 if not the \u2014 hottest areas of science right now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith additional reporting by Reuters.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Key Points A Canstar survey reveals fewer Australians have a non-property related personal debt.\n\nAt the same time, those saddled with debt owe more than in previous years.\n\nExperts say short-term loans carry risks.\n\nFewer Australians have a personal debt, but for those who do, the figure is climbing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's the finding of a national survey by financial comparison site Canstar, which says in a new report personal debt from credit cards, buy now pay later (BNPL) schemes, and education have risen in 2025, contributing to the \"meteoric rise\" of financial pressures facing Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average personal debt carried by Australians, not including mortgages, rose to $17,634 this year, up from $15,179, Canstar said.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the proportion of Australians with a personal debt excluding a property loan fell from 35 to 33 per cent.\n\n\n\nCanstar's annual consumer pulse poll of 2,000 people found housing remains the top concern, followed by the price of groceries, electricity and gas.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile not a top worry for respondents, experts said personal debt can come \"at a very high cost\" when factoring in interest and fees, when compared to other forms of debt.\n\n\n\n\n\nSally Tindall, data insights director at Canstar, said it could take \"tough decisions\" for Australians to reduce their debts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's positive to see fewer people in debt; however, of those that are, the total amount owing is moving in the wrong direction. If that's you, make 2026 the year you knock down what you owe,\" she stated in the survey.\n\n\n\nGood debt vs bad debt\n\nOf those with a debt, men are more likely than women to carry credit card debt at 58 per cent compared to 44 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, women carry a larger share of higher education loans and BNPL-related costs.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Mardy Chiah, an associate professor of finance at the University of Newcastle, said taking on a short-term debt is \"rarely beneficial\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Interest rates on personal loans and credit cards are typically high if not paid within the interest-free period, making them costly and difficult to justify for discretionary spending,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What Black Friday sales shopping does to your brain, and how to stay in control\n\nChiah explained there is good debt and bad debt.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood debt is used to invest in assets that generate future value, such as property and education.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhereas a bad debt is used for immediate consumption or a depreciating asset, like a car or a BNPL loan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everyone should strive to reduce bad debts,\" he said.\n\n\n\nDangers of buy now, pay later\n\nUsing a BNPL scheme can be convenient but puts people at risk of late payments and fees, which are effectively a \"very high interest rate\", Chiah said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you make a $100 purchase and pay a $5 monthly account management fee for two months before fully repaying, the total fee is $10, equivalent to 10 per cent of the purchase price for just two months,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Annualised, this would represent a very high cost of 60 per cent interest rate per annum.\"\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Chiah warned BNPL providers can encourage overspending and impact credit scores and borrowing capacity for delayed or missed repayments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe costs of these debts add more pressure on Australians trying to pay off their property.\n\n\n\n\"Housing remains the nation's top financial concern. Whether it's mortgage repayments or rents, the meteoric rise to what is, for most people, their biggest financial expense has been difficult to shoulder,\" Tindall said.\n\n\n\nSome are managing to save\n\nDespite cost of living concerns, Australians are continuing to save, according to the survey.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of people saving each month in 2025 jumped to 68 per cent, up from 62 per cent in 2024 and 51 per cent the year before.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News The average put away each month has risen to $769, up from $558 in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile more Australians are saving, there is a clear gap between men and women.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average total saved or invested, excluding the family home and superannuation, was $42,945 for women, compared with $58,326 for men.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "On Monday, HBG chief executive Daniel Paton said the club owners had been left out of the loop on commercial announcements \u2013 including the colour scheme of the Tigers\u2019 home jersey next season, which was deemed to be too orange \u2013 less than a year after the board\u2019s restructuring as part of an independent review. The immediate future of Tigers CEO Shane Richardson, who has been closely allied to O\u2019Farrell, has also come into question, with former chairman Lee Hagipantelis predicting he won\u2019t survive into the next NRL season. \u2018My concern [is] that this will disrupt Wests Tigers so fundamentally that it will put them back for another decade.\u2019 Barnier-Crawford report co-author Gary Barnier Following a statement by the four deposed directors, former NSW premier O\u2019Farrell told ABC Sydney Mornings with Hamish McDonald that he was baffled by HBG\u2019s latest move, and forecast potential NRL intervention at the embattled club. \u201cFor reasons I suspect relate to antics within the Holman Barnes Group and the desire for people to get to the top there, we\u2019ve had yet another brain fart affecting the club,\u201d O\u2019Farrell said.\n\n\u201cA year ago, they replaced their chair (Julia Romero) after the best returns Holman Barnes had ever received. And here we are a year later, they\u2019re replacing the board of West Tigers at a time when, on all the indices for the first time in many years, we\u2019ve done well. \u201cWe\u2019ve achieved our first profit, I think, in more than a decade. And at that moment, the owners, as they\u2019re able to, have decided to take this action.\u201d Wests Tigers during one of their on-field highlights from 2025. Credit: Getty Images O\u2019Farrell, who first joined the Tigers as interim chairman in December 2023, foreshadowed the NRL stepping in to sort out the club\u2019s governance issues. The game\u2019s governing body made governance restructuring, including the appointment of independent directors and key performance targets, a condition of loan commitments to the Tigers in 2013. \u201cIf it continues to go to hell in a hand basket, I have no doubt that the NRL will do what the NRL would always do, which is seek to protect the image of rugby league,\u201d O\u2019Farrell said.\n\nInner West Council mayor Darcy Byrne, who was pivotal in securing state and federal funding for Leichhardt Oval upgrades, called for Liquor and Gaming NSW to \u201cinvestigate and intervene\u201d in the club\u2019s administrative issues. Pointing to the Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority\u2019s previous investigation of disharmony and board directors being dismissed, Byrne said that \u201cif this doesn\u2019t demonstrate that there is a problem with governance in that organisation, then nothing will.\u201d Former Wests Tigers chairman Lee Hagipantelis. Credit: Getty Richardson\u2019s role at the club is the next key question, with O\u2019Farrell\u2019s predecessor Hagipantelis predicting he won\u2019t survive into next season. Richardson is one of the most experienced administrators in the game, but could become collateral damage in the latest power play at the Tigers.\n\nRichardson hasn\u2019t yet commented publicly on the situation, but former Tigers chair Hagipantelis predicts he could soon be the next to go. Asked if he felt Richardson wouldn\u2019t be in his position for the start of next season, Hagipantelis told SEN radio: \u201cI agree \u2026 Richardson had, not an unfettered discretion, but a very wide discretion reporting to Barry, as opposed to all the board for a lot of the decision-making that had to be made in relation to the running of an NRL club. \u201cThat level of delegated authority, it\u2019s very hard to bring back, to restrain or to constrain. There will be some issues of concern there, and Richardson will have to think as to whether he can operate now as to how he did previously with the new board.\u201d It has been speculated that Richardson had negotiated clauses in his contract that would result in a payout if there were changes at board level. \u201cI think that would be very much likely,\u201d Hagipantelis said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard those suggestions as well, that the contract was created in such a fashion where his position was solidified in writing and with delegated authority also.",

        "text": "Crypto assets provide a leveraged exposure to \u201crisk-on\u201d or \u201crisk-off\u201d environments. At the moment it is definitely a risk-off environment. That\u2019s why the administration\u2019s desire to make the US the centre of the crypto universe and bring it into the mainstream of US finance is open to debate. It has made the Trump family, and some of Trump\u2019s cabinet members, far wealthier, but are there risks associated with their ambition? Bank of Japan governor Kazuo Ueda\u2019s comments sparked the latest crypto plunge. Credit: Bloomberg The Genius Act provided a legislative framework for stablecoins \u2013 digital tokens, normally with a price fixed at $US1, that are backed with stable and liquid assets that enable them to maintain their value. The Act requires stablecoin promoters issuing their tokens in the US to back them with reserves of cash, short-term Treasury securities or other safe assets. They will have to publish audited financial statements and will be regulated by the US, unless they are regulated by a country with similar rules.\n\nLast week the group behind the biggest stablecoin, USDT, was downgraded by S&P Global Ratings, which assessed Tether\u2019s assets as \u201cconstrained\u201d and cited an increased in high-risk assets. Within the backing for USDT\u2019s $US184.4 billion tokens in circulation are US Treasuries, gold and other commodities, Bitcoin, corporate loans and cash. Loading S&P said Tether provided limited transparency on its reserves and its risk appetite. There was a lack of a robust regulatory framework and no asset segregation. Tether pointed to its track record \u2013 apart from a moment in 2022 when USDT\u2019s price sank as low as US95\u00a2 during a panic within the crypto market it has generally maintained its peg with the US dollar \u2013 and said it led the industry in transparent reporting. It also said it had total assets of $US215 billion and liabilities of $US184 billion, leaving surplus reserves of about $US30 billion it could call on if necessary. Tether doesn\u2019t meet the criteria set by the Genius Act, so will probably need to establish a new US-compliant vehicle if it wants to continue issuing tokens to US investors. Originally headquartered in the British Virgin Islands, this year it moved to crypto-friendly El Salvador.\n\nWhile it is conceivable that the Trump administration might declare that El Salvador\u2019s regulations are sufficient \u2013 Trump has a good relationship with its president, Nayib Bukele, who has controversially accepted, and imprisoned, some of the administration\u2019s deported immigrants \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be a good look, even for Trump, to allow an entity that the Biden administration accused of money-laundering, sanctions busting and assisting terrorist groups and arms dealers into the regulated centre of US finance. Tether\u2019s current asset base would also disqualify it from compliance with the Genius Act\u2019s requirements. The Genius Act is expected to dramatically increase the size of the stablecoin market, from several hundred billion dollars to several trillion dollars. Because of the asset requirements \u2013 short-term Treasuries, cash and similar high-quality assets \u2013 stablecoins could end up being major investors in US government debt. A new, essentially forced, source of buying would help moderate US bond yields at the shorter end of the yield curve and help lower the cost of US government debt. US debt issuance has increasingly targeted short-dated (and lower interest cost) bonds in recent years.\n\nAs the second half of this year has shown, however, crypto markets are inherently volatile and, while they might be stable in most circumstances, as a crypto asset class, stablecoins aren\u2019t entirely immune from contagion. The steady flows of buying of Treasuries to match inflows of investors funds into their stablecoins could reverse and turn into torrents of forced selling in a general crypto panic. The behaviour of the crypto market over the past couple of months underscores how, even with continuing infusion of institutional investors in response to the crypto-friendly (and crypto active) Trump administration, volatile it is. There\u2019s a more leveraged relationship with yields in forced sales than there is in normal buying \u2013 if Treasuries were being dumped, the yields would spike significantly. Whatever the benefits from a new sourced of buying, they would be dwarfed by the consequences of forced selling. The administration might think they\u2019ve found a clever way to help suppress US bond yields and reduce its interest costs, but a crisis in the crypto market could spill over into volatility and instability in the most important financial market in the US, indeed in the globe. If there were a more general financial crisis, turmoil in the crypto market would amplify its effects on the epicentre of the financial system.",

The American chief executive of Woodside Energy is bringing the Australian oil and gas giant back to her old home. Its $US17.5 billion ($26.71 billion) Louisiana LNG project, just off the Gulf of America/Mexico, is the company\u2019s biggest US investment, and the largest foreign direct investment in Louisiana\u2019s history. The gas yield is potentially massive: 27 million tonnes a year. That\u2019s basically equivalent to Woodside\u2019s combined Australian operations. Trump\u2019s energy and interior secretaries have praised the project for helping unleash \u201cAmerican energy dominance\u201d. Speaker Mike Johnson appeared virtually at the groundbreaking. Woodside bought the Driftwood LNG project, as it was then known, last year under Joe Biden, but made a final investment decision in April. If the US is \u201copen for business\u201d, as the president likes to say, Woodside is shaping up as a great customer. \u201cI had a \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u2019 approach to who I was at work,\u201c: Woodside chief executive Meg O\u2019Neill came out when she moved to Australia.

We get our orders in quickly: I indulge my Australian sensibilities with avocado toast and a cortado (effectively a piccolo), while O\u2019Neill goes for a salmon bagel and black coffee.

The job took her around the world, including Indonesia, where she split her time between Jakarta and the gas fields of Aceh \u2013 and she was there for the devastating 2004 tsunami that killed at least 225,000 people. She has also lived in Texas, Norway and the remote Canadian city St John\u2019s on Newfoundland island. The bill for lunch at Ai Fiori in New York.

Here, the motto is \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d, but in Australia, Woodside faces growing scrutiny of its climate and environmental impact.

She believes the discourse is changing: not just because of the new administration in Washington, but a growing realisation that powering the artificial intelligence era and its energy-hungry data centres will require massive supplies of reliable energy, including from fossil fuels. She says Trump\u2019s pro-energy, anti-climate dogma is having an impact outside the US, including in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging some views that have been probably accepted without a lot of question or debate for a few years,\u201d O\u2019Neill says. O\u2019Neill at Woodside\u2019s Karratha gas plant. \u201cIt\u2019s opening the conversation up to one that\u2019s not just, \u2018We have to solve climate change and forget about everything else\u2019, to one that says: actually, we have to solve a number of different problems, and the solution may not be perfect for any one of those dimensions.\u201d O\u2019Neill notes that some European nations are increasingly conscious of losing their manufacturing edge due to the high price of energy compared with the US and China. Indeed, a day after our lunch, Germany confirms plans to subsidise energy prices for heavy industry to bolster its stagnating economy. In Australia, the Albanese government wants to reduce emissions by 62 to 70 per cent by 2035, a target O\u2019Neill calls \u201chighly ambitious\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know that the ramifications for society have been fully thought through, or described to the Australian people,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nO\u2019Neill and Resources Minister Madeleine King at last year\u2019s Midwinter Ball in Canberra. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen How would she describe it, then? The lower-hanging fruit is gone, so deeper emissions cuts mean large-scale changes to electricity generation, and dumping coal. \u201cWhile there are visions of how we might get there, the permitting is not keeping up, the environmental approvals are not keeping up with that,\u201d she says. \u201cThe question of how you maintain reliable power with a heavy renewable input \u2013 that has not been addressed. How do you decarbonise heavy industry \u2013 has not been addressed. You\u2019re seeing examples of industry flagging that increases in power prices are causing them to rethink the value of their investments. That\u2019s going to be a choice between: do we keep jobs or do we cut emissions? So, Australia [will] have to start to confront some of these questions that Europe is confronting today.\u201d O\u2019Neill\u2019s salmon bagel arrives deconstructed; she declares it \u201cvery tasty\u201d. My avocado toast is fine, but could do with some feta (high standards!). The coffee is mid. For fossil fuel producers like Woodside, the times are arguably bending in their favour. The political heat has come out of climate change in developed countries, usurped by cost-of-living concerns. While most voters still say climate change is a major threat, the percentage has fallen from its 2018-22 era highs, the Pew Research Centre has found \u2013 from Europe to Canada to South Korea and Australia.

What climate responsibility, if any, does Woodside think it has in this new world? O\u2019Neill adheres strictly to the disputed mantra that gas is a transition fuel that can replace coal rather than displace renewables. She suggests critics of gas are doing the coal lobby\u2019s bidding. \u201cIn Australia, there\u2019s been probably close to 20 years of this anti-gas sentiment, which has at the end of the day resulted in brown coal staying in the mix longer,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s people who are true environmentalists who are driving the anti-gas movement, or if it\u2019s people who are in the coal industry, but the outcome is poor for the environment and it\u2019s going to end up being poor for the consumers.\u201d She points to taxpayer subsidies to keep coal plants open. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for anyone.\u201d Protesters at Woodside\u2019s annual meeting in Perth last year.

Moreover, the extension is only justified if Woodside and its partners ultimately get access to the Browse basin near the pristine Scott Reef, considered the country\u2019s largest untapped conventional gas resource. Those approvals are ongoing. Still, the Australian government and companies like Woodside are increasingly singing from the same song sheet on environmental laws, complaining that it takes too long to assess major projects. Woodside was ropeable that it took six years for the West Australian government to approve the NWS extension, before the baton was passed to the federal government for a separate assessment.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size One of the first things that catches the eye when you drive into Club Marconi in Bossley Park is a large metal soccer ball on stilts. Like the team that plays here, it has a storied history. Constructed for the 1993 FIFA World Youth Championship held in Australia, the ball was rolled onto the field at the old Sydney Football Stadium as part of the tournament\u2019s opening ceremony, then placed on its stand and lit up by surrounding pyrotechnics. After the tournament, nobody knew what to do with it \u2013 except the then-Marconi president Tony Labbozzetta, who saw an historic ornament befitting his club, the champions of the National Soccer League that season. He organised for the giant ball to be erected over the turnstiles at Marconi Stadium, where all spectators pass through on the way to their seats. Over time, its lustre faded, its painted exterior giving way to rust and grime. In the opening scene of the book The Death and Life of Australian Soccer, author Joe Gorman sketches a picture of institutional decline on the day in 2015 that Marconi were relegated to the ignominy of NSW\u2019s second division, a depth they hadn\u2019t plumbed in almost half a century. Gorman describes the ball as a \u201crelic of a bygone era, similar to one of those dusty old silos in a long-forgotten rural town.\u201d It\u2019s looking much better these days. \u201cIt was due for a nice paint job,\u201d admits Robert Carniato, Marconi\u2019s football chairman. In preparation for the new Australian Championship, and Marconi\u2019s return to national competition for the first time in 21 years, it was given a much-needed facelift \u2013 and it is standing proudly again above the gates, symbolic now of possibility, not decay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven the jersey Marconi wore for their semi-final against Brisbane side Moreton City Excelsior was a throwback: a modern adaptation of the club\u2019s 1993 kit, the sort of garish design that is very much in vogue again. Club Marconi itself, a true Sydney sporting institution, has also been recently renovated; you can see why they call this place \u201cthe Palace\u201d. But traces of the recent past remain, like a sign instructing patrons that the only national flag allowed to be flown in the venue is the Australian one. That rule is outdated. In 2019, Football Australia lifted the ban on national flags, and on Saturday afternoon, the Italian tricolour was everywhere. Marconi\u2019s jersey for the inaugural Australian Championship is a throwback to 1993. Credit: Damian Briggs/Football Australia The searing 35-degree heat and accompanying hairdryer-like wind would have kept some people away, but there were plenty streaming into the stadium, underneath the ball \u2013 at least four times the number they\u2019d usually see for a regular NPL fixture, club officials say. Carniato\u2019s late father and grandfather were founding members of the club, back in the days when pretty much everyone who came here was a newly arrived Italian migrant. As the diaspora assimilated into Australian society, that fan base dwindled. \u201cOur supporters are basically elderly \u2013 or mums and dads because, obviously, we get a lot of our kids to come and watch the game,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019re starting to get a lot more young people interested.\u201d For example: Cameron Lowe, 20, who is part of The Stables, the self-appointed Marconi active supporter group. When this masthead met them pre-match, they consisted of precisely six blokes: five in Marconi jerseys and one in a Parramatta Eels top, most of whom were on the pre-midday beers. Only one of them has an Italian background, which is perhaps illustrative of the new Marconi. They are too young to have experienced the glory days themselves, but old enough to have heard stories about them, and keen to help bring them back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLowe is also a Western Sydney Wanderers fan, but wasn\u2019t planning on going to the A-League\u2019s Sydney derby at CommBank Stadium that night. \u201cAll I care about is this,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit more raw, and I prefer it. It\u2019s less media, it\u2019s less all this \u2026 because it is a lot smaller in comparison, it\u2019s a bit more compact, you can hear everything, you feel everything. Marconi\u2019s unofficial active supporter group The Stables. Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong \u201cWe\u2019ve come to all the games here. It\u2019s been generational. I\u2019ve never felt better about football. I\u2019ve never enjoyed Australian football as much as I have now, and I cannot wait for the NPL season to start next year \u2013 or whatever the next step is for the Australian Championship.\u201d Inside the VIP area, where pizza, pasta and Italian meats and cheeses are being served for lunch, Socceroos coach Tony Popovic is watching the game with John Tsatsimas, his former chief executive at Western Sydney Wanderers, and Mark Ivancic, the chairman of Sydney United 58, Popovic\u2019s boyhood club. Anthony Caceres, a Marconi junior who now plays for Macarthur FC and the Socceroos, is sitting a few rows ahead. The room is a snapshot of Australian football\u2019s past and present, converging at a place that helped shape both. FA chairman Anter Isaac is in the house, too, explaining how we got here. Isaac has played a key role in the development of the Australian Championship, a new national second-tier competition involving eight \u201cfoundation\u201d clubs, such as Marconi, and eight other qualifiers from around the country, like Moreton City, the NPL Queensland champions. The Championship is not so much a separate league, which is what the foundation clubs initially wanted, but an end-of-year Champions League-style tournament. The standard of play is somewhere between the NPL and the A-League, though crowds have varied wildly from a few hundred to a few thousand.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt matches our expectations,\u201d Isaac says. \u201cWe thought early on people would be excited, enthusiastic, but also maybe hesitant, not quite sure of what this competition\u2019s about. \u201cOne point that I keep trying to make internally is you can\u2019t build a trend line off one data point. You can\u2019t build a trend line off two data points. Three data points, you can start finding things out, whether it\u2019s working or not.\u201d Football Australia chairman Anter Isaac. Credit: Getty Images There will be at least five data points. Despite pre-launch rumours that it would be short-lived, Isaac says FA\u2019s board has decided to support the Championship for five years. It is a loss-making exercise, but the federation sees it as more of an investment in the game, one that is intended to give further opportunities to players, coaches, referees and administrators, and aspirational NPL clubs a suitable environment to increase their operations. Those clubs, that have been calling for a second division almost since the A-League started two decades ago, are now coming to terms with what that requires, and the difficulties of reaching the benchmarks set by FA: not just better football, but better marketing, merchandising, membership, sponsorship and brand awareness. There were some \u201cnerves\u201d among A-League clubs when it launched, Isaac says, but now they\u2019ve seen it for themselves, they realise it is not so much a direct threat but an opportunity, and an incubator they could soon benefit from. By the time the A-League next expands, Isaac hopes clubs such as Marconi, courtesy of their experiences in the Championship, will be in a position to table a serious, legitimate bid to rejoin the full-time professional ranks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably the more reasonable pathway for them in the medium to long term,\u201d Isaac says. The match itself is decent fare, though it suffered a little because of the conditions, forcing drinks breaks to be taken in each half \u2013 but it was a tense, hard-fought contest, won 1-0 by Marconi thanks to Matej Busek\u2019s 80th-minute goal. Marconi Stadium was buzzing on Saturday. Credit: Sitthixay Ditthavong The crowd was lively, too, and gave it to Moreton City\u2019s coach when he received a yellow card for dissent. \u201cGo back to Queensland,\u201d he was told by one punter. The crowd was also, to be blunt, small. The official attendance was just 1477, but in a close-knit venue like this, it felt like a lot more than that \u2013 and better than some A-League games feel in bigger, more cavernous stadiums. The Championship averaged attendances of about 1500 during the group stage, with Marconi\u2019s crowds putting them in the upper half of the competition. Still, those aren\u2019t the sort of numbers that will return Marconi to the promised land, and they know it. Growth will take time, effort and money.\n\nAdvertisement",

He is a high-impact player who brings a lethal combination of speed and endurance, and uses his athletic assets to take the game on. Rebuilding Richmond showed a willingness this year to blood young players, so expect the Tigers to find a way to unleash Grlj early next year. Xavier Taylor and Latrelle Pickett join a new-look Melbourne squad. Credit: Justin McManus Xavier Taylor (Melbourne) The Demons\u2019 recruiters were doing cartwheels when Taylor slipped through to them. He developed impressively across the season, culminating in his best-on-ground performance in the Eastern Ranges\u2019 grand final triumph. Taylor is 192 centimetres, which helps him impact the game aerially in defence, where he is an excellent interceptor. He is not afraid to take the game on, but also stands up defensively and has improved his decision-making, which will help him play early, while he is confident enough to back himself. Latrelle Pickett (Melbourne)\n\nLoading Kysaiah Pickett\u2019s cousin has joined him at the Demons, and his arrival could lead to more midfield time for the former \u2013 or a mercurial double act up forward that threatens to give opposition defenders nightmares. Latrelle Pickett turns 20 in a few weeks, but enjoyed a standout season laced with brilliance and loads of goals in the SANFL that propelled him up draft boards. Melbourne have lacked that type of forward, particularly when Pickett is further afield, so pencil him into the Demons\u2019 23 now. Dyson Sharp (Essendon) There might not be a readier draftee than the robust and combative Sharp, the Larke medallist as the best-performed player at this year\u2019s under-18 championships. He is an excellent stoppage player, and has enough burst to escape immediate trouble. Sharp\u2019s leadership qualities should help his cause, too. The Bombers parted with fringe midfielders Ben Hobbs and Will Setterfield, plus veteran Dylan Shiel, so it is easy to picture Sharp playing straight away. North Melbourne legend Glenn Archer helped welcome Lachy Dovaston to the club. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nLachy Dovaston (North Melbourne) Loading Dovaston will back himself to edge out Jacob Konstanty and slot straight into the Roos\u2019 senior side, alongside Nick Larkey, Cam Zurhaar and Paul Curtis. He was widely viewed as the best small forward in this year\u2019s draft class and ended up being the second one picked, behind Latrelle Pickett. Dovaston\u2019s running capacity and defensive commitment should endear him to coach Alastair Clarkson, while he brings a goalscoring punch that Konstanty does not. Sam Swadling (Collingwood) Swadling was a third-round selection, No.37 overall, but don\u2019t let that fool you. He was an under-18 All-Australian, has a knack for finding the Sherrin, has already proven himself against men in the WAFL, and is creative with his hands. The Magpies are attempting to rebuild their Nick Daicos-led midfield \u2013 and just delisted Tom Mitchell and Fin Macrae \u2013 so there are opportunities, but it is more likely that Swadling eases his way in across half-forward.",

(James Ross/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nEconomist estimates of Australia's housing shortfall range from 200,000 to 300,000 homes.\n\nThe federal government's National Housing Accord has set a target of 1.2 million new homes by mid-2029, but current approvals are falling well short of the required run rate.\n\nBuilding consents fell 6.4 per cent to 15,832 in October, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Tuesday.\n\nThat's below the 20,000 per month rate required to meet the target.\n\nThe drop was driven by a 39.2 per cent decline in apartment approvals.\n\nApartment approvals are particularly volatile and fluctuate wildly each month, but the trend line has barely increased for the past 12 months.\n\nHousing Minister Clare O'Neil said the federal government was slashing red and green tape to speed up approvals.\n\nA \"strike team\" of bureaucrats established to clear a backlog of housing projects held up by environmental laws had ticked off on 14,000 homes - out of a total of 26,000 - since the government's economic roundtable in August.\n\n\"We have a housing crisis in this country because for 40 years we just haven't been building enough homes. Speeding up the time it takes for a housing project to get approved is going to make a big difference to that,\" Ms O'Neil said.\n\n\n\n\"It's simply too hard to build a house in Australia today. There are endless layers of bureaucracy across three levels of government to wade through before builders can lay a brick.\"\n\nClare O'Neil says slashing red and green tape has expedited building approvals. (Lukas Coch/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nEfforts to address housing affordability have focused excessively on the extremes of high-rise apartments or large houses on the suburban fringes, CEDA senior economist Danika Adams said.\n\n\"But 'gentle density' can deliver more housing in middle-ring neighbourhoods where people want to live, while making better use of existing infrastructure and transport networks,\" Ms Adams said.\n\nThe report urged governments to copy planning reforms undertaken in Auckland nearly a decade ago.\n\nChanges to zoning laws that abolished single family zoning and allowed medium-density housing across three-quarters of the city resulted in an estimated 50 per cent increase in building consents within five years.",
