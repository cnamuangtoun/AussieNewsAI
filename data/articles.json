(Instagram/@savannahguthrie)\n\n\"We received your message, and we understand. We beg you now to return our mother to us,\" Guthrie said.\n\n\"This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.\"\n\nIt is the third time the family has directly addressed the kidnappers since Guthrie's disappearance .\n\nInvestigators think Nancy Guthrie was taken against her will from her home just outside Tucson, Arizona last weekend. DNA tests showed blood on Guthrie's front porch was a match to her, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said.\n\nAuthorities have not identified any suspects or ruled anyone out.\n\nInvestigations into Nancy Guthrie's dissapearance have been hampered by incomplete or missing evidence. (NBC via CNN Newsource)\n\nSavannah Guthrie was referencing a message that was sent to the Tucson-based television station KOLD on Friday afternoon (Saturday AEDT), according to Kevin Smith, a spokesperson for the FBI office in Phoenix.\n\nKOLD said it received an email related to the Guthrie case on social media that day but declined to share specific details about its contents as the FBI conducted its review.\n\nThe station was one of multiple press outlets that received alleged ransom letters during the week. At least one letter made monetary demands and established Thursday evening and the following Monday evening as deadlines.\n\nLaw enforcement officials declined to affirm that the letters were credible but said all tips were being investigated seriously. They also said one letter referenced Nancy Guthrie's Apple watch and a specific feature of her property.\n\nPresident Donald Trump claims the investigation is going well. (AP)\n\nIt has been reported that a camera at Nancy Guthrie's home was not able to capture images of anyone the day she went missing.\n\nInvestigators have found that the home's doorbell camera was disconnected early on Sunday and that software data recorded movement at the home minutes later. However, Nancy Guthrie did not have an active subscription, so none of the images were able to be recovered.\n\nDespite this, President Donald Trump , speaking on Air Force One, said the investigation was going \"very well\".\n\n\"We have some clues that I think are very strong,\" Trump said, while en route to his Florida estate. \"We have some things that may be coming out reasonably soon.\"\n\nReported with Associated Press\ufeff",

        "text": "Like many young people, Bailee has faced criticism from older people about her screen time.\n\n\"My mum is always like, 'it's that phone', like every single time I do something wrong, she's like, 'it's that phone,'\" the 24-year-old told triple j hack.\n\nBut after spending time with her mother, Bailee said she was not convinced she was the only one whose relationship with screens was a problem.\n\n\"My mum's addicted to Candy Crush,\" she said.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"I'll try to talk to her for like a solid 30 seconds and she's just locked in on something, and I literally look and it's just a bubble popping game.\"\n\nSocial media bans target teenagers\n\nEarlier this week, Spain and Greece joined countries including Britain and France in considering introducing tougher stances on social media, after Australia in December became the first nation to prohibit access to some platforms for children aged under 16.\n\nAs in Australia, the focus in other countries in debates about mental health and screen time is on teenagers and young adults, but young people have told triple j hack they are noticing older people are in the grips of their devices too.\n\n\"The older generation is a bit more addicted than they want to admit,\" Bailee said.\n\nBailee, 24, thinks her mum is addicted to the game Candy Crush. (Supplied)\n\nA YouGov survey conducted last year in the United States suggested older people were clocking significant screen time, with more than half of 45 to 64-year-olds reporting spending five or more hours per day looking at screens, and one in five estimating their screen time at between seven and eight hours daily.\n\nAnd while the survey, which polled more than 1,000 people, did show younger people spent the most time on screens \u2014 70 per cent of 18 to 29-year-olds reported five or more hours a day, while nearly one in three spent at least nine hours \u2014 neuropsychologists say the differences between the age groups are narrowing over time.\n\n'Digital natives' can help parents: psychologist\n\nMichoel Moshel, a Melbourne-based neuropsychologist who has researched the impact of screens on the brain, said screen time was rising across all age groups.\n\nBut Dr Moshel said he believed younger \"digital natives\" may be able to play a role in helping older people recognise problematic screen use.\n\n\"I think this is one of the skills that actually younger people are a lot more comfortable in the digital environment than older people,\" Dr Moshel told triple j hack.\n\n\"So, I think there is some place for younger people, if they feel like they are in control of their technology use \u2026 to have a very frank conversation with their parents, with their grandparents, and say, 'Look, there's a lot of these features that are in-built into these technologies that wrestle this control we have away from us'.\n\n\"I think for elderly people, this might not be as intuitive as it is for younger people.\"\n\nMichoel Moshel specialises in the intersection of digital technology and brain health. (Supplied)\n\nAccording to the YouGov survey, younger people in the United States were also more likely to acknowledge their struggles with screen time, with almost 70 per cent of 18 to 29-year-olds wanting to cut back on their screen use and nearly half saying they had intentionally tried to reduce their screen time within the past 12 months.\n\nBut for Bailee, spending time away from screens is harder to implement than it is to commit to.\n\n\"Your wallet's on your phone, all your personal details are on your phone \u2014 you have to have a phone to be able to be in society at this point,\" she said.\n\nBut one observation, she said, was the uptake of scrolling, watching reels, playing games and seeking the dopamine-driven reward cycles that app developers can manipulate to keep users engaged.\n\n\"It is also like a quick dopamine hit, I think for everybody, but I think, like, it's other generations included now,\" Bailee said.\n\nJess, 22, says an older woman complimented her and her friend for \"actually speaking to each other\". (Supplied)\n\nJess, 22, has also tried cutting back \u2014 including by setting time limits on some apps and deleting others altogether \u2014 but, she said, largely without success.\n\n\"I would say I'm in a constant limbo of trying to get my screen time lower, and I fear I've been failing for years,\" she told hack.\n\nJess also said that, over time, her parents had become more understanding of her generation's phone use.\n\n\"When I was younger, my parents used to be like, 'You're wasting your life on your phone', whereas now they're coming a bit more to the understanding of like, 'Actually, this is the generation you're in and you're used to being on your phone 24/7,'\" Jess said.\n\nBut still, she said, there had also been comments from older people about younger people and their phones, including one time when she said a woman approached her and her friends.\n\n\"She was like, 'I just have to tell you, it's so refreshing to see a group of young people just actually speaking to each other and not being on their phones,'\" she told hack.\n\nA YouGov survey in the United States found 11 per cent of adults leave their phone in another room at night. (Adobe Stock: terovesalainen)\n\nDifferent generations watching different screens\n\nResearchers say Australian data on screen time, broken down by age, is not regularly collected, but one dataset published by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on screen time in 2020-21 suggested time spent watching TV and video screens increased with age, with interwar and baby boomer generations recording daily averages of more than three hours.\n\nAccording to the same dataset, gen Z females spent the most time on their phones, while gen Z males played digital games for longer than any other generation.\n\nJazmin, Jess, Bailee and Blaize reflect on screen time with triple j hack. (triple j hack: Alice Angeloni)\n\nIn terms of problematic screen use, Dr Moshel said some statistics suggested that about one in 10 people have a problem with time spent in front of screens, which he said was defined as a loss of control over screen time with negative consequences.\n\nDr Moshel said somewhere between 3 and 5 per cent of people were addicted to screens in a clinical sense.\n\n\"Typically, when I speak to people who have some sort of problematic relationship, it's that 'I can't get off it' \u2026 so I have an intention, the amount of time that I want to spend, the sort of platforms that I want to use, but I'm really finding no matter how much I try to intentionally use these technologies, I'm just not able to.\n\n\"The negative consequences that they're experiencing as a result of this loss of control \u2026 there has to be a recognition that something is problematic, and that really helps when it comes to trying to turn it back and trying to gain some measure of control.\"\n\nTeenagers experience summer without social media\n\nOn the eve of the implementation of the social media ban in December, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had a message for Australia's youth.\n\n\"Start a new sport, learn a new instrument or read that book that's been sitting there on your shelf for some time,\" Mr Albanese told younger people.\n\nJazmin, 15, said she was booted off most social media apps ahead of summer, and her screen time had reduced because of it.\n\n\"Now I don't have as many apps, I don't really use my socials that much,\" Jazmin told hack.\n\n\"I only use it when I need it, and at first it was like, 'Oh, I feel like I'm missing out on things', but it's actually been pretty good cause I've gotten out more.\"\n\nHer friend Blaize, who at 16 years old is not included in the ban, said he believed his screen time had been impacted, too.\n\n\"I used to be on my phone 24/7 scrolling my friend's posts, talking to everyone, but now I can only talk to people that are my age or higher,\" Blaize said.\n\nAnd on older people's screen time, Blaize said it was something he had noticed too.\n\n\"My mum just uses it to gossip with her friends and play Candy Crush \u2014 same with my pop and my nan.\"\n\nBut among young people and older, 19-year-old Amos shows not everyone is glued to their phone.\n\n\"I don't use it as much as a lot of people my age,\" Amos said.\n\nHe said he only used his phone for essentials, as he had seen among the older people in his life, too.\n\n\"I feel like I kind of used to be like that in high school, but now I just use it for, I guess, more necessities and ways to keep me happier,\" he said.",

        "text": "Being pregnant comes with a minefield of advice from doctors, midwives, well-meaning friends and family, not to mention social media and other mums.\n\nThere are foods you're recommended to avoid, and medications that aren't approved. But skincare is less clear: some products are fine whereas others are not recommended.\n\nThe family of ingredients known as retinoids, for example, are booming in popularity in skincare products but there is conflicting advice on their safety for pregnant women.\n\nWhat are retinoids?\n\nRetinoids is an umbrella term for vitamin A derivatives that treat all manner of skin concerns from acne to wrinkles, fine lines and pigmentation.\n\n\"They're pretty much the gold standard skincare ingredients because they work for so many things,\" says Michelle Wong, a chemist and science communicator based in Sydney.\n\nRetinoids come in different forms.\n\nThe most potent are prescription-only acne treatment drugs such as isotretinon, which is taken orally, and tretinoin which is applied to the skin to treat severe acne.\n\nIsotrentinols have clearly labelled packaging. (Supplied: Sam Yarwood)\n\nThen there are pharmacist-only products containing adapalene, and a range of \"over-the-counter\" retinoids such as retinal and retinol which are in topical creams applied to the skin at much lower concentrations.\n\nIt's widely accepted that oral retinoids are not safe for pregnant women and may cause birth defects \u2014 and that is labelled clearly on the packaging and drug information leaflets. Prescription-only and pharmacist-only topical retinoids also carry warnings.\n\nBut what about over-the-counter (OTC) topical retinoid products?\n\nConfusing advice for pregnant women\n\nNSW Health's Mothersafe, a service for mothers run by NSW Health, says OTC creams are safe for pregnant women to use because they are applied topically and contain smaller doses, but advises against the use of prescription topical treatments.\n\nDr Wong agrees.\n\n\"Looking at standard retinol products on the market, it should be safe for pregnancy, as long as people are not using it in weird ways,\" she says.\n\nBut many health practitioners advise against using any type of topical retinoid.\n\nRetinoids are commonly used to treat acne. (Pixabay: Sharon McCutcheon/ABC Life: Daniel Mee)\n\nLaura Gerhady, a maternal fetal medicine specialist who studies the effects of medication in pregnancy says there is insufficient research to make clear determinations for the use of topical retinoids during pregnancy.\n\n\"Part of that is because most people using topical retinoids will be using them for conditions that are not vital to treat during pregnancy, things like acne.\"\n\nTypes of retinoids Prescription only: Isotretinoin: Strong oral retinoid to treat acne\n\nStrong oral retinoid to treat acne Tretionoin: A topical retinoid used for acne and skin ageing\n\nA topical retinoid used for acne and skin ageing Tazarotene: A topical cream retinoid for acne and psoriasis\n\nA topical cream retinoid for acne and psoriasis Trifarotene: A topical cream to treat acne Non-prescription: Adapalene: A topical retinoid for treating acne.

Products containing this ingredient can only be bought directly from a pharmacist. Retinol: A weaker retinoid, found in OTC skincare products\n\nA weaker retinoid, found in OTC skincare products Retinal: A topical OTC serum, cream or lotion that is stronger than retinol but weaker than prescription retinoids\n\nThere are no mandatory standards for labelling cosmetic skincare products containing retinoids such as retinal and retinol. The only non-prescription topical products that require labelling are those containing adapalene. These products were recently downgraded from prescription-only and made available as behind-the-counter products in pharmacies.\n\nDr Gerhardy says there isn't clear labelling because there isn't a specific guideline on what is and isn't safe.\n\n\"For [all] topical retinoids, the message is that we don't have great information, but if you use it, it's probably fine.\n\n\"To communicate that in a single sentence on packaging is quite difficult. It is straightforward with oral retinoids \u2014 they are certainly harmful in pregnancies.\n\n\"But topical is more challenging because we just don't have the data,\" she says.\n\nRetinols are a type of retinoid that treat fine lines. (Unsplash)\n\nAs research about both prescription and OTC topical retinoids is limited, guidance from health practitioners is typically interchangeable.\n\nDeshan Sebaratnam, a dermatologist at Liverpool Hospital says he advises his pregnant patients to avoid using all retinoids \u2014 including retinol \u2014 as a precaution.\n\n\"Much like alcohol, the safest choice would be to avoid retinol in pregnancy but the absolute risk is low,\" he says.\n\nLikewise, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says that even though the amount absorbed by the body is low, neither prescription nor OTC products are recommended.\n\nWhat happens if you accidentally use a topical retinoid while pregnant?\n\nDr Wong says pregnant women who may have used topical retinoids without knowing should not be alarmed.\n\n\"Topical retinoids are generally not recommended during pregnancy but it's not worth panicking about if you accidentally use it once or twice,\" she says.\n\n\"If applied topically, the amount of product that would enter your system would be quite low.\n\nWhat in the world is retinol? It's widely touted as the \"gold standard\" in anti-ageing skin care, but what is retinol, and do you really need it?\n\n\"Including from prescription creams,\" she says, but adds: \"There's still a hierarchy of risk though. For example, tretinoin is the riskiest one.\"\n\nA large Nordic study published last year found that while the use of topical retinoids had significantly increased over the past 20 years, there was no evidence of increased risk of birth defects in babies exposed to topical retinoids during pregnancy.\n\nWhile the authors say those findings are \"the strongest evidence to date on the safety of topical retinoids during pregnancy\", they also acknowledge their study may underestimate the risk and more research is needed.\n\nIf you are thinking about using topical retinoid products, speak to your healthcare practitioner for advice.\n\nOther skincare ingredients to look out for\n\nProfessor Sebaratnam recommends avoiding minoxidil (a hair growth formula) and hydroquinone, which treats dark spots.\n\n\"Most other over-the-counter beauty products are probably safe,\" he says.\n\n\"But mums need to weigh up whether they really need to be using them or not.\"\n\nABC Health in your Instagram feed Follow @abchealth on Instagram, where we're busting myths and sharing practical, smart health advice.\n\nOther products Dr Wong recommends watching out for are online products that might be unregulated or high doses of salicylic acid, a cleanser that is also a chemical exfoliator.\n\nMothersafe NSW says salicylic acid is safe for use in smaller doses, however \"quantities of salicylic acid absorbed may be higher in specific situations so safety of use should be confirmed with MotherSafe or your healthcare provider.\"\n\nDr Wong also cautions against using beauty products bought online that don't have verified information.\n\n\"I would be cautious about those sorts of products that are really cheap and too good to be true,\" Dr Wong says.\n\nFor most pregnant women, the safest approach is to stick with simplicity; use well-regulated products, and speak to your healthcare practitioner.",

(Getty Images: Hannah Peters)\n\nThat ACL injury is the principal reason Guseli was not able to compete in big air, slopestyle and his favoured half pipe off his own merits due to the time it forced him off the snow and out of competition.\n\nA good thing to put to bed, in that case.\n\nOf course, Guseli was never really supposed to be in the big air final in the first place.\n\nHe shouldn't have even started the qualifiers but for a late call-up after Canadian Mark McMorris went down in practice.\n\n\"To be honest, I took qualies as a little bit of a joke,\" Guseli said.\n\n\"I don't know if that sounds bad, but since I didn't expect to be there, and then when I got there it was such late notice, I sort of \u2026 I had goals, I didn't have expectations.\n\n\"I just went out there and tried to do the best riding I could, and then miraculously I made the finals.\n\n\"And then, yeah, tonight I took it a little bit more seriously.\n\nValentino Guseli landed a jump that had caused him such pain 18 months before. (Getty Images: Hannah Peters)\n\n\"It was the third time I landed the switchback 19 ever in my life, which was my second trick, and it was the first time I ever tried the back 19, which was the last trick that I crashed on. Unfortunately.\"\n\nAs the beats pumped and the crowd gazed up at the whirring phenomena descending upon them from the frigid, inky sky, it's both paradoxically easy and baffling to think you could consider this a laughing matter.\n\nThe towering, 40-metre high structure looms at the end of the postcard picturesque Alpine town like a fairground show \u2014 the most eye-catching of temporary big tops juxtaposed into a high-end snowy paradise.\n\nWith the continuous music and the strobe lights highlighting the surrounding peaks, the event was rave-like amidst the highest stakes of an Olympic final.\n\nValentino Guseli was in with a shot of a medal with a jump to go. (Getty Images: Michael Reaves)\n\n\"I was just stoked to be out there riding,\" Guseli said.\n\n\"First big air final in quite a long time. First big air [Olympic] final \u2026 first big air comp in the Olympics.\n\n\"I left it all out there for sure. I couldn't have tried harder or wanted it more. So yeah, no regrets.\"\n\nThe 20-year-old certainly made the most of his bonus opportunity.\n\nThe 10th-place finish is his best in a big air event since 2023. It is only his fourth big air event since he ruptured his ACL in 2024.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nAnd Guseli was fully aware that he was there thanks to the misfortune of a rival competitor in McMorris, who may yet be forced to give up his slopestyle spot too, although Guseli was not counting on that.\n\n\"I'd say he'll probably be OK for slopestyle, which is really good news because you never want to see one of your competitors not be able to compete, especially someone that's done as much for the sport as Mark has,\" Guseli said.\n\n\"I haven't spoken to him or even seen him or anything, but something that I wanted to make sure I did was \u2026 kind of like, he came out, I went in, so essentially I had his spot and I wanted to do something special with his spot, to sort of just pay my respects to him.\"\n\nAnd given he used his chance, proffered by one injury to banish the memory of another that arguably cost him his spot at the Games in the event anyway, he certainly did it justice.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nA washout in the stocks of software companies has been flowing through Wall Street this week, as investors realised the threat that artificial intelligence will displace businesses had arrived. While the prospect of AI disruptions has hung over the economy for years, a new set of tools released this week by a San Francisco start-up forced a sudden reckoning on Wall Street. Anthropic\u2019s Claude app. A new set of tools released by the company last week sent tech stocks plunging. Bloomberg Software companies most at risk from the new tools were the hardest hit, as well as the investment funds that lend to these companies. But the sell-off helped push down the broader market. On Thursday, the S&P 500 turned negative for the year after falling on six of the past seven days. But it rebounded the next day, rising 1.5 per cent. AI has been like rocket fuel for stocks, driving prices to record highs in recent years. Since October, though, that exuberance has been fading, as some realities of this transformative technology have begun to sink in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only are investors growing worried that AI could render certain businesses obsolete, they are also questioning the growing piles of money that companies are spending on AI. On Thursday, investors were spooked by Amazon\u2019s revelation that it planned to spend $US200 billion ($285 billion) on AI and other large investments this year, exceeding analysts\u2019 predictions by $US50 billion; shares fell 7 per cent on Friday. Last week, Google\u2019s parent Alphabet said it would spend as much as $US185 billion this year, and last week Meta said its capital expenses, in large part to support AI, could reach $US135 billion. In the software sector, the catalyst for the sell-off was the release on Tuesday by San Francisco-based artificial intelligence firm Anthropic of free plug-in software tools that allow companies to automate functions like customer support and legal services. Because they were created as \u201copen source\u201d software, any company can download the tools without paying for them. These plug-ins could replace the tools that companies currently sell to businesses. Another area vulnerable to AI are providers of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, a mode of delivering subscription-based computer programs over the internet instead of buying and installing them locally on one\u2019s computer. New, free software models from AI companies have the potential to replace not only the SaaS business model but also much of the workforce behind it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere have been a number of these big sell-offs of these SaaS stocks over the past few years as these software models have rolled out,\u201d Open AI CEO Sam Altman said in an interview with TBPN, a tech-focused streaming show. \u201cI expect there will be more.\u201d Editor's pick Updated\n\nWorld markets More than $60 billion wiped from ASX in market rout Analysts have taken to calling the broad sell-off the \u201cSaaSpocalypse\u201d. Shares of companies like LegalZoom, LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters, which offer legal services and research, dropped as much as 20 per cent over the past week. They had mixed recoveries after their drop. Shares of Salesforce, which produces SaaS and customer relationship management software for sales workers, have fallen 25 per cent over the past month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven companies catering to the arts have been hit. Shares in Adobe and Figma, which produce tools for artists, fell 9 per cent and 17 per cent over the past week, driven by fears that many of the bread-and-butter design tools they provide to creative workers could eventually be automated. The fervour for AI is not just affecting the software industry. The surge in AI spending has generated enormous demand for random-access memory, or RAM, a kind of chip required to produce the AI hardware built by these companies. Shares of Salesforce, which produces SaaS and customer relationship management software for sales workers, have fallen 25 per cent over the past month. Bloomberg On Wednesday, Qualcomm, which makes microprocessors for smartphones and computers that require RAM, said it faced uncertainty around how much demand it would have for its chips over the next two years. That is, in part, because the skyrocketing cost of memory could dampen consumer demand for new devices. Shares of Qualcomm are down about 20 per cent this year. Software companies have also been a favourite target of lenders of private credit, because the companies\u2019 subscription-based business model provides a stable stream of income to support taking on more debt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivate credit deals, as the name suggests, are not public, but the loans held by related business development companies, or BDCs, are seen as a proxy for the industry. Roughly half the software debt held by BDCs, equal to about $US45 billion, comes due in 2030 or later, according to analysts at Barclays, raising worries about the length of time until these loans are repaid. The more time a borrower has to repay a loan, the more time there is for the borrower to default \u2014 or, in this case, the more time for a business to be displaced by AI. An exchange-traded fund run by VanEck that contains holdings in many of the major BDCs is down about 6 per cent this year and more than 20 per cent over the past 12 months. Even as Ares Management and Blue Owl Capital \u2014 two of the largest private-credit firms \u2014 reported results that Wall Street analysts largely applauded, the two companies couldn\u2019t escape investors\u2019 worries about AI disruption. Shares of Ares have fallen more than 20 per cent this year and Blue Owl\u2019s have fallen over 16 per cent. On an analyst call Thursday, Blue Owl CEO Marc Lipschultz denied that AI posed a threat to its lending business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have red flags, and, point of fact, we don\u2019t have yellow flags. We actually have largely green flags,\u201d Lipschultz said. Editor's pick Opinion\n\nMergers & acquisitions Why Elon Musk just created a $1.8 trillion space monster Stephen Bartholomeusz Senior business columnist Blue Owl chief financial officer Alan Kirshenbaum attributed the company\u2019s challenges to \u201cheadwinds in private credit, AI, software\u201d, as well as investors who want some of their money back. Analysts could find little to worry about in the firm\u2019s results. \u201cIf you took the name off the top of the release and ripped through the details, you\u2019d think that\u2019s a pretty darn good quarter,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note late last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin, a retail-dominated market that tends to swing with some of the popular stock trades, also skidded, sliding as low as $US60,000, its lowest level since October 2024, before rising back towards $US70,000. On Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during a congressional hearing that the government had no power to order banks to buy bitcoin in order to stem the price decline. As investors dial down their exposure to the more speculative bets like bitcoin and AI-related stocks, they are shifting towards previously unloved sectors that are seen as better insulated through periods of volatility. So far this year, energy stocks, consumer staples and the materials sector have all gained over 10 per cent while tech has languished. \u201cAfter years of tech-driven market leadership, the balance of power is shifting as investors rotate toward traditional \u2018old economy\u2019 sectors,\u201d said Angelo Kourkafas, a strategist at fund manager Edward Jones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.

Himali Ratnayake and Janette McBride are the Asian Aunties, a burgeoning Brisbane improv duo whose chemistry was so palpable during their first on-stage appearance in 2025, audiences were urging them to team up. \u201cWe were a Big Fork Theatre Cage Match team, which means the audience votes for who they want to come back the next week, and we won 12 weeks in a row,\u201d McBride says. Aunty Maria from the Philippines (Janette McBride) and Aunty Rani from Sri Lanka (Himali Ratnayake) have some blunt advice to offer audiences at the Brisbane Powerhouse. Nick Dent \u201cWe just became the aunties. We felt the chemistry, and the audience also felt it,\u201d Ratnayake recalls.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Asian Aunties both celebrate and eviscerate the figure of the \u201colder female mentor\u201d prominent in many Asian cultures. In their shows, Aunty Maria from the Philippines (McBride) and Aunty Rani from Sri Lanka (Ratnayake) ask the audience to write their problems on scraps of paper that go into a rice cooker to be plucked out at random. \u201cWe then give advice as the aunties,\u201d McBride says. \u201cIt\u2019s not always good advice,\u201d Ratnayake adds, noting the characters are drawn from life. \u201cWhen I go to Sri Lanka, aunties will ask me those annoying questions. There\u2019s generally love at the core, but it does come across as very direct, and toxic.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcBride\u2019s character is based on her mother, who immigrated to Queensland in 1981. \u201cShe was a very sassy, funny lady and brutally honest. \u201cThis is therapeutic for us,\u201d she laughs. Ratnayake got her PhD at the University of Melbourne and is noted for developing the Flying Fox Heat Stress Forecaster as part of her CSIRO research into biosecurity. She discovered improv at a point in her life when she needed a change and was \u201csaying yes to everything\u201d. McBride left Brisbane as a teenager seeking fame in the Philippines. She was swiftly cast in films, TV productions including Tabing-Ilog (a Filipino answer to teen drama Dawson\u2019s Creek), and was co-host of a talk show, Talk TV, that was cancelled after a year. Back in Brisbane, she has produced the BrisAsia Comedy Gala for the last five years at Big Fork Theatre in the Valley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe show is transferring to the larger stage at the Brisbane Powerhouse for the first time on Saturday, February 14, with a line-up of local and interstate acts. Michael Hing (The Project) is hosting, and stand-ups include Urvi Majumdar, He Huang, Ting Lim, Jo Gowda and Ashwin Segkar. Run by the Brisbane City Council, BrisAsia (February 13-22) marks Lunar New Year across town with food, music, art and performances. McBride says Brisbane is a more welcoming and diverse city now than when she was growing up. \u201cThere weren\u2019t too many mixed-race kids at that time, and so me and my brother were bullied, and asked if we were Chinese or Japanese \u2013 there could just be two. \u201cNow it is more multicultural, and we embrace who we are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrisAsia Festival 2026: 10 more highlights Southside by Night\n\nCar culture fans bring their hot rods to this mix of hip hop and street food.

        "text": "When a developer floats the idea to build housing on a floodplain, it\u2019s best to factor in how well the future residents may need to float too (\u201cHundreds of homes to be built on floodplain\u201d, February 1). Nature and the landscape have ways to remain \u201cbuoyant\u201d despite the travails of extremes in weather and climatic events. Not always so with the human the abode. In simple planning terminology, a plain is often an ideal location to overlay suburbs. A caveat to this easy-fix home installation, is that if the word plain is prefixed by flood, you will have not wanted to come down in the last shower to gauge the inherent rising risks of such a proposal. Steve Dillon, Thirroul\n\nFloods inundated Lismore, NSW, again, in March 2025. Nick Moir\n\nAs a long-time resident of the Hawkesbury area and having experienced numerous floods over the years, I find it incomprehensible that developers are still utilising floodplains to build on. This despite all the evidence available about climate change impacts on rain/flood/storm events and increasing urban runoff, by volume and velocity. It seems that there is a complete lack of will by our politicians to address the serious problems we face around housing and environmental risk. With that in mind, perhaps it\u2019s time to have the insurance sector, along with the banking sector, to provide some guidance around premiums and interest rates they will apply for homeowners in these types of development areas. We already know many people can\u2019t afford insurance for their property and regardless of platitudes the banks will always hold the home owner liable for any debt. It is simply unconscionable for this cavalier approach to housing developments to continue as we know that after every major flood all the stakeholders blame everyone else and demand government assistance, whilst most of the insurers either walk away, dissemble over liability or price themselves out of the market. How simple would it be to identify many of these costs before development? That would be a simple \u201cfactor\u201d to help determine where these developments go. Bernard Stever, Richmond\n\nAn Insurance Council of Australia spokeswoman states, \u201cthere are already more than 240 000 homes in Australia that face a severe to extreme risk of flooding, we should not be adding to this\u201d, regarding the NSW government decision to approve the building of 1000 new homes on a floodplain. Two dictionary definitions sum up this decision. Floodplain: \u201ca trait of low-lying ground which is periodically flooded by a river or creek\u201d, and \u201cunintelligent, foolish\u201d. This decision could cost lives and is setting our state up for a very likely future disaster. John Cotterill, Kingsford\n\nWhile busy committing to buy back homes in flood-prone Lismore the government is giving the green light to a mass housing development at Marsden Park North, rated Sydney\u2019s most flood-prone area. Who will insure these properties? Will taxpayers have to provide relocation assistance when the inevitable floods occur, not to mention the physical and psychological effects of losing all to flood damage? Katriona Herborn, Blackheath\n\nMorrison off mark\n\nJacqueline Maley asks the right questions of Scott Morrison\u2019s words spoken in Israel (\u201cMorrison didn\u2019t hold a hose, but is still happy to fan flames remotely\u201d, February 1), apparently blaming Australian Muslims for the actions of two men at Bondi. Morrison, as usual, is way off the mark and his selective blaming is reminiscent of his ham fisted but memorable stint as our least illustrious prime minister. Maley led with Morrison\u2019s worst efforts as PM, which always make me shudder. Morrison\u2019s more memorable words since he left his non-hose holding role of many ministries have been pronounced outside this country, and only reported back to us. What was he doing in Israel? There is an adage from a master storyteller, \u201clet those without guilt cast the first stone\u201d. Morrison may have heard that one, but hasn\u2019t internalised it. Morrison may have been forgiven by some for not holding a hose, however, as the man who gave life to robo-debt, he fails to accept an ounce of culpability. Geoff Nilon, Mascot",

We had less than five hours to determine whether we wanted to vote for this bill or not, and I don't think that's good legislating. So we've been consistent all the way, we're back to with integrity and respect, and we'll continue to have those discussions with the Liberal Party, but I hope that in the near future, that there is a coalition because that's the only way to bring Anthony Albanese down.\"\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump's so-called \"Board of Peace\" will meet for the first time in two weeks.\n\nThe first meeting is scheduled for 19 February and will reportedly also serve as a fundraising conference for the reconstruction of Gaza.\n\nMany rights experts say that Mr Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory's affairs resembled a colonial structure, and they criticised the board for not including a Palestinian.\n\nSecretary-general of the League of Arab States, Ahmed Aboul-Gheit, says he's hopeful that Palestinians can govern themselves.\n\n\"I hope for a continuous rebuilding of the cities that have been demolished and destroyed beyond recognition, and I hope that the Palestinian Authority would be allowed to emerge back in Gaza, aiming at the establishment of a Palestinian state ruled by the Palestinians themselves.\"\n\nPolling has opened in Japan, where Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is hopeful the election will allow her to push new conservative policies.\n\nPolls predict the election will hand Ms Takaichi's ruling coalition a resounding win, though record snowfall in parts of the country could keep many voters at home.\n\nOpinion polls suggest the conservative coalition, led by Japan's first female prime minister, could win more than 300 of the 465 seats in the lower house of Parliament.\n\nAhead of the vote, some residents say they fear the direction Japan is heading.\n\n\u201cI feel Japan may have drifted too far to the right. I also want Japan to be protected, but things seem to be moving towards an extreme direction, that scares me.\"\n\nSnowboarder Valentino Guseli has fallen short in his unexpected bid for Australia\u2019s first medal at the Winter Olympics in Italy.\n\nThe 20-year-old reached the final of the men\u2019s big air event \u2014 a single jump off a huge ramp \u2014 but couldn\u2019t land two of his jumps, finishing 10th.\n\nJapan\u2019s Kira Kimura claimed gold ahead of compatriot Ryoma Kimata, with China\u2019s defending champion Su Yiming taking bronze.\n\nIn other results, Alex Ferlazzo sits 20th after the first round of the men\u2019s luge, while Rosie Fordham was Australia\u2019s best in the women\u2019s skiathlon, finishing 49th.",

We are stronger. Differences have been resolved,\" she said.\n\n\"We're squarely focused on representing the Australian people and fighting for their needs, their aspirations and their hopes.

But when it matters, we've got to be able to say to the Australian people what we stand for.\n\n\"And that's the maturity and leadership that I thank Susan for, that we've been able to say we've got to find a better way forward.\"\n\nThe reunification comes during a seismic shift in Australia's right-wing political landscape, with minor-party One Nation surging past the former Coalition partners in some polls.\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting from the Australian Associated Press.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "Health experts are concerned about the rise of measles in Australia, with 22 cases already reported this year, mirroring a global increase in the spread of the viral disease.\n\nAcross Australia, Queensland accounts for eight of those cases, while seven are in NSW, five in Victoria and one each in Western Australia and South Australia, according to Australian Centre for Disease Control (CDC) data as of 6 February.\n\nHealth authorities in Victoria noted in early February that a recent increase in measles cases was linked to overseas travel and warned that outbreaks of the highly contagious disease had been reported in popular Australian travel destinations, including Indonesia, Thailand and India.\n\nIndonesia, which became Australia's favourite international travel destination in 2023, had the highest number of cases between June and November 2025, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nTwo experts SBS News spoke to said increased international travel following the end of COVID-19 restrictions was partly behind rising measles infection rates in Australia.\n\nThey also cited vaccine scepticism, and an underestimation of how serious and contagious measles can be, as factors.\n\nMeasles can spread through air conditioning\n\nInfectious disease physician and clinical microbiologist Paul Griffin said some Australians underestimate the danger measles can pose to health.\n\n\"About one in 1,000 to one in 10,000 cases will lead to severe complications. And that could be a nasty pneumonia, for example, or could be brain inflammation and swelling that can lead to death or permanent disability,\" he said.\n\nHe also highlighted the extreme contagiousness of the disease.\n\n\"It's so infectious that you can be in an exposure site after someone with measles was there, even up to a few hours afterwards, and still get infected.\n\n\"It's one of these infections that can travel through air conditioning circuits, and we can see people be infected in other rooms if they're on the same circuit ... So it's spread very easily via the airborne route.\"\n\nChair of child and young person's health at the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) Dr Tim Jones agreed, telling SBS News: \"It spreads like wildfire. It's orders of magnitude more contagious than COVID was.\"\n\nUp to nine out of 10 people who don't have immunity will become infected after exposure to an infected person, according to the CDC.\n\nVaccine hesitancy and misinformation\n\nThe CDC also advises that two measles vaccinations are 99 per cent effective at preventing measles infection.\n\nHowever, Australian vaccination rates, particularly among children, have decreased in recent years.\n\nAccording to recent Department of Health data, around 93 per cent of five-year-olds have had all vaccines recommended for their age, while around 89.5 per cent of two-year-olds are fully vaccinated.\n\nThe department warned that, over the last three years, the nation's vaccination rate has dropped below its aspirational target of 95 per cent, which it says is needed to reach the \"herd immunity\" required to stop the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles.\n\nThe Australian Medical Association issued a call in December last year for \"immediate action to combat vaccine hesitancy and reverse declining immunisation rates across the country\". Source: Getty / Halfpoint Images\n\nBoth experts interviewed by SBS News pointed to vaccine hesitation as driving the increased spread of measles, with Griffin saying it was \"getting harder to convince people to make the right decision and get the vaccine\".\n\nJones said the years of COVID-19 restrictions and mandates had induced a hesitation about vaccination in some Australians.\n\n\"Families are just burnt out after COVID. They were tired of the constantly changing advice that was given on vaccination. So they're sceptical about whether the [measles] vaccination truly is as important as we say it is.\"\n\nJones said that, in his experience as a doctor, sitting down with families and discussing the risks associated with the disease changed most people's minds.\n\n\"What I find I need to do as a clinician for those families is to put what was happening in COVID in context \u2014 that things were changing very, very quickly \u2014 versus something like measles, where it's a disease that's been around for a very long time.\n\n\"We know it very well, and the vaccinations that we've been using have also been around for a long time, and we know what they are.\"\n\nMajor outbreak to elimination to a tripling of cases\n\nIn 1994, Australia faced a major measles outbreak with 4,794 confirmed cases. It was that year that the two-dose vaccination schedule was introduced for children aged between 10 and 16 years old.\n\nAt first, vaccination rates were low, but by 2000 they were sufficient to reduce the circulation of the virus, according to the Communicable Diseases Network Australia.\n\nThe two-dose vaccine offers 99 per cent protection against illness and serious complications, according to the CDC\n\nMeasles often comes with flu-like symptoms \u2014 such as a fever and runny nose \u2014 but it's important to also look out for a rash, cough and conjunctivitis, which are tell-tale signs of measles.\n\nThe National Immunisation Program now includes two doses of the measles vaccine for children aged 12 and 18 months. Source: AAP\n\nSince 1994, most Australians have received their vaccination as part of the National Immunisation Program (NIP).\n\nIn 2014, measles was declared eliminated in Australia by WHO due to the endemic measle strain not circulating for several years \u2014 thanks to the effectiveness of the vaccine.\n\nHowever, cases continue to occur in Australia, mostly in those who have travelled overseas.\n\n\"What we need to recognise is that what's kept those numbers down is consistently keeping the measles vaccination rate in Australia over 95 per cent of our population. And that's a number that's been steadily slipping over the last few years,\" Jones said.\n\n\"We've seen a tripling of measles cases in Australia over the last year ... I do think there needs to be some, at least a mild degree of, concern about what's going on.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

But the trend, known as 'Chinamaxxing', has sparked mixed responses from those of Chinese heritage.\n\nSome of the videos feature people of non-Asian backgrounds embracing Chinese food customs, such as drinking soup for breakfast, and adopting Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practices, with creators proclaiming, \"You met me at a very Chinese time of my life\".\n\nOne TikTok video of a young man eating steamed buns has been viewed 1.4 million times since being posted in October.\n\nChinese Australian content creator Vanessa Li says she found the trend interesting when she first saw it, and initially thought it was cool that people were embracing Chinese culture, but now she has mixed feelings about it.\n\nI'm seeing Chinese culture be reduced to very consumable aesthetics such as wearing slippers or the Tang jacket, or going to yum cha.\n\n\"I [also] wonder if it's something that people are adopting because, right now, it's trendy and therefore it's cool ... [and] it's going to get you [social media] engagement.\"\n\nHow did being Chinese become cool?\n\nSome of the content appears to have been inspired by a line in the 1999 movie Fight Club, where the protagonist says: \"You met me at a very strange time in my life\", which creators have appropriated to \"a very Chinese time\".\n\nDr Jennifer Beckett, a senior lecturer in media and communications at the University of Melbourne, says the videos became a trend in late 2025.\n\n\"It was bubbling away slightly in the background in mid-2025 and then it just really takes off.\"\n\nMore recently comedian Jimmy O Yang posted a TikTok video referencing the catchphrase while wearing a traditional Tang-inspired jacket released as part of Adidas' Chinese New Year collection designed by Canadian-born Hong Kong performer and designer Edison Chen.\n\nSome Chinese influencers are also hopping on the trend, providing tips to followers on how to be a \"Chinese baddie\". Other videos talk about 'Chinamaxxing' \u2014 essentially wanting to maximise Chinese attributes.\n\nDr Fan Yang, a research fellow on digital technologies at the University of Melbourne, says she first noticed the trend on Xiaohongshu, the Chinese lifestyle app (also known as RedNote), which became popular with Americans last year ahead of a threatened US ban of TikTok.\n\nYang recalls seeing a British vlogger putting goji berries into her tea and talking about how good it was.\n\n\"This is interesting because on the Chinese internet, on RedNote, we've seen people embracing so-called Western culture [and the fact that] it is not good to drink hot water anymore because the hot water [burns] your throat.\"\n\nWhat's driving the trend?\n\nBeckett says although the \"Chinese time in my life\" videos started in America, and the trend remains predominantly US-based, social media users in countries such as Australia are seeing it because of the dominance of US-based content on platforms such as Instagram and TikTok.\n\nShe believes the current state of US politics and global instability is playing a part in the rise of Chinamaxxing.\n\nPeople appear to be drawn to a sense of community amid the ramping up of the US government's rhetoric about \"who belongs and who doesn't belong\", Becketts says.\n\n\"[It's] almost like nostalgia for a Western idea of what collectivism and community looks like,\" she says, adding that it's something they feel they are missing.\n\nThere is something really nostalgic about looking at a collectivist culture like China.\n\nAnother factor that may be driving the trend is the uptick in wellness culture, and the move away from Western medicine.\n\nThis could also be in part linked to the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement led by Robert F Kennedy Jr, which emphasises reducing ultra-processed foods, removing food dyes and reviewing vaccine safety, she says. The movement has been met with backlash from public health officials over its promotion of anti-vaccine sentiment and unsubstantiated medical claims.\n\n\"There's also an element of it [Chinamaxxing] which is really about slowing down and responding to the [seasons], and sort-of anti-tech.\"\n\nThe embrace of wellness trends in the United States may have influenced people to try traditional Chinese ways of living. Source: Getty / d3sign\n\nCultural exchange increasing on social media\n\nThe third aspect influencing the trend may be the cultural dialogue fostered on Xiaohongshu, which has changed following an influx of Americans who joined the platform last year.\n\n\"[The rush of Americans onto the platform] saw a lot more cultural exchange between young Westerners and young Chinese people,\" Becketts says.\n\n\"Xiaohongshu \u2014 which had until then been a completely Chinese language platform \u2014 is now suddenly a dual language platform, and the cultural exchange that [has been] going on there [is] fascinating.\n\nThere was a lot of breaking down of stereotypes on both sides.\n\nYang agrees RedNote has facilitated cultural exchange between Chinese people and the rest of the world, and this is also partly due to how easy it is to get an account.\n\nUnlike other popular Chinese platforms, such as WeChat and Weibo, which require a Chinese national ID to verify an account, RedNote only asks for a valid mobile phone number.\n\nTikTok refugees flocked to RedNote in January 2025 ahead of a threatened TikTok ban in the US. Source: AAP / CFOTO/Sipa USA\n\nChinese culture is being more widely distributed\n\nAnother type of content that could be influencing the Chinamaxxing trend are videos created by foreigners living in China; or videos showing quirky aspects of life, such as people as rapping while cooking, or doing tai chi.\n\nThese videos can encourage interest in the culture and are often redistributed outside of China by intermediaries \u2014 such as Chinese-based agencies managing vloggers.\n\nYang notes it's suspected that some intermediaries in China disseminate content showing the country in a positive light because they're paid by the government to do so.\n\nChina has also made it easier to travel to the country, with visa-free travel for Australia and many other European countries introduced in 2024.\n\nSo in this way the nation opens the door and gives foreigners access to make posts about the country, to understand the country, and to give foreigners opportunities to explore the country and culture as well.\n\nMore generally, Yang says people are seeing images and videos about China's rapidly evolving infrastructure and technological advancements \u2014 particularly via innovations in AI and electric vehicles, which are now competitive with those coming out of the US.\n\nREAD MORE What is DeepSeek? The AI company overtaking ChatGPT\n\nThe Trump effect and 90s nostalgia\n\nThe framing of China's regime as authoritarian and America's as democratic may also be shifting amid recent coverage of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in America.\n\nYang points to the sarcastic nickname \"Chuan Jianguo\" often used by Chinese netizens for US President Donald Trump, which translates to \"Trump the Nation Builder\".\n\nIt's a phrase that suggests Trump's policies \u2014 such as his trade war and treatment of allies \u2014 is actually helping China, and could be encouraging people to rethink their views of the country.\n\nYang says these complex issues could also be driving the Chinamaxxing trend.\n\nChinese netizens have started calling US President Donald Trump \"Chuan Jianguo\", a sarcastic nickname translated as \"Trump the Nation Builder\". Source: AAP / Shawn Thew/Consolidated News Photos/Sipa USA\n\nAesthetically the world is also embracing 90s nostalgia, Beckett notes, an era that saw fashion imbued with Chinese influences, including the wearing of traditional dresses such as the cheongsam (also called a qipao), and the study of Chinese medicine being brought into Australian universities.\n\n\"There's a distinct possibility that this is also part of a more generalised 90s nostalgia being picked up [on social media], hitting this particularly restless time in US politics and global politics, hitting this uptick in wellness trends \u2014 and it's just created a perfect storm,\" Beckett says.\n\n\"I think [we need to] watch where the trend goes. Look to see who's taking it forward and where it's going, and whether or not those people are people we should be concerned about.\"\n\nGeri Halliwell (right, with Nelson Mandela) embraced the Chinese traditional dress, the cheongsam, during her time in the Spice Girls in the 1990s. Source: Getty / John Stillwell/PA Images\n\nIs the Chinamaxxing trend positive?\n\nYang says so far, the trend of embracing aspects of the Chinese lifestyle is positive but she is concerned that it could also perpetuate stereotypes.\n\n\"Not every single Chinese person drinks hot water,\" she says.\n\nBut she is hoping the trend could also help to debunk myths around Asian food, including the use of MSG, which has long-been been stigmatised and labelled as unhealthy.\n\n\"Asian food is healthy, it's healthier than some foods like McDonald's because it is less processed \u2014 it's just more ingredients and more flavourful, it doesn't mean that it's not healthy,\" Yang says.\n\nOne part of the positive development is about accepting China's culture rather than opposing a culture that one doesn't know. [It's] about being willing to understand the culture rather than being afraid.\n\nYang says if it helps people to distinguish between Chinese culture and China's political system, that could also be a welcome development.\n\nTraditional Chinese soups often include goji berries and other herbs considered to be healthy. Source: Getty / South China Morning Post\n\nBut the intention of the content is very important.\n\n\"Are [these bloggers] trying to be part of the Chinese culture to be funny \u2014 which is also racism \u2014 or are they genuinely interested in learning more about the country [and culture]?\n\n\"They have to be catchy in order to get clicks, but catchy videos can also apply some kind of mockery, stigma, stereotypes or even new stereotypes.\n\n\"The negative side ... would be taking the culture at face value [saying] I want to be like this just because it's trendy, without knowing why.\"\n\nWhen being Chinese becomes a vibe\n\nPart of the reason why Li has mixed feelings about the trend is because of her experiences growing up.\n\nShe was teased about the food in her lunchbox, and more recently, points to the racism Chinese people suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"I spent most of my teenage years trying not to be Chinese, I dyed my hair blonde, I only spoke English, and I really tried to remove myself from my culture.\"\n\nWhile it feels validating to see aspects of her culture that were previously ridiculed and othered being embraced, she's concerned about Chinese culture being reduced to a \"vibe and a trend\".\n\n\"It's kind of neglecting the fact that it's this whole value system and it's a lifestyle, and it's thousands of years of history and culture and traditions,\" Li says.\n\nWhen culture becomes a trend ... it becomes disposable, and given the nature of social media, the trends cycle so quickly.\n\n\"I worry that in a year's time, or even a few months' time ... will Chinese culture just be another thing that people thought was cool once and then discarded because it's not relevant anymore?\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "Puerto Rican musician Bad Bunny will perform at the United States' most-watched concert this weekend \u2014 the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show \u2014 fresh off Grammy Awards success for his latest album, Deb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos.\n\nThe album, described as a \"love letter to Puerto Rico\", became the first Spanish-language work to win the Grammy's top prize, Album of the Year, as well as Best M\u00fasica Urbana Album. The album's fifth single, EoO, won Best Global Music Performance.\n\nIn his acceptance speech for Album of the Year, mostly delivered in Spanish, the rapper born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio dedicated the award to migrants.\n\n\"I want to dedicate this award to all the people who had to leave their homeland, their country, to follow their dreams,\" he said.\n\nThe 31-year-old artist, who was born and lives in Puerto Rico, has been outspoken on issues of colonisation, identity, and immigration.\n\nIn Deb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos \u2014 which translates to \"I should have taken more photos\" \u2014 Bad Bunny addresses Puerto Rican identity, the ongoing effects of colonisation, and the displacement of residents on the island, which is an unincorporated territory of the United States.\n\nHe used his Grammy acceptance speech for Best M\u00fasica Urbana Album \u2014 awarded for Latin performers showcasing Latin urban styles \u2014 to criticise the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.\n\n\"Before I say thanks to God, I'm gonna say ICE out,\" he said, to fervent applause.\n\n\"We are not savages, we are not animals, we are not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans.\"\n\nHis protest at the event mirrored the pro-immigration and anti-ICE sentiment of other winners, including Olivia Dean and Billie Eilish.\n\nICE agents have been deployed in several cities since President Donald Trump took office last year to carry out the administration's mass deportation of suspected illegal immigrants.\n\nTwo civilians were shot and killed by ICE agents in Minnesota last month, triggering mass protests in cities across the country.\n\nHistory-making concert\n\nThe Super Bowl is America\u2019s most-viewed television broadcast. A record 127.7 million Americans tuned in to watch the 2025 game, eclipsing the estimated 123 million viewership a year earlier.\n\nOn Sunday, Bad Bunny will make history as the first Latino and Spanish-speaking solo headliner at the Super Bowl. The halftime concert, now in its 60th iteration, has previously featured artists including Beyonc\u00e9, Prince, Rhianna and The Rolling Stones.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Thursday, Bad Bunny remained tight-lipped about his plans for the 13-minute performance, but said he wanted people to have fun.\n\n\"I want to bring to the stage, of course, a lot of my culture,\" he said.\n\n\"I really want people to have fun. It\u2019s gonna be a huge party.\"\n\nBad Bunny began releasing music on SoundCloud in 2016 and has since risen to become one of the world's most-streamed artists.\n\nSinging in Puerto Rican Spanish about Latino and Puerto Rican pride, his music is often categorised as Latin trap, with influences of reggaeton \u2014 a popular Caribbean genre with roots in Jamaican dancehall \u2014 American hip-hop, and southern US trap music.\n\nWhen a verse on Cardi B\u2019s 2018 hit I Like It pushed him into the mainstream, Bad Bunny already had more than a dozen top-40 hits on the US Latin charts.\n\nHis third album, 2020's El \u00daltimo Tour del Mundo \u2014 meaning The Last World Tour \u2014 became the first Billboard number one recorded entirely in Spanish.\n\nHe was the most-played artist on Spotify from 2020 to 2022 and again in 2025, with nearly 20 billion streams.\n\nHe will tour Australia later this month, with two shows at Sydney's ENGIE Stadium on 28 February and 1 March.\n\nBad Bunny said he was excited for the Super Bowl performance.\n\n\"I grew up watching sport, playing sport, very bad,\" he laughed.\n\n\"But I do love sport. It's actually one of my favourite combinations, sport with music.\"\n\nTrump not attending\n\nTrump said he will not attend the game, telling the New York Post in January that the venue location in Santa Clara, California, was \"too far away\".\n\nAsked about the lineup, with American punk band Green Day opening the event, Trump said he was \"anti-them\".\n\n\"I think it's a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,\" he said.\n\nLISTEN TO Bad Bunny prepares for Super Bowl halftime performance SBS News 01:02 English\n\nDuring his world tour last year, Bad Bunny did not play on the US mainland, saying he feared his fans would be targeted by ICE.\n\n\"There was the issue of, like, f\u2014k ICE could be outside [the concert],\" he told i-D Magazine in September. \"And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about.\"\n\nHe instead opted for a three-month residency in San Juan, Puerto Rico, which was estimated to generate $200 million for the local economy. Tickets were reserved nearly exclusively for locals over the 31-show run.\n\nWho is playing at the Super Bowl?\n\nThe New England Patriots will face the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe two teams competed at the 2015 Super Bowl, which the Patriots won.\n\nThe Patriots have won six Super Bowl titles, in 2002, 2004, 2005, 2015, 2017, and 2019. The Seahawks won in 2014 against the Denver Broncos.\n\nWhen is the game?\n\nThe Super Bowl will screen in the US on Sunday at 3:30pm local time which is Monday morning in Australia.\n\nThe game will be at 10:30am on Monday in NSW, the ACT, Victoria, and Tasmania, 10am in South Australia, 9.30am in Queensland and 7.30am in Western Australia.\n\nThe Super Bowl will be available to watch free-to-air on Channel 7, and online at 7plus.\n\nIt will be broadcast on Disney+, Foxtel's ESPN channel, or KAYO.\n\nThe halftime show, which usually runs for 12 to 15 minutes, is during the halftime break.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "The average wage in Australia is $1,611.10 a week, but this figure can change dramatically depending on where you live, your sex and occupation.\n\nEmployee Earnings and Hours data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 23 January reveals which workers are the most highly paid and how wages vary by state.\n\nThe business survey was conducted in May last year and is completed every two years. The average wage figure includes people working part-time and full-time, as well as those in managerial roles.\n\nExcluding part-time workers and managerial staff \u2014 who have strategic responsibilities or oversee a significant number of employees \u2014 the survey found the average weekly wage for a full-time worker in Australia is $2,061 before tax.\n\nThe state with the highest average wage is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), where full-time workers earn an average of $2,206 a week. This drops to $1,784 in Tasmania.\n\nWhen you exclude high-level managerial staff, workers in WA have the highest average wages for full-time adult employees in Australia.\n\nThe data also shows which Australian workers are earning more or less based on their industry and gender.\n\nMen employed in the mining industry are on average the highest-earning full-time workers, bringing home $3,319 a week.\n\nThe most highly paid women in the country are also those working in mining, earning an average of $2,750 a week.\n\nMen and women working in the mining industry earn on average the highest wages in Australia.\n\nThe most highly paid workers\n\nThat picture changes slightly when you look at specific occupations.\n\nThe highest-paid occupations in Australia \u2014 based on average weekly earnings for all employees \u2014 are anaesthetists, who earn $5,366 on average before tax, followed by surgeons on $4,159 and engineering managers on $3,939.\n\nAnaesthetists are the highest-paid workers in Australia based on average weekly earnings for all employees. Source: SBS News\n\nAverage wage data can be skewed by a few exceptionally high earners whose income can push the average higher. It's also important to note that these figures include part-time workers, who earn considerably less than full-time workers.\n\nThe data can also be broken down by gender, but there are some limitations to this, as it is not available for every occupation (anaesthetists are not included, for example).\n\nOf the occupations that do provide a breakdown, among women, the highest earners are engineering managers, who earn an average weekly wage of $3,818, and surgeons, who earn $3,752. They are followed by \"commissioned officers (management)\" \u2014 those employed in high-ranking positions in the defence forces, fire and police services \u2014 on $3,605.\n\nEngineering managers are the highest paid women on average. Source: Getty / chain45154\n\nAmong men, \"other medical practitioners\" takes the top spot with an average income of $4,990 a week. This is a category that includes dermatologists, emergency medicine specialists, obstetricians, gynaecologists, ophthalmologists, pathologists and radiologists.\n\nThey are followed by surgeons on $4,486, and commissioned officers (management) on $3,990.\n\nSBS News has created a searchable database, showing average wages for specific occupations. The figures include both part-time and full-time workers. Enter your occupation below to explore.\n\nGender pay gap is closing\n\nWhile average weekly earnings for different occupations appear to show a stark difference in what men and women are being paid, ABS head of labour statistics Sean Crick says comparing hourly pay is more useful when looking at the gender pay gap because women are more likely to work part-time than men.\n\nAcross all professions, men earned $50 an hour on average, while women earned $46.\n\nThe gender pay gap in May 2025 was 8.4 per cent, a 0.5 percentage point improvement on the figure two years prior, when it was 8.9 per cent.\n\nHow wages change depending on your state and age\n\nIncluding part-time workers, the ABS survey found those employed in the ACT have the highest average wage, earning $1,821 a week before tax.\n\nThose aged 45 to 54 in the ACT are the most highly paid age group in Australia, earning on average $2,456 a week, while those aged 20 years and younger in the territory are the fourth lowest earners, bringing home $497 on average.\n\nTasmania is the state or territory with the lowest average wage overall, with employees earning around $1,389 a week.\n\nBut the demographic with the lowest average wage in the country is South Australians aged 20 years and younger, who are paid around $464 per week.\n\nWorkers in the ACT are the highest paid employees in Australia. Source: SBS News\n\nNon-managerial staff exclude high-level managers with strategic responsibilities or who oversee a significant number of employees. Source: SBS News\n\nIt can also be helpful to look at median wages when seeking to understand what a typical Australian earns. The median wage is the middle value in a list of incomes ranging from lowest to highest \u2014 so half of all people earn more than that figure, and half earn less.\n\nIn Australia, the median wage is $1,436 a week \u2014 $1,674 for men and $1,250 for women. This includes both full and part-time workers.\n\nYou can find out more information about where your wages sits compared to others in the interactive below, which has been based on data from the latest ABS release on Characteristics of Employment, August 2025.\n\nInteractive design by Ken Macleod\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nA washout in the stocks of software companies has been flowing through Wall Street this week, as investors realised the threat that artificial intelligence will displace businesses had arrived. While the prospect of AI disruptions has hung over the economy for years, a new set of tools released this week by a San Francisco start-up forced a sudden reckoning on Wall Street. Anthropic\u2019s Claude app. A new set of tools released by the company last week sent tech stocks plunging. Bloomberg Software companies most at risk from the new tools were the hardest hit, as well as the investment funds that lend to these companies. But the sell-off helped push down the broader market. On Thursday, the S&P 500 turned negative for the year after falling on six of the past seven days. But it rebounded the next day, rising 1.5 per cent. AI has been like rocket fuel for stocks, driving prices to record highs in recent years. Since October, though, that exuberance has been fading, as some realities of this transformative technology have begun to sink in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot only are investors growing worried that AI could render certain businesses obsolete, they are also questioning the growing piles of money that companies are spending on AI. On Thursday, investors were spooked by Amazon\u2019s revelation that it planned to spend $US200 billion ($285 billion) on AI and other large investments this year, exceeding analysts\u2019 predictions by $US50 billion; shares fell 7 per cent on Friday. Last week, Google\u2019s parent Alphabet said it would spend as much as $US185 billion this year, and last week Meta said its capital expenses, in large part to support AI, could reach $US135 billion. In the software sector, the catalyst for the sell-off was the release on Tuesday by San Francisco-based artificial intelligence firm Anthropic of free plug-in software tools that allow companies to automate functions like customer support and legal services. Because they were created as \u201copen source\u201d software, any company can download the tools without paying for them. These plug-ins could replace the tools that companies currently sell to businesses. Another area vulnerable to AI are providers of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, a mode of delivering subscription-based computer programs over the internet instead of buying and installing them locally on one\u2019s computer. New, free software models from AI companies have the potential to replace not only the SaaS business model but also much of the workforce behind it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere have been a number of these big sell-offs of these SaaS stocks over the past few years as these software models have rolled out,\u201d Open AI CEO Sam Altman said in an interview with TBPN, a tech-focused streaming show. \u201cI expect there will be more.\u201d Editor's pick Updated\n\nWorld markets More than $60 billion wiped from ASX in market rout Analysts have taken to calling the broad sell-off the \u201cSaaSpocalypse\u201d. Shares of companies like LegalZoom, LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters, which offer legal services and research, dropped as much as 20 per cent over the past week. They had mixed recoveries after their drop. Shares of Salesforce, which produces SaaS and customer relationship management software for sales workers, have fallen 25 per cent over the past month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven companies catering to the arts have been hit. Shares in Adobe and Figma, which produce tools for artists, fell 9 per cent and 17 per cent over the past week, driven by fears that many of the bread-and-butter design tools they provide to creative workers could eventually be automated. The fervour for AI is not just affecting the software industry. The surge in AI spending has generated enormous demand for random-access memory, or RAM, a kind of chip required to produce the AI hardware built by these companies. Shares of Salesforce, which produces SaaS and customer relationship management software for sales workers, have fallen 25 per cent over the past month. Bloomberg On Wednesday, Qualcomm, which makes microprocessors for smartphones and computers that require RAM, said it faced uncertainty around how much demand it would have for its chips over the next two years. That is, in part, because the skyrocketing cost of memory could dampen consumer demand for new devices. Shares of Qualcomm are down about 20 per cent this year. Software companies have also been a favourite target of lenders of private credit, because the companies\u2019 subscription-based business model provides a stable stream of income to support taking on more debt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrivate credit deals, as the name suggests, are not public, but the loans held by related business development companies, or BDCs, are seen as a proxy for the industry. Roughly half the software debt held by BDCs, equal to about $US45 billion, comes due in 2030 or later, according to analysts at Barclays, raising worries about the length of time until these loans are repaid. The more time a borrower has to repay a loan, the more time there is for the borrower to default \u2014 or, in this case, the more time for a business to be displaced by AI. An exchange-traded fund run by VanEck that contains holdings in many of the major BDCs is down about 6 per cent this year and more than 20 per cent over the past 12 months. Even as Ares Management and Blue Owl Capital \u2014 two of the largest private-credit firms \u2014 reported results that Wall Street analysts largely applauded, the two companies couldn\u2019t escape investors\u2019 worries about AI disruption. Shares of Ares have fallen more than 20 per cent this year and Blue Owl\u2019s have fallen over 16 per cent. On an analyst call Thursday, Blue Owl CEO Marc Lipschultz denied that AI posed a threat to its lending business.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have red flags, and, point of fact, we don\u2019t have yellow flags. We actually have largely green flags,\u201d Lipschultz said. Editor's pick Opinion\n\nMergers & acquisitions Why Elon Musk just created a $1.8 trillion space monster Stephen Bartholomeusz Senior business columnist Blue Owl chief financial officer Alan Kirshenbaum attributed the company\u2019s challenges to \u201cheadwinds in private credit, AI, software\u201d, as well as investors who want some of their money back. Analysts could find little to worry about in the firm\u2019s results. \u201cIf you took the name off the top of the release and ripped through the details, you\u2019d think that\u2019s a pretty darn good quarter,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note late last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBitcoin, a retail-dominated market that tends to swing with some of the popular stock trades, also skidded, sliding as low as $US60,000, its lowest level since October 2024, before rising back towards $US70,000. On Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during a congressional hearing that the government had no power to order banks to buy bitcoin in order to stem the price decline. As investors dial down their exposure to the more speculative bets like bitcoin and AI-related stocks, they are shifting towards previously unloved sectors that are seen as better insulated through periods of volatility. So far this year, energy stocks, consumer staples and the materials sector have all gained over 10 per cent while tech has languished. \u201cAfter years of tech-driven market leadership, the balance of power is shifting as investors rotate toward traditional \u2018old economy\u2019 sectors,\u201d said Angelo Kourkafas, a strategist at fund manager Edward Jones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.

In their shows, Aunty Maria from the Philippines (McBride) and Aunty Rani from Sri Lanka (Ratnayake) ask the audience to write their problems on scraps of paper that go into a rice cooker to be plucked out at random. \u201cWe then give advice as the aunties,\u201d McBride says. \u201cIt\u2019s not always good advice,\u201d Ratnayake adds, noting the characters are drawn from life. \u201cWhen I go to Sri Lanka, aunties will ask me those annoying questions.

Ratnayake got her PhD at the University of Melbourne and is noted for developing the Flying Fox Heat Stress Forecaster as part of her CSIRO research into biosecurity. She discovered improv at a point in her life when she needed a change and was \u201csaying yes to everything\u201d. McBride left Brisbane as a teenager seeking fame in the Philippines. She was swiftly cast in films, TV productions including Tabing-Ilog (a Filipino answer to teen drama Dawson\u2019s Creek), and was co-host of a talk show, Talk TV, that was cancelled after a year. Back in Brisbane, she has produced the BrisAsia Comedy Gala for the last five years at Big Fork Theatre in the Valley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe show is transferring to the larger stage at the Brisbane Powerhouse for the first time on Saturday, February 14, with a line-up of local and interstate acts.

Run by the Brisbane City Council, BrisAsia (February 13-22) marks Lunar New Year across town with food, music, art and performances. McBride says Brisbane is a more welcoming and diverse city now than when she was growing up. \u201cThere weren\u2019t too many mixed-race kids at that time, and so me and my brother were bullied, and asked if we were Chinese or Japanese \u2013 there could just be two. \u201cNow it is more multicultural, and we embrace who we are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrisAsia Festival 2026: 10 more highlights Southside by Night\n\nCar culture fans bring their hot rods to this mix of hip hop and street food.
