(Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nThey are paid lower wages on a sliding scale which unions say is out of touch with the cost-of-living pressures confronting young workers.\n\nWorkers under 20 are paid 90 per cent of the adult award rate, while 19-year-olds are paid 80 per cent of the award rate.\n\nEmployees who are 18 get just 70 per cent of the full award rates in retail, fast food and pharmacies.\n\nACTU President Michele O'Neil said employer groups have got it wrong when they claim a change will cost young workers their jobs.\n\n\"If you're 18, you're legally an adult. You can vote. You can drive. You can work the late shift. But in retail and fast food, you're still paid like a kid,\" O'Neil said.\n\n\"That pay gap isn't small. An 18-year-old needs 50 plus hours a week to earn what an adult makes in 38.\n\n\"The bills don't get reduced because you're younger. The rent doesn't care about your birthday.\n\n\"The SDA - the union for retail and fast-food workers - has asked the Fair Work Commission to fix this.\n\n\"Once you're legally an adult, you should be paid the adult wage.

(Fiona-Lee Quimby)\n\nThe device used to cost $270 a year, but Butler claims the cost will now plummet to $31.60 per script, with concession holders being able to access the contraceptive device for as little as $7.70 per script.\n\nFor most Aussie women, this will make it two-thirds cheaper, with some being able to save up to 88 per cent.\n\nThree other pills will also be added to the scheme, as part of a wide-ranging plan to make birth control more affordable.\n\n\"Literally 300,000 women every year will save hundreds and hundreds of dollars,\" Butler told Today .\n\n\"With three new pills that hundreds of thousands of women were using because they're really highly effective and don't have side effects that some of the older medicines have.\"\n\nMark Butler discussed the changes on Today.

(AP)\n\n\u201cTheir Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD,\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform as he flew aboard Air Force One to Malaysia.\n\n\"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10 per cent over and above what they are paying now.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear what legal authority Trump would use to impose the additional import taxes.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on when the 10 per cent hike would come into effect, and whether it would apply to all Canadian goods.\n\nCanada's economy has been hit hard by Trump's tariffs, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has been trying to work with Trump to lower them.\n\nMore than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($3.9 billion AUD) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.\n\nDonald Trump Truth Social post on Canada tariffs (Truth Social)\n\nA spokesperson for Carney didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMany Canadian products have been hit with a 35 per cent tariff, while steel and aluminium face rates of 50 per cent.\n\nEnergy products have a lower rate of 10 per cent, while the vast majority of goods are covered by the U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement, and are exempt from tariffs.\n\nThat trade agreement is slated for review.

But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario's ad spelling out the case against tariffs.\n\nTrump has complained the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled for next month that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy.\n\nLower courts had ruled he had exceeded his authority.",

        "text": "ABC AFLW commentator Aaron Bryans tabled a question over the weekend on whether North Melbourne's dominance in the AFLW was lessening the enjoyment of the competition as a whole.\n\n\"The narrative around North Melbourne now is that, 'Oh, it's ruining the competition because they're too good' and I think this is a weird part of sport where we don't actually enjoy successful dynasties,\" he said during the broadcast.\n\nNorth Melbourne's AFLW winning streak Having developed the program layer by layer since joining the AFLW in 2019, North Melbourne's disciplined, professional style of footy is forcing the rest of the league to rise to their level.\n\nThe notion that the Kangaroos are all but guaranteed to take out this year's premiership \u2014 as no-one can get near them \u2014 has been raised by some fans as a potential reason some neutral or opposition supporters are losing interest at the season's pointy end.\n\nHowever, fellow commentator ABC commentator and AFLW analyst Gemma Bastiani said the club's professional standards were not only setting a new benchmark for the competition, but would push the league into a new, and better, chapter.\n\n\"I probably have the perspective that them being so dominant will seem like a big issue in the present, but in the long run, they're actually forcing the rest of the competition to rise to their level,\" Bastiani told ABC Sport.\n\n\"So we'll look back at them being a key part of growing the league.\"\n\nThe Kangaroos secured the minor premiership on Sunday after a 46-point defeat of top-eight side St Kilda.\n\nIn doing so, they equalled the VFL/AFL record for consecutive wins, held with Geelong through the 1952-53 seasons.\n\nA new attendance record was set at Arden Street Oval the weekend before for North Melbourne's game against three-time premiers Adelaide, suggesting interest was there from Kangaroo fans to watch their team do well and from those who wanted to see the top side challenged.\n\nSimilar to Bastiani, Bryans later told ABC Sport there was a tremendous amount of respect within AFLW circles for what the Kangaroos had been able to accomplish and how they were performing.\n\n\"For years there's been critiques over the league's skill level and pace \u2026 but with every win, North continue to raise the bar; setting a standard that is forcing the other 17 teams to catch up,\" Bryans said.\n\nAFLW commentators say North Melbourne's dominance will force other teams to improve. (Getty: James Wiltshire/AFL Photos)\n\nNorth Melbourne has won all 11 matches this season by 50 points or more.\n\n\"They're fast on turnover and pinpoint with their ball movement,\" Bryans said.\n\n\"It's a brand of footy that's incredibly exciting to watch.\n\n\"Yes, their winning streak puts them in the box seat for consecutive premierships but the game is so unpredictable that nothing is guaranteed, and in two weeks' time there'll be seven sides hungry to knock them off their perch.\"\n\nHe said success in sport was about more than just on-field performance, where the women's side brought home a maiden premiership last year after years of building towards it.\n\nNorth Melbourne came into the competition as an expansion side in the 2019 season, along with Geelong, and invested heavily in the women's program.\n\nThe Kangaroos VFLW side won its second premiership in a row this year.\n\nNorth Melbourne has secured the AFLW minor premiership. (Getty: Quinn Rooney)\n\n\"As an original expansion side, North not only had to build its list over seven years but overcome the mental challenge of constantly being a step behind the big three of Adelaide, Brisbane and Melbourne,\" Bryans said.\n\n\"Their dominance is the culmination of years of hardship and should be celebrated.\n\n\"Historic dynasties usually start with a lot of neutral fanfare but often succumb to tall poppy syndrome when the reality is we're currently witnessing a run that may never be repeated and that's a privilege, not a punishment.\"\n\nNorth Melbourne play second-placed Hawthorn in the final home and away round on Friday night in Frankston.",

Honestly, just sharing the pool with her in this era of distance swimming is absolutely incredible.\"\n\nLedecky had held the short-course 800m freestyle world record \u2014 7 minutes 57.42 seconds \u2014 since 2022.\n\nBut Pallister clipped more than 3 seconds from that mark, clocking 7:54.00.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nPallister said it was an honour merely to be mentioned alongside Ledecky, who boasts an unrivalled medal collection: nine gold among 14 Olympic medals, and 23 gold among 30 world championship medals.\n\n\"To be someone that's in a conversation with her and challenging those times is really, really incredible,\" the Australian said.\n\n\"I'm very fortunate for the people that support me and my network that have allowed me to get to this position.\"\n\nThat support network includes teammate and four-time Olympic gold medallist Kaylee McKeown, who twice lowered her own short-course world record in the 200m backstroke at World Cup meets in the past week.\n\n\"I could see the determination in Lani's eyes when she was doing a pre-activation and I knew she was going to do something special,\" McKeown said.\n\n\"It has been a long time coming for her.\"\n\nPallister, the daughter of Olympic swimmer Janelle and god-daughter of Australian swim great Dawn Fraser, was always a precocious talent.\n\nDo you have a story idea about women in sport?

        "text": "Booking through travel agencies can be a way of snagging the best deals on flights.\n\nBut what happens when those flights get cancelled or rescheduled? Can you expect a refund? And will it come from the airline or the agency?\n\nAs some of our readers share their experiences we asked experts for their take.\n\nLet's unpack.\n\nLeft in the lurch\n\nBrisbane resident Ahmed Hussain was due for a visit back home to Pakistan in May.\n\nBut unrest in the country unfolded just a week before his departure date, leaving him unsure if it was still safe to travel.\n\nAhmed Hussain was disappointed with the lack of updates from his travel agency. (Supplied)\n\nWhile friends and family had flights cancelled or changed, there were no updates from his travel agent.\n\n\"I did not even know if my flight had been rescheduled or had been cancelled. I had to keep calling them to find out,\" Mr Hussain says.\n\nAfter several exchanges during the week, his travel agent confirmed the flight had been cancelled and he could expect a 35 per cent refund, as per their policy.\n\nBut the payment didn't arrive, despite Mr Hussain regularly chasing them up.\n\nFour months in and he's only received half the amount.\n\n\"I'm still calling them every week,\" Mr Hussain says.\n\nWhen can you get a refund?\n\nYou'll be protected by Australian consumer law when your flight is:\n\nwithin Australia\n\nleaving Australia\n\nbooked through an Australian website.\n\nUnder these rules, automatic consumer guarantees apply, including that airlines are required to provide you with services within a reasonable time frame.\n\nHowever, whether an airline has failed to meet these guarantees will depend on the circumstances.\n\nIn particular, airlines will look at whether the flight delay or cancellation was within their control \u2014 such as a \"mechanical fault or crew rostering issue\", explains Canstar's data insights director Sally Tindall.\n\n\"For example, Qantas' policy states that weather events, air traffic control issues and security issues are not within their control.\"\n\nIn the event of a flight delay, Ms Tindall says other forms of compensation such as refunds for meals and accommodation costs may also be included.\n\n\"For example, Virgin Australia's policy states that travellers who are away from their home city might be entitled to accommodation and meals if their flight is delayed overnight,\" she says.\n\n\"But the amount of compensation is capped, so it's worth knowing exactly what this is.\n\n\" It's important to understand that airlines do not guarantee flight times so often it will come down to what constitutes a reasonable time frame. \"\n\nSally Tindall wants consumers to know their rights for reimbursements from airlines. (Supplied: Canstar)\n\nThe airline's compensation policy should outline the different levels of reimbursement offered for various scenarios.\n\nThe general rule of thumb is you're less likely to get a refund if you cancel, change, or miss a flight on your own accord.\n\nHowever, if you had purchased a flexible ticket or travel insurance, changes or cancellations might be covered subject to the company or insurer's policy.\n\nAre flight credits an option?\n\nThe short answer is yes.\n\nAn ACCC spokesperson says where airlines fail to meet consumer guarantees, passengers should be entitled to \"a replacement service, credit or refund, depending on the facts involved\".\n\nIn case of a cancellation, you should get to choose how you would like to be reimbursed, Ms Tindall says.\n\nHere are some things Australian Travel Industry Association (ATIA) CEO Dean Long wants people to keep in mind if they opt for flight credits:\n\nensure credit offers are provided in writing and include all relevant terms\n\nkeep a clear record of the value of your credits and any restrictions on how they can be used\n\ncheck when your travel credits expire. It is your responsibility to use credit within the expiry period\n\nif you are unsure of the balance or status of your credits, ask your agent for written confirmation \u2014 your agent can liaise with the airline to clarify any queries you may have.\n\n\"We typically find that travel credits are provided to the value you purchased the flight ticket for,\" Mr Long added.\n\nGoing around in circles\n\nAdelaide resident Robert Dinnen had gone with a Czech-based travel agency for an elaborate trip around Europe.\n\nMr Dinnen went with a European company assuming they would know the best local flights and travel routes to take. (Supplied)\n\nThen COVID struck and the overseas travel ban fell in place.\n\nBecause he had paid using a credit card he tried contacting his bank to retract the payment of $2,000 for flights.\n\nHe said they had told him: \"There was no way to charge back because they said it was an internal dispute process with the travel agency.\"\n\nSo he went on to repeatedly contact his travel agent for a refund and, each time, they said they were waiting on the carriers to issue one.\n\nMr Dinnen was told to check with his airlines for a refund on flight tickets. (Supplied: Robert Dinnen)\n\nThis went on for about five months before Mr Dinnen decided to check in directly with four airline providers to get more information on the status of his refund.\n\n\"I spoke to the carrier who said everything's been refunded, and then I got a $100 payment,\" he says.\n\nThe amount was final.\n\nOut of the four carriers Mr Dinnen had booked with only one issued a refund. (Supplied)\n\n\"Nothing was ever forwarded to me. [The travel agency] didn't say what the $100 was for, if it was a component or a partial refund,\" Mr Dinnen says.\n\n\"It was just a random amount.\"\n\nMr Dinnen checked the company's online reviews and found that many others had similar experiences.\n\nWho is responsible for issuing a refund?\n\nWhen you go through a travel agent or an online booking platform the terms and conditions of both the airline and intermediary will apply to their booking, according to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).\n\nHowever, ATIA's Dean Long says airline policies and fare rules takes precedence.\n\n\"An agent cannot provide more than what the airline or supplier offers,\" he says.\n\nUltimately, who you paid is who will issue your refund.\n\nTravel agencies will act on the customer's behalf, confirm whether you're eligible for a refund, facilitate the process with the airline and get the money flowing back to you, Mr Long explains.\n\nDean Long encourages people to book with local businesses for better consumer protection. (Supplied: Australian Federation of Travel Agents)\n\n\"Your agent is there to manage the process, but the actual refund comes from the supplier,\" he says.\n\n\"It's going to be far more challenging if you're using an offshore online travel agent because it's hard to enforce Australian Consumer Law.\n\n\"If the deal is too good to be true, and you've never heard of the website, and they're not an Australian business, you've really got to be asking yourself where are you putting your credit card?\"\n\nHow long should a refund take to come back to you?\n\nIt can stretch up to 14 days once a settlement is reached, Mr Long says.\n\nDepending on where you are on the settlement cycle it can be shorter where the average, Mr Long says, is \"between five to seven days\".\n\nCan travel insurance protect you?\n\nIf you've taken out travel insurance you may be able to claim back money from the insurer for flight changes or cancellations the airline won't refund, says Canstar's Sally Tindall.\n\nWhat happens if you're left stranded overseas after a natural disaster? One family's story In an experience Ms Draper describes as \"disempowering\", the lack of communication from her airline had left her logistically challenged and financially drained.\n\nAs an example, if you have a medical emergency before flying the airline won't refund you but your costs might be covered by your insurer, depending on the policy.\n\nHowever, the insurer may ask you to pursue a refund or replacement service from the airline first.\n\nAnother benefit is having \"a higher chance of getting cash back and not just credits,\" Mr Long adds.\n\nHowever, each policy will have inclusions and exclusions that determine what is covered.\n\nExamples of common exclusions from travel insurance policies include:\n\nelective surgeries overseas\n\npregnancy past a certain point\n\ntravel to \"do not travel\" destinations\n\nacts of war or terrorism\n\nillegal activities\n\nany incidents the occur while you're under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n\nWhere can you seek extra help from?\n\nHere are some steps experts suggest you can take.\n\nFirstly, contact your travel or booking agent to request a remedy.\n\nBut if you have read the terms and conditions in your booking and still disagree with your travel agent's compensation outcome, you can take these steps:\n\ncontact your local consumer protection agency for assistance\n\nmake a claim with your local small claims court or tribunal\n\nreport to ACCC if you believe that a travel provider is misrepresenting your right to a remedy for cancelled flights.\n\nSecondly, contact your travel insurance provider to find out your eligibility for a refund if you bought insurance with a separate provider.\n\nAnd if you would like to dispute the decision, here's what you can do:\n\nlodge a formal complaint internally through your insurer's grievance process\n\nescalate the matter to the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) if the outcome remains unsatisfactory.\n\nLastly, for better consumer protection, booking with ATIA-accredited businesses will give you access to a free mediation process with ATIA.\n\nTo support this joint initiative with Consumer Federation Australia and Choice, the ATIA's Complaints Appeal Committee (ACAC) has been appointed as the independent review body to make final decisions on any follow-up appeals to the mediation outcome.\n\nDoes travel insurance cover cancellations due to war or natural disasters? We spoke to the experts to find out exactly what you're entitled to when a conflict breaks or a natural disaster unfolds.\n\nAlternatively, you can escalate through civil tribunals if the outcome is unsatisfactory.\n\nMr Long says \"ultimately you need to find someone, whoever that may be, that gives you the value you're after\".",

        "text": "The US Department of Agriculture has posted a notice on its website saying federal food aid will not go out from November 1, raising the stakes for families nationwide as the government shutdown drags on.\n\nThe notice comes after the Trump administration said it would not tap roughly $5 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP, flowing into November.\n\nThe program helps about one in eight Americans buy groceries.\n\n\"Bottom line, the well has run dry,\" the USDA notice says.\n\n\"At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 1. We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.\"\n\nThe shutdown, which began on October 1, is the second-longest on record.\n\nWhile the Republican administration took steps leading up to the shutdown to ensure SNAP benefits were paid this month, the cut-off would expand the impact of the impasse to a wider swath of Americans \u2014 and some of those most in need \u2014 unless a political resolution is found in a few days.\n\nThe administration blames Democrats, who say they will not agree to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate with them on extending expiring subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans say Democrats must first agree to reopen the government before negotiation.\n\nWhat the history of US government shutdowns tells us While shutdowns have been a possibility since 1976, when Congress introduced the modern budget process, they've been a relatively rare occurrence. Here's a look at how previous shutdowns have played out.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers have written to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins requesting to use contingency funds to cover the bulk of next month's benefits.\n\nBut a USDA memo that surfaced on Friday says \"contingency funds are not legally available to cover regular benefits\". The document says the money is reserved for things such as helping people in disaster areas.\n\nIt cited a storm named Melissa, which has strengthened into a major hurricane, as an example of why it is important to have the money available to mobilise quickly in the event of a disaster.\n\nThe prospect of families not receiving food aid has deeply concerned states run by both parties.\n\nSome states have pledged to keep SNAP benefits flowing even if the federal program halts payments, but there are questions about whether the US government directives may allow that to happen. The USDA memo also says states would not be reimbursed for temporarily picking up the cost.\n\nOther states are telling SNAP recipients to be ready for the benefits to stop. Arkansas and Oklahoma, for example, are advising recipients to identify food pantries and other groups that help with food.\n\nUS Senator Chris Murphy, D-Conn, accused Republicans and Trump of not agreeing to negotiate.\n\n\"The reality is, if they sat down to try to negotiate, we could probably come up with something pretty quickly,\" Murphy said Sunday on CNN's State of the Union.\n\n\"We could open up the government on Tuesday or Wednesday, and there wouldn't be any crisis in the food stamp program.\"\n\nAP",

        "text": "A terrifying moment has been captured on camera when two track marshals ran in front of a car during Formula 1's Mexico City Grand Prix.\n\nNew Zealand racer Liam Lawson was at the back of the field and approaching a chicane during Monday's race while two marshals were running on the circuit itself.\n\nThe Racing Bulls driver slowed down to ensure he did not strike either of the two in a frightening moment captured on his onboard camera.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" Lawson said on his team radio.\n\n\"Oh my God.\n\n\"I could have f***ing killed them, mate.\"\n\nThe marshals appeared to be collecting debris off the track after a chaotic start to the race won by McLaren's Lando Norris.\n\nLawson had come in for a pit stop in the opening laps to replace a damaged front wing. He came out of the pits and took the first turn, only to be confronted by the duo on the circuit.\n\n\"I honestly couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing,\" Lawson told media.\n\n\"Boxed [pitted], came out on a new set of hards [tyres], and then I got to turn one and there were just two dudes running across the track.\n\n\"I nearly hit one of them. Honestly, it was so dangerous.\n\n\"Obviously, there\u2019s been a miscommunication somewhere but I\u2019ve never experienced that before, and I haven\u2019t really seen that in the past. It\u2019s pretty unacceptable.\n\n\"We can\u2019t understand how on a live track marshals can be allowed to just run across the track like that. I have no idea why, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get some sort of explanation, but it really can\u2019t happen again.\"\n\nThe international governing body, the International Automobile Federation (FIA), released a statement that said an investigation would take place.\n\n\"Following a turn one incident, race control was informed that debris was present on the track at the apex of that corner,\" the FIA statement read.\n\n\"On lap three, marshals were alerted and placed on standby to enter the track and recover the debris once all cars had passed.\n\n\"As soon as it became apparent that Lawson had pitted, the instructions to dispatch marshals were rescinded and a double yellow flag was shown in that area. We are still investigating what occurred after that point.\"\n\nF1 has taken a strong stance on safety in recent years following the death of Jules Bianchi who succumbed to injuries sustained after hitting a rescue vehicle that was collecting a stricken car inside the barriers during the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix.\n\nThere was a similarly scary moment in Japan in 2022 when Pierre Gasly raced past a tractor on the track in low visibility.",

        "text": "An Adelaide mum says drug contamination at the public housing property she recently moved into has forced her to resort to \"squatting\" at her old home because she does not want to put her son and herself in further danger, with the state government confirming a review into the case is now underway.\n\nThe tenant, Lauren, who asked for her last name not to be used, said she and her son had become ill almost immediately after moving into an SA Housing Trust property at West Beach.\n\nShe said she and her son, whom she said had complex needs, experienced symptoms including wheezing, dry-retching and burning in the throat after moving in on October 2.\n\nShe said that she later had to call an ambulance, and that ambulance officers had listed the case as one of \"chemical exposure\".\n\nLauren said the SA Housing Trust had \"told me nothing about the house\" but she later found out from neighbours it had previously been used to manufacture methamphetamine.\n\nLauren says neighbours told her the West Beach Housing Trust property was once used to manufacture methamphetamine.\n\nShe said that when she contacted the housing authority she was told \"the place has been cleaned, the maintenance has been done and it's habitable\".\n\n\"I've asked SA Housing if it's been cleaned and who by. They won't tell me \u2013 I've asked for documents and they say, 'Yes we'll show you but we can't give them to you',\" Lauren said.\n\n\"They've now turned around and said, 'No, we can't show you anything'.\"\n\nLauren said a newspaper report about the place had reported that two companies had conducted testing at the home, and that after ringing them she was advised that one of those tests indicated \"dangerous levels of meth in the property\".\n\n\"Housing are saying 'that's not true, there was just a little bit \u2013 a little bit over the limit on a windowsill in the bedroom',\" she said.\n\n\"I'm disgusted, what they've done. I'm disgusted that they think it's OK, that the house \u2013 they think it's OK when it's not.\n\n\"As far as what I've been told by another maintenance guy, all the power points, all the light switches and all the exhaust fans have been changed in the house, so that tells me that it was more than just a little bit that was found on a windowsill.\"\n\nLauren (right) says she and her son experienced wheezing, dry-retching and burning in the throat after moving into a West Beach Housing Trust property.\n\nShe said ambulance staff had \"told me to not come back to the property\" and that she had now resorted to \"couch-surfing\".\n\n\"I was squatting at the old property but they said to me that I had to leave,\" she said.\n\n\" They said that I'm not allowed to be there anymore, but they've charged me rent for squatting there. \"\n\nLauren says she the Housing Trust did not tell her about the property's history.\n\nLauren said she had contacted multiple government offices about the contamination concern, and said that SA Housing Trust had conducted further cleaning in the meantime \"out of goodwill\".\n\n\"I've reached out to Peter Malinauskas's office a few times \u2013 last time I rang, they said they had a letter from Nick Champion's office and it basically was exactly what Housing said \u2013 the house is habitable, it's been cleaned, it's fine,\" she said.\n\n\"As everyone said \u2013 maintenance, the neighbours \u2013 the house needs to be knocked down.\"\n\nHousing Trust to review property\n\nHousing Minister Nick Champion said he had spoken on Sunday with the chief executive of the SA Housing Trust, whom he said had on Friday \"initiated a review of this particular property with a view of resolving the issues\".\n\n\"The tenant may have to be relocated into emergency accommodation if they think that that's appropriate,\" he said.\n\n\"And we will be taking action, not just on this property but making sure that when we have properties ... that are subject to criminal behaviour and drug use that they're appropriately remediated so as to be able to be put back into the system.\n\n\" If there is some deficiency in that remediation work we will rectify that. \"\n\nHousing Minister Nick Champion says the property is under review. (ABC News: Carl Saville)\n\nHe said the home had been subjected to cleaning and had had its flooring replaced.\n\n\"As I understand it it's been tested twice \u2013 I don't know the exact dates of that. It's been cleaned thoroughly,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, he told ABC Radio Adelaide the department was \"happy\" to offer emergency accommodation to Lauren and her son, and that he was also \"happy to issue a mea culpa on behalf of the government\".\n\nHe added that the walls of the property might also be removed to allow for further cleaning.\n\nMinister rejects 'personal tours' of properties\n\nOpposition housing spokesperson Michelle Lensink said the government had been \"dismissive\".\n\n\"Lauren and her 13-year-old son who has complex needs should be provided with a safe place to live, and Housing SA aren't providing a decent response and it's not good enough,\" she said.\n\n\" Quite frankly, if Nick Champion thinks that this place is safe enough to stay in, he and his family should be prepared to stay here overnight. \"\n\nMr Champion rejected that suggestion.\n\n\"What we're about is about growing public housing,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't do that by doing sort of personal tours.\"",

        "text": "Right now, more than 311,000 Australian Facebook users can apply for a slice of a $50 million compensation fund from tech giant Meta \u2014 the largest ever payment for a breach of Australians' privacy.\n\nBut the clock is ticking. Even if you're eligible, you only have until December 31, 2025 to make your claim. Similar payouts have already begun in the United States.\n\nFrom who's eligible, to how to make a claim, to how much the eventual payout might be: here's what you need to know.\n\nWhy so many Australians can apply\n\nThe landmark settlement arose from Meta's involvement in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a massive data breach in the 2010s, when a British data firm harvested private information from 87 million Facebook profiles worldwide.\n\nAI search is the biggest change to the web in 20 years The launch of 'AI Mode' ushers in a future where news sites are kept alive to train AI chatbots for a US tech company.\n\nIt led to a record-breaking US$5 billion penalty (about $7.7 billion today) in the US against Meta as Facebook's parent company, and the creation of a US$725 million ($1.1 billion) compensation scheme for affected Americans.\n\nHere in Australia, an investigation by the national privacy regulator \u2014 the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner \u2014 found Cambridge Analytica used the This Is Your Digital Life personality quiz app to extract personal information.\n\nThat investigation found just 53 Australian Facebook users installed the app. But another 311,074 Australian Facebook users were friends of those 53 people, meaning the app could have requested their information too.\n\nIn December 2024, the Information Commissioner announced she had settled a court case with Meta in return for an \"enforceable undertaking\", including a record $50 million payment program.\n\nClaims opened on June 30 this year and close on December 31.\n\nWho can apply?\n\nYou can apply if you:\n\nHeld a Facebook account between 2 November 2013 and 17 December 2015 (the eligibility period)\n\nWere in Australia for more than 30 days during that period, and\n\nEither installed the Life app or were Facebook friends with someone who did.\n\nHow to apply \u2014 but watch for scams\n\nThe Facebook Payment Program is being administered by consultants KPMG. (Meta has to pay KPMG to run it; that doesn't come out of the $50 million fund.)\n\nThat website is where to go with questions or to lodge a claim.\n\nMeta has sent all Australians it knows may be eligible this \"token\" notification within Facebook:\n\nYou may be entitled to receive payment from litigation recently settled in Australia. Learn more.\n\nTry this link to see if the company has records of you or your friends logging into the Digital Life app. If there are, you should be able to use the \"fast track\" application.\n\nIf you didn't get that notification but you think you were affected, you can make a claim using the standard process by proving:\n\nyour identity, such as with a passport or driver's licence\n\nyou held a Facebook account and were located in Australia during the eligibility period.\n\nBut watch out for scammers pretending to be from Facebook or to be helping with claims.\n\nLoading\n\nWhich payout could you be eligible for?\n\nYou need to choose to apply for compensation under one of two \"classes\", requiring different types of proof.\n\nClass 1: the harder option, expected to get higher payouts\n\nTo claim for \"specific loss or damage\", you'll need to provide documented evidence of economic and/or non-economic loss or damages. For example, this could include out-of-pocket medical or counselling costs, or having to move if your personal details were made public.\n\nYou'll also need to show that damage was caused by the Cambridge Analytica data breach. For many people, proving extensive loss or damage may be difficult.\n\nClass 1 claims will be decided first. There are no predetermined payout amounts; each will be decided individually.\n\nIf your class 1 claim is unsuccessful, but you're otherwise eligible for a payout, you will be able to get a class 2 payout instead.\n\nClass 2: the easier option, likely to get smaller payouts\n\nAlternatively, you can choose to claim only for loss or damage based on \"a generalised concern or embarrassment\" caused by the data breach.\n\nTrump told the 'lie of the year' in 2024. Now fewer people are checking Checking facts is as old as journalism and Donald Trump's political rise has underscored its value. So why have media organisations like Meta changed tack?\n\nIt's a much easier process \u2014 but also likely to be a much smaller payment.\n\nAll class 2 claimants will receive the same amount, after the class 1 payouts.\n\nThese claimants only need to provide a statutory declaration that they have a genuine belief the breach caused them concern or embarrassment.\n\nIn Meta's enforceable undertaking with the Information Commissioner, it states KPMG is able to apply a cap on payments to claimants. It also says if there is money left after all the payouts, KPMG will pay that amount to the Australian government's Consolidated Revenue Fund.\n\nMeta told The Conversation:\n\nThere is not a pre-determined cap on payments. The appropriate time to determine whether any cap should apply to payments made to claimants is following the end of the registration period [December 31].\n\nSo it's not yet clear how much of the $50 million fund will go to Australian claimants versus how much could end up going to the federal government.\n\nPayments are expected to be made from around August 2026.\n\nHow much are payouts likely to be?\n\nPayouts from similar settlements by Meta elsewhere have been very small. For example, US Facebook users eligible for their US$725 million compensation scheme have expressed surprise at the size of their payouts. One report suggests the average US payment is around US$30 ($45) each.\n\nHere in Australia, a lot will depend on how many people bother to register between now and December 31.\n\nGraham Greenleaf is an honorary professor at Macquarie Law School at Macquarie University.

(Supplied)\n\n\"We had a very mild winter but now we're having a very cool spring, it all depends on your individual microclimate,\" Ms Dixon said.\n\nShe said tomato plants love warmer weather and sun.\n\n\"I had a terrible tomato season last year where I just didn't get much ripen at all,\" she said.\n\n\"Whilst it's great to have a general idea like 'show day's grow day', it really does depend on every single year and season.\"\n\nMs Mathews said that although the bureau could not comment on when people should plant their tomatoes, temperatures over the past few days \u2014 including show day \u2014 had been below average.\n\n\"Even today [Monday], temperatures right the way across the state are below average by up to six to eight degrees of the October average,\" she said.",

(Supplied: ACCC)\n\nThis involved navigating to the subscriptions section of their Microsoft account and selecting \"cancel subscription\".\n\nIt was only on the following page that subscribers were given the option to instead move to the classic plan.\n\nOn Monday, Ms Cass-Gottlieb thanked the more than 100 Australian consumers who made complaints to the ACCC's Infocentre in late 2024 and early 2025 about the Microsoft changes.\n\n\"It was of great assistance to us that some consumers also identified the hidden option that only became available to them when they commenced cancellation of their subscription,\" she said.\n\n\"The Microsoft Office apps included in 365 subscriptions are essential in many people's lives, and given there are limited substitutes to the bundled package, cancelling the subscription is a decision many would not make lightly.\n\n\"We're concerned that Microsoft's communications denied its customers the opportunity to make informed decisions about their subscription options which included the possibility of retaining all the features of their existing plan without Copilot and at the lower price.\n\n\"We believe many Microsoft 365 customers would have opted for the classic plan had they been aware of all the available options.\"\n\nGina Cass-Gottlieb says the regulator believes Microsoft \"deliberately omitted\" details of its classic plans.

        "text": "Australian cricket captain Pat Cummins has been officially ruled out of the first Ashes Test against England after failing to recover in time with a back injury.\n\nCricket Australia announced the decision on Monday morning, 25 days out from the opening of the Ashes series.\n\nThey confirmed that the 32-year-old had resumed running and was expected to return to bowling shortly.\n\nSteve Smith will take Cummins's place as skipper for the Test, as Australia looks to retain the Ashes following the drawn series in England in 2023.\n\nCoach Andrew McDonald said Cummins had \"run out of time\" to be ready for Perth.\n\n\"We flagged it, that [lead-time of] four-plus weeks to get him up and running, we've just run out of time,\" he said.\n\n\"But we are really optimistic for the second Test [at the Gabba].\"\n\nMcDonald confirmed that Cummins would be back bowling this week, which he described as a \"huge step\".\n\nThe coach said Australia was incredibly fortunate to have Smith able to step in as captain and to potentially have Scott Boland replace Cummins in the bowling attack.\n\n\"Losing your captain is not ideal, but when you think about Scott Boland being the potential replacement, it's not terrible,\" he said.\n\nBroad fires shot at Aussies Stuart Broad lights the fuse ahead of the men's Ashes series, saying England has its best chance of winning in Australia since the 2010/11 series.\n\n\"Steve Smith will slide into that [captain's] position.\n\n\"When he [Cummins] does come back, what an exciting addition he will be.\"\n\nA fortnight ago Cummins admitted he was \"probably unlikely\" to be fit for the first Test, but was still trying to fast-track his recovery to make it in time.\n\n\"We'll see how we go with the first Test,\" Cummins told ABC Sport at the time.\n\n\"[We've] still got a bit of time. I'd say [it's] probably unlikely at this stage [I will be fit for Perth], but [we're] doing everything we can to be right.\n\n\"Initially for a while it was quite awkward, really. I wouldn't say an acute pain, but it gets stiff, and even holding a little baby after five minutes, you feel like you need to stretch your back a bit.\n\n\"The first step's reintroducing running, then some bowling prep work, so with net balls, then short run-up, full run-up and then, when you want high intensity, you want lots of overs.\n\n\"Our timeline's pretty tight so we're trying to condense what would normally take a few months into a little bit shorter than that, but we've got a pretty clear path. It's quite a common bowling injury so we know how to deal with them.\"\n\nStream End Game with Tony Armstrong on ABC iview Tony Armstrong will tackle Australia's overdue reckoning with racism in sport, with the help of some of its biggest sports stars.\n\nCummins has not bowled since Australia's tour of the West Indies in July.\n\nThe decision ends weeks of speculation over the captain's presence in Perth, but given Cummins has not yet begun to test his body with bowling, there is no guarantee he will be ready for the second Test at the Gabba, beginning on December 3.\n\nMcDonald's comments confirm the most likely player to replace Cummins in the team is Boland.\n\nAnother possible replacement, Sean Abbott, was injured in a Sheffield Shield game on October 15 when he split the webbing in his right hand while fielding off his own bowling.",

        "text": "Nick Mangold's long, blond hair and bushy beard made him instantly recognisable. His gritty, outstanding performance on the field for the New York Jets made him one of the franchise's greatest players.\n\nMangold, a two-time All-Pro centre who helped lead the Jets to the AFC championship game twice, has died, the team announced Sunday. He was 41.\n\nThe Jets said in a statement that Mangold died Saturday night from complications of kidney disease.\n\nHis death came less than two weeks after the two-time All-Pro selection announced on social media that he had kidney disease and needed a transplant. He said he didn't have any relatives who were able to donate, so he went public with the request for a donor with type O blood.\n\n\"I always knew this day would come, but I thought I would have had more time,\" he wrote in a October 14 message directed to the Jets and Ohio State communities.\n\nMangold was a fan favourite at the Jets with his iconic blond hair. (Getty Images: Dan Mullan)\n\n\"While this has been a tough stretch, I'm staying positive and focused on the path ahead. I'm looking forward to better days and getting back to full strength soon. I'll see you all at MetLife Stadium and The Shoe very soon.\"\n\nMangold said he was diagnosed with a genetic defect in 2006 that led to chronic kidney disease. He was on dialysis while waiting for a transplant.\n\n\"Nick was more than a legendary centre,\" Jets owner Woody Johnson said in a statement.\n\n\"He was the heartbeat of our offensive line for a decade and a beloved teammate whose leadership and toughness defined an era of Jets football. Off the field, Nick's wit, warmth, and unwavering loyalty made him a cherished member of our extended Jets family.\"\n\nThe Jets, looking for their first win of the season, announced Mangold's death about an hour before kick-off of their game against the Cincinnati Bengals. A moment of silence was held in the press box before the game.\n\nMangold grew up in Centerville, Ohio \u2014 about 70km north of Cincinnati \u2014 but remained in New Jersey, close to the Jets' facility, after his playing career ended.\n\nNew York Jets fans hold up a Nick Mangold jersey after the game against the Cincinnati Bengals on Monday morning. (Getty Images: Dylan Buell)\n\nMangold was a first-round draft pick of the Jets in 2006 out of Ohio State and was selected to the Pro Bowl seven times. He helped lead New York within one win of the Super Bowl during both the 2009 and 2010 seasons and was enshrined in the Jets' ring of honour in 2022.\n\nMangold was among 52 modern-era players who advanced earlier this week in the voting process for next year's Pro Football Hall of Fame class.\n\nMangold was the anchor of New York's offensive line his entire playing career, spending all 11 seasons with the Jets.\n\n\"I was fortunate to have the opportunity to lace them up with you every Sunday,\" Pro Football Hall of Famer Darrelle Revis, Mangold's teammate for eight years, wrote on X.\n\n\"I will miss you and forever cherish our moments in the locker room. Love you buddy.\"\n\nMangold started every game during his first five seasons and missed only four games in his first 10 years before an ankle injury limited him to eight games in 2016, his final season.\n\n\"It's brutal,\" former Jets coach and current ESPN analyst Rex Ryan said during Sunday NFL Countdown while fighting through tears.\n\n\"Such a great young man. I had the pleasure of coaching him for all six years with the Jets. I remember it was obvious I was getting fired, my last game, Mangold's injured \u2014 like, injured \u2014 and he comes to me and says, 'I'm playing this game.' And he wanted to play for me.\n\n\"That's what I remember about this kid. He was awesome. And it's just way too young. I feel so bad for his wife and family. (This is) rough.\"\n\nMangold was released by the team in 2017 and didn't play that season. The following year, he signed a one-day contract with the Jets to officially retire as a member of the team.\n\n\"Rest in peace to my brother and teammate Nick Mangold,\" tweeted former running back Thomas Jones, who played three years with Mangold.\n\n\"I keep seeing your smiling face in the huddle bro. One of the kindest people I've ever met. One of the greatest interior linemen to ever play the game. This one hurts. Surreal.\"\n\nSeveral other former teammates mourned the loss of Mangold.\n\n\"Absolutely gutted,\" former wide receiver David Nelson, who played with Mangold for two seasons, wrote on X.\n\n\"One of the best guys I've ever met \u2014 true legend on and off the field.\"\n\nFormer kicker Jay Feely, Mangold's teammate for two seasons, tweeted: \"Heartbreaking news this morning. Nick and I played together with the Jets and loved to banter about the Michigan/Ohio St rivalry. He was a natural leader, a great player, thoughtful, kind, and larger than life.\"\n\nDoug Martin dies after struggle with police Police say former Tampa Bay running back Doug Martin died after an attempted detainment following reports of a break-in.\n\nMangold's number 74 jersey remained a popular one for fans to wear at games, even nine years after playing his final NFL game. He was active with charitable events and often dressed as Santa Claus for the team's holiday celebrations for children.\n\n\"Nick was the embodiment of consistency, strength, and leadership,\" Jets vice chairman Christopher Johnson said in a statement.\n\n\"For over a decade, he anchored our offensive line with unmatched skill and determination, earning the respect of teammates, opponents and fans alike. His contributions on the field were extraordinary \u2014 but it was his character, humility, and humor off the field that made him unforgettable.\"\n\nMangold is survived by his wife, Jennifer, and their four children Matthew, Eloise, Thomas and Charlotte.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

        "text": "The Kangaroos are ready to ram home their opening-game supremacy in the Ashes with a vastly improved second-Test performance \u2014 even without their luckless leader Isaah Yeo.\n\nThere was much sympathy in the camp for the skipper, who had described leading Australia back into Ashes combat after 22 years as the \"pinnacle\" of his career, only for his big day at Wembley to be ended after just seven minutes with a \"bad\" head knock.\n\nThe collision with England's Dom Young that forced him out will also mean the four-time NRL champ missing out on Sunday morning's (Australian time) second Test at Everton and the chance to lead the Kangaroos to a 14th-straight series win.\n\nBut under the stand-in captaincy of Harry Grant, Australia is determined to improve on the opening 26-6 win, adamant there's major improvement to come despite the convincing nature of their four-try victory.\n\n\"It was a bad knock that [Yeo] got, but we've got good medical staff who'll look after him this week, and we'll see where he's at in the next few days. He's a tough hombre, so he's not going to say too much,\" coach Kevin Walters said.\n\nIt is possible that, with an 11-day enforced absence after the category-one knock, the skipper's series could be over, especially as he's had a history of concussions.\n\nWalsh hailed a 'freak of a player' Nathan Cleary and Cameron Munster heap praise on Kangaroos teammate Reece Walsh following his stunning Test debut against England at Wembley.\n\nAustralia overcame his absence comfortably, with Reuben Cotter filling in seamlessly.\n\n\"I expect us to get better in game two,\" Walters predicted.\n\nAustralia might have won even more convincingly if English referee Liam Moore had not slowed down the ruck speed, Super League-style, which suited the home side.\n\n\"The rucks, yeah they were definitely slower than back home, but that was to be expected,\" shrugged Nathan Cleary.\n\n\"Everyone gets away with a little bit more, it's definitely a different style to back home.\"\n\nBut he reckoned the team had been helped by having Willie Peters, Hull KR's championship-winning coach, as an assistant to Walters, guiding them on how to deal with the different interpretation.\n\nAnd at Everton, there is an expectation that with Australian grand final referee Grant Atkins on the whistle, the ruck speed will be faster, playing right into the hands of the Kangaroos' superior attacking resources.\n\nIt was possible to already sense a hint of resignation in the home camp about the glaring gulf in quality.\n\nEngland coach Shaun Wane is likely to give AJ Brimson a run after the Gold Coast man was left out as 18th man and home fullback Jack Welsby proved ineffective.\n\nCanberra's Morgan Smithies is in line to be called in too.\n\nABC will live blog the second Ashes Test between Australia and England at Everton on Sunday morning Australian time \u2014 the game starts at 1:30am AEDT.\n\nAAP",

        "text": "After Australian artist Thea Proctor returned from London in the 20s, a critic dubbed her art \"dangerously modern\".\n\nSixty years later, critic Bernard Smith dubbed women like Proctor, who travelled to Europe at the turn of the century and returned with new painting styles and techniques, simply \"messenger girls\".\n\nThese artists were celebrated in Europe, as part of Paris and London's flourishing art scenes.\n\nAt home, much of their work was dismissed.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nIn fact, few works by some of these artists remain, including most of Edith Collier's nudes, which were burned by her father in New Zealand.\n\nBut a new exhibition at the Art Gallery of New South Wales (AGNSW) in Sydney \u2014 after a first season at the Art Gallery of South Australia (AGSA) in Adelaide earlier this year \u2014 corrects these misguided notions about the role of women artists in the history of Australian art.\n\nIt's Dangerously Modern: Australian Women Artists in Europe 1890-1940, and features more than 200 works by well-known artists like the first woman Archibald winner Nora Heysen and cubist painter Dorrit Black, alongside lesser-known artists like Collier (and one of her rare surviving nudes).\n\nHere are six paintings you shouldn't miss:\n\nFillette au perroquet (Little girl with parrot) by Bessie Davidson\n\nLike many other Australian women artists of her generation, Bessie Davidson had long wanted to visit Paris when she first travelled there aged 25, in 1904, with her art teacher Margaret Preston (more on Preston later).\n\n\"These artists really wanted to be on the world stage,\" Elle Freak, associate curator of Australian art at AGSA, says.\n\n\"The national art school [L'\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris] opened up to women in 1897, so there were new professional opportunities.\n\n\"But also, within the bohemian circles of Paris, they had more opportunities to live freely \u2014 politically, culturally, artistically, sexually.\"\n\nDavidson moved permanently to Paris in 1910, where she set up a workshop in Montparnasse, co-founded the Salon des Tuileries in 1923, and, from 1930, served as vice-president for La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Femmes Artistes Modernes, a group dedicated to promoting women artists.\n\n\"Bessie Davidson became best known for her interior portraits,\" Freak says. \"She often depicted women and children in the threshold spaces of her Paris apartment \u2014 in doorways, on balconies, by windows.\"\n\nOnly two solo exhibitions of Davidson\u2019s work have been held in Australia since her death in 1965. (Supplied: AGSA)\n\nOne of those balcony portraits is 1913's Fillette au perroquet (Little girl with parrot).\n\nIn an essay, Freak says the domestic paintings of arts like Davidson may be seen as \"statements of independence and artistic liberation\".\n\n\"At this moment, we see [Davdison's] palette shifting dramatically,\" Freak says. \"There's a lightness to the palette and vibrancy to her use of colour, and it's a very big shift from the dark tonal realism of her early work.\n\n\"It's very typical of Davidson to focus on a young girl. She painted many of her female friends and their children, and she's painting this girl completely fixed on the parrot in the top right-hand corner.\"\n\nMe by Justine Kong Sing\n\nThe smallest painting in Dangerously Modern is Justine Kong Sing's self-portrait Me, from about 1912, which is only 6.1 x 4.5 centimetres.\n\nWhile she was in Europe, Kong Sing exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London and the Paris Salon. (Supplied: AGNSW)\n\nIt's one of only eight known surviving works by Kong Sing \u2014 also including a portrait of her brother Otto, a solicitor \u2014 after a callout during the AGSA season uncovered four miniatures in the home of one of her distant relatives, which they donated to AGNSW.\n\n\"It's doubled the known number of works by her,\" Wayne Tunnicliffe, acting director of collections at AGNSW, says.\n\nThe daughter of a Chinese miner and merchant living in regional NSW, Kong Sing only travelled to Europe at the age of 43, after scraping together the money to travel by working as a governess. She is believed to be the first professional Chinese Australian women artist.\n\n\"She had the strong drive to be an artist throughout her life, even though that was not part of her background at all,\" Tunnicliffe says.\n\n\"These miniatures, even though they're tiny, have whole worlds within them, and entail so much about her life and her engagement with the world.\"\n\nKong Sing's experience in Europe proved liberating. In a 1914 letter, she described how no-one noticed her when she arrived in London, in stark contrast to the racial prejudice she experienced in Australia.\n\n\"In the colonies, where foreigners are treated differently, an Oriental suffers keenly the mortification of being stared at, and often assaulted, because of his colour!\" she wrote.\n\n\"She found London more accepting than Australia at this time,\" Tunnicliffe says.\n\nThames at Chelsea Reach by Dora Meeson\n\nWhile artists like Davidson painted scenes of domestic life, Dora Meeson, a suffragette, resolved to paint en plein air (outdoors).\n\nHer decision was both an artistic and a practical one, as she shared a studio in London's Chelsea with her husband, fellow artist George Coates, who she first met at art school in Melbourne.\n\n\"They couldn't both fit in there,\" Tunnicliffe says.\n\nOver about 40 years, Meeson returned over and over to the scene of the River Thames, then one of the major traffic arteries through London. One such work is Thames at Chelsea Reach, painted in about 1913.\n\nMeeson organised her fellow artists, designed banners for marches, and even signed her husband up as a male supporter of women\u2019s suffrage. (Supplied: AGNSW)\n\n\"This particular work shows this wonderful silvery grey scene of the Thames; both from the fog and smog catching the light,\" Tunnicliffe says.\n\n\"The focus is on these dark hulks of the working ships but surrounded in this light and atmosphere. She also uses very evident brushwork to push her paint around, so you get a sense of her physical presence as an artist.\"\n\nThroughout her life, Meeson would return to Australia to exhibit and sell her and Coates's work, where they were praised for their skill, even as they tackled what was then considered masculine subject matter.\n\nHer dedication to getting her work in front of people was shared by other artists in the exhibition, including Thea Proctor and Hilda Rix Nicholas.\n\n\"They were committed to being artists and [wanted] their art to be seen and to be experienced. They really pushed it out there into the world,\" Tunnicliffe says.\n\nA view of the Irish coast by Margaret Preston\n\nIn 1914, Margaret Preston moved for eight months to the remote Irish village of Bonmahon (now Bunmahon).\n\nThat summer, she, then-partner Gladys Reynell, and Kiwi artist Edith Collier all painted the town; their three works feature in Dangerously Modern.\n\nPreston returned with a class of more than 20 women artists in 1915. But, after German torpedoes sunk the British ocean liner the RMS Lusitania that May, the Irish government prohibited paintings of the coastline, fearful they would convey information to the Germans.\n\nTunnicliffe says A view of the Irish coast is one of only two known Irish landscapes by Preston \u2014 both of which are on display in Sydney.\n\nPreston encouraged her students to: \u201cLet yourself go! Feel what you are doing. Feel it!\u201d (Supplied: AGNSW)\n\n\"You can see how she's pushing her practice,\" he says.\n\n\"She was a tonal painter before this. [Her Irish landscapes are] quite mute brown paintings, [with] creamy and pastel colors and strong diagonals. [She's] influenced by Japanese prints, [using] black outlines around the houses to highlight them, which is taken from French art.\"\n\nLeaving Europe, Preston returned to a conservative Australian art scene, Tunnicliffe explains.\n\n\"It was focused on outdoor landscape painting and national subjects; masculine labour in the landscape,\" he says.\n\n\"Margaret Preston came back and said, 'There's a whole other way to have a national language', and she did it through still-life painting and including indigenous plants and references to Aboriginal culture.\n\n\"[These paintings of Bonmahon] really are a key seed for modernism in Australia in the 1920s.\"\n\nType of the Latin Quarter by Agnes Goodsir\n\nAgnes Goodsir was in her mid-30s when she decided to move to Paris, in 1900.\n\n\"Her aim was to find herself,\" Freak says.\n\nShe was best known for her depictions of cosmopolitan women, including her partner, the American musician Rachel Dunne, nicknamed Cherry.\n\n\"They formed a really wonderful relationship that lasted over many years,\" Freak says.\n\n\"When Goodsir passed away, it was Dunne who took care of her legacy and her archive, which included sending works back to her home in Australia.\"\n\nCherry is the subject of Goodsir's painting Type of the Latin Quarter, from about 1926.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think critics in Australia who were reviewing [Goodsir\u2019s] exhibition in 1927 really saw the queer coding within her works,\u201d Freak says. (Supplied: AGNSW)\n\n\"Often her works would hint towards the very liberated setting in which they lived in Paris,\" Freak says.\n\n\"For instance, there are hints towards coded sapphic symbolism in this work, including a ring on Rachel's pinky finger, which was, in some circles in Paris in the 1920s, a queer symbol. It was often worn by suffragettes, lesbian women or first-wave feminists.\"\n\nGoodsir did briefly return to Australia in 1927, where she held an exhibition of her work, which included Type of the Latin Quarter. Conservative critics praised her art for its realism.\n\n\"There was a sense that she was not taking up the more progressive '-isms' of the day,\" Freak says.\n\n\"But, in fact, we know that if you look beneath the surface of her works, she certainly was a modern woman and her works are more subtly, perhaps, but nevertheless, incredible radical depictions of the day.\"\n\nSelf-portrait by Stella Bowen\n\nSoon after moving from Adelaide to London at 20, in 1914, Stella Bowen mixed with writers and artists including T.S. Eliot, W.B. Yeats, Gertrude Stein and Edith Sitwell.\n\nThere, she also met the writer Ford Madox Ford, 20 years her senior. They had a daughter in 1920.\n\nBut by the time Bowen painted this self-portrait in about 1928, the couple were separating after nine years together. He'd had an affair with writer Jean Rhys, who detailed their relationship in her debut novel, Quartet.\n\n\u201c[Bowen] is not as well known as some of her male contemporaries and some of her female contemporaries back in Australia,\u201d Freak says. (Supplied: AGSA/Saul Steed)\n\n\"We see in this work Stella Bowen working at the height of her power as an artist who expressed emotion and psychological depth,\" Freak says.\n\n\"[She] gives us such a penetrating gaze. Her eyes are fixed on ours and she has deliberately cropped the composition so that we focus on her paint smock and that incredible stillness of her emotional state.\n\n\"At this point, when she was parting ways with Ford Madox Ford, she spoke about needing to find her shape again, and to find herself.\n\n\"You really get that here. She's telling us she's an artist. She may have been going through a difficult time, but she was working towards an exhibition of her work in 1931 that would give her a moment of great success.\"\n\nFreak suggests artists like Bowen may have painted self-portraits like this one because their travel to Europe marked not only a professional breakthrough, but a personal transformation.\n\n\"What better way to think through where you are in the world than to paint yourself.\"\n\nDangerously Modern: Australian Women Artists in Europe 1890-1940 is at Art Gallery of New South Wales until February 15.",

According to Bessent, China might defer the introduction of its tighter export controls for a year \u201cwhile they re-examine it\u201d. It would, of course, retain the option of reintroducing them at any point should the relationship with the US flare up again. Chinese President Xi Jinping. His country has flexed its biggest trade muscle against the US. Credit: Getty Images What would the US gain in return for China not (yet) deploying the most powerful trade weapon in it its armoury? Again according to Bessent, China\u2019s negotiators have agreed to make \u201csubstantial\u201d purchases of US soybeans.\n\nEver since Trump\u2019s first trade war, in 2018-19, China has been reducing its purchases of soybeans from American farmers. Loading The US once accounted for about half China\u2019s soybean imports. Last year it was less than 20 per cent and in the latest harvest season not a single bean has been bought. Instead, more than 90 per cent of China\u2019s imports are now from Brazil, along with some recent purchases from Argentina. That \u2013 particularly the purchases from Argentina while the Trump administration is spending tens of billions of dollars to try to prop up the Argentinian peso in an attempt to bolster the political fortunes of Trump\u2019s friend and political fellow-traveller, Javier Milei \u2013 has caused a bitter backlash from US soybean producers. A resumption of the US-China soybean trade might help placate those Midwestern farmers, who form a core political constituency for Trump, although it is unlikely that the US will ever regain the share of China\u2019s market that it had before Trump started his trade wars.\n\nChina has essentially locked up all the soybeans it needs for this year and a significant proportion of next year\u2019s needs and, in any case, is unlikely to restore any level of dependence on the US for an essential element of its food chain. In 2020, after the US and China signed their \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal that ended the first of Trump\u2019s trade wars, there was an initial surge in China\u2019s soybean purchases from the US. But it quickly fell away and China failed to meet the $US200 billion commitment it made to buy not just soybeans, but other American products. It bought less than 60 per cent of what it had committed to and less than it had imported from America before the trade war started. Still, if buying some soybeans from the US, deferring implementation of its rare earths export controls, and co-operating on trying to stem the fentanyl trade buys it relief from US tariffs \u2013 including the 20 per cent surcharge related to its role in the fentanyl supply chain \u2013 means the shipping charges are abolished and China achieves some relaxation of the US restrictions on semiconductors exports, Xi would consider it a win.\n\nTrump, of course, is more concerned about being able to say he\u2019s done a deal rather than focusing on its quality. Along with the negotiations with China, the US unveiled framework deals with Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia, under which many of their exports to the US would be exempt from Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs in exchange for preferential market access for US industrial and agricultural products. No details were released on which exports from the South-East Asian countries would be excluded from the US tariffs, which are 19 per cent for Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia and 20 per cent for Vietnam. The leverage in these negotiations is, as the US seems to have belatedly realised, quite lopsided. Ironically, had Trump not, in 2017, withdrawn the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement that the Obama administration had signed in 2016, but not yet ratified, America would have had open access to the Vietnam and Malaysia markets years ago.\n\nAssuming Xi and Trump sign the deal their negotiators agreed, some of the trade tensions and frictions will ease, which would be positive for both their economies and the global trade environment. But Trump is unpredictable and petulant, as demonstrated by his additional 10 per cent tariff on Canada in response to an advertisement that simply reproduced snippets of Ronald Reagan\u2019s compelling arguments against tariffs. Loading China has, however, flexed its biggest trade muscle and the alacrity which Trump and his administration switched from talking tough to saying nice things about Xi and China showed just how powerful that dominance of rare earths is. It will take years, if not decades, for the US to insulate itself against that threat. Meanwhile, Xi can trump the American president\u2019s threats of extreme tariff rates with something far more effective and less damaging to his own economy than Trump\u2019s tariffs.",

It is the second iteration of the package, with Watt's predecessor, Tanya Plibersek, accused of breaking a 2022 election promise after she pushed back tabling reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nOvernight, Opposition leader Sussan Ley and Opposition environment spokesperson Angie Bell wrote to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese asking Labor to split the bill.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Labor moves to create Australia's first national environment watchdog\n\nThey argue parliament could make \"immediate progress\" on pro-business initiatives, such as streamlining project approvals, while demanding that environmental protections be addressed at a later date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot of complexity in this bill at the moment, and to split the bill would make it very clear for the outcomes, and the two outcomes that we want to see are faster approvals and streamlining those approvals and environmental protections,\" Bell told ABC Radio National on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatt has labelled it \"the maddest idea\", rejecting the demands, which he argues would lead to \"more habitat destruction, more species threatened, no independent regulator and slower approval times\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everyone understands why she's [Ley] changed her mind is because she's desperately trying to shore up her leadership ahead of some very difficult net-zero conversations with her party room,\" Watt told reporters on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This week, Sussan Ley is in danger of putting her own leadership ahead of the environment and ahead of business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We can't split the bill, we need to do both, and we know we need to get on with it.\"\n\n\n\nWatt is \"confident\" his proposal addresses the recommendations by the 2020 Graeme Samuel report , the conclusions of which were previously supported by Ley, who commissioned the environmental laws review.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Samuel told the ABC he was \"frustrated\" and \"frankly, a little angry\" about the Greens' and the Opposition's positions on the proposed changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens say they are still open to negotiating with Labor, despite the government abandoning a \"climate trigger\" that the party hoped would be used to block coal and gas projects it says would worsen carbon emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the minor party criticised the environmental law changes as having \"big business and the mining companies' fingerprints all over it\".\n\n\n\nWhat we know about the environmental law reforms\n\nWith the bill not yet tabled, details of the reforms have been drip-fed to concerned parties, including business groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Watt announced the nation's first-ever National Environmental Protection Agency, tasked with ensuring compliance under the proposed new laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, key powers for project approvals and accreditation of state and territory processes will remain with the minister.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatt argues the changes will streamline approval processes, removing duplication across state and federal governments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we want to do is work with the state so that at least the assessments can be done by a state government on behalf of both the state and federal government, potentially saving months or years in an approval process,\" he told ABC News Breakfast.\n\n\n\nThe bill also includes stiffer penalties for environmental regulatory violations, including fines of up to $825 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed changes include an \"unacceptable impact\" test for high-polluting projects, requiring companies to disclose expected emissions and set up carbon abatement plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, with Watt giving extreme examples of the threshold for accepting or rejecting projects, the test's threshold remains murky.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If a mining company wanted to go and mine under Uluru, and perish the thought they would ever want to do that, but clearly that kind of thing is going to be unacceptable because of the environmental damage that it would cause,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So they're the kind of things that we're seeking to try to stop and stop early in the process.\"\n\n\n\n",

It's all about delivering long overdue reforms that are so badly needed to make sure we have laws of the 21st century. Not being stuck with laws that were introduced by John Howard, back in the last century.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been two independent reviews of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act since it came into effect in 1999.\n\n\n\nThey have both called major changes to the Act, with the latest review in 2020 finding that without urgent changes, most of Australia\u2019s threatened plants, animals and ecosystems will become extinct.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft is being sued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, over an alleged breach of consumer law.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regulator has commenced legal proceedings in the Federal Court against Microsoft Australia and its parent company Microsoft Corporation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt alleges Microsoft misled millions of Australians from October last year when it did not disclose to subscribers of Microsoft 365 plans that they could retain their plan - without accepting the price increase that came with the integration of AI assistant [[called Copilot]] into the software.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ACCC says it is seeking penalties and consumer redress against Microsoft, without specifying a dollar figure.\n\n\n\n\n\nA company that is found to breach Australian consumer law could be a fine of $50 million - 30 per cent of the corporation\u2019s adjusted turnover during the breach turnover period for the offence.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian government has hailed the signing of a new treaty, which aims to combat cybercrime through increased cooperation and information sharing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations says the convention targets a broad spectrum of offences - from phishing and ransomware to online trafficking and hate speech.\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics have warned the vague definition of crime could enable abuse.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Matt Thistlethwaite, attended the signing ceremony in Vietnam\u2019s capital, Hanoi over the weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says it is important now for countries to follow through - and ensure implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Convention also encourages strong protection for victims, including access to recovery, compensation, and the removal of illicit content. By creating binding obligations, the convention turns our commitment into practical safeguards. Today's signing is an important milestone in our shared journey to a safer digital world. The true power of the convention will lie into signatures into tangible action.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n72 countries have now signed the treaty, and now goes through a process of being ratified by each nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe treaty will formally come into effect 90 days after the 40th state confirms its ratification.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN estimates that cybercrime costs the global economy trillions of dollars each year.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Formula One, Lando Norris has snapped a five-race winless streak and passed McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri in the fight for the Formula One championship, by winning at Mexico City.\n\n\n\n\n\nPiastri came from seventh and used a late pass of George Russell to finish fifth - a critical gain because it allowed Norris to take just a one-point lead over Piastri in the championship race.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella says Piastri did well to move up to fifth place - and there will be further opportunities to improve in upcoming races.\n\n\n\n",

Everyone is known, and everyone is being picked up and swept along at their own pace.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it\u2019s rewarding work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Seeing someone realise that, yes, I can do this just watching their confidence grow throughout the program and seeing the possibilities the future possibilities open and expand, is the best part of the job.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGrant funding for the position comes through 26Ten, a Tasmanian program working to lift adult literacy and numeracy skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior literacy advisor at Libraries Tasmania, Iona Johnson, says 26TeN has worked with more than 4,000 learners since it started in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People generally come in with an idea of what it is that they're wanting to achieve in their life, and realising that literacy has kind of got in the way of them being able to achieve that. So they generally have some life goals that you know will tailor that learning around. So it might be about wanting to learn to read to their child. It might be about, you know, wanting to successfully pass a white card or a first aid certificate or do something towards repositioning themselves in terms of work.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data on adult literacy and numeracy levels comes from the OECD, under the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competences, or PIAAC.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figures show as many as one-in-five Australians have low levels of literacy or numeracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Approximately 14 per cent of people have literacy skill levels below level two, so at much lower levels, who are likely to experience a significant gap between what they're able to do and their ability to engage in everyday life. 21 per cent of people have that gap in terms of their numeracy skills.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese figures were released more than 10 years ago, with those in the sector keen for an update to see what has \u2013 or hasn\u2019t \u2013 changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So the last survey was done in 2012 what the results came out in 2012 which is quite a long time now. It's very old data.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia temporarily withdrew from PIAAC but has since re-joined, with fresh data expected in 2029.\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs and Skills Australia is also conducting a national survey of adult literacy and numeracy skills, with those results due in late 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Cedrick Smith, a little help has opened up a lifelong career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It could take me a lot of places. There's unrelated fields where they need work that involves a carpentry background. I'm not too sure yet, I'm sort of open to what's going to come next. I'll sort of wait and see. (It could involve) you know having my own business maybe.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Sound of a saw)\n\n\n\n",

Again according to Bessent, China\u2019s negotiators have agreed to make \u201csubstantial\u201d purchases of US soybeans.\n\nEver since Trump\u2019s first trade war, in 2018-19, China has been reducing its purchases of soybeans from American farmers. Loading The US once accounted for about half China\u2019s soybean imports. Last year it was less than 20 per cent and in the latest harvest season not a single bean has been bought. Instead, more than 90 per cent of China\u2019s imports are now from Brazil, along with some recent purchases from Argentina. That \u2013 particularly the purchases from Argentina while the Trump administration is spending tens of billions of dollars to try to prop up the Argentinian peso in an attempt to bolster the political fortunes of Trump\u2019s friend and political fellow-traveller, Javier Milei \u2013 has caused a bitter backlash from US soybean producers. A resumption of the US-China soybean trade might help placate those Midwestern farmers, who form a core political constituency for Trump, although it is unlikely that the US will ever regain the share of China\u2019s market that it had before Trump started his trade wars.\n\nChina has essentially locked up all the soybeans it needs for this year and a significant proportion of next year\u2019s needs and, in any case, is unlikely to restore any level of dependence on the US for an essential element of its food chain. In 2020, after the US and China signed their \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal that ended the first of Trump\u2019s trade wars, there was an initial surge in China\u2019s soybean purchases from the US. But it quickly fell away and China failed to meet the $US200 billion commitment it made to buy not just soybeans, but other American products. It bought less than 60 per cent of what it had committed to and less than it had imported from America before the trade war started. Still, if buying some soybeans from the US, deferring implementation of its rare earths export controls, and co-operating on trying to stem the fentanyl trade buys it relief from US tariffs \u2013 including the 20 per cent surcharge related to its role in the fentanyl supply chain \u2013 means the shipping charges are abolished and China achieves some relaxation of the US restrictions on semiconductors exports, Xi would consider it a win.\n\nTrump, of course, is more concerned about being able to say he\u2019s done a deal rather than focusing on its quality. Along with the negotiations with China, the US unveiled framework deals with Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia, under which many of their exports to the US would be exempt from Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs in exchange for preferential market access for US industrial and agricultural products. No details were released on which exports from the South-East Asian countries would be excluded from the US tariffs, which are 19 per cent for Malaysia, Thailand and Cambodia and 20 per cent for Vietnam. The leverage in these negotiations is, as the US seems to have belatedly realised, quite lopsided. Ironically, had Trump not, in 2017, withdrawn the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement that the Obama administration had signed in 2016, but not yet ratified, America would have had open access to the Vietnam and Malaysia markets years ago.\n\nAssuming Xi and Trump sign the deal their negotiators agreed, some of the trade tensions and frictions will ease, which would be positive for both their economies and the global trade environment. But Trump is unpredictable and petulant, as demonstrated by his additional 10 per cent tariff on Canada in response to an advertisement that simply reproduced snippets of Ronald Reagan\u2019s compelling arguments against tariffs. Loading China has, however, flexed its biggest trade muscle and the alacrity which Trump and his administration switched from talking tough to saying nice things about Xi and China showed just how powerful that dominance of rare earths is. It will take years, if not decades, for the US to insulate itself against that threat. Meanwhile, Xi can trump the American president\u2019s threats of extreme tariff rates with something far more effective and less damaging to his own economy than Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
