        "text": "Historically, petrol stations across Australia provided personalised service, with attendants to look after you, wash your windscreen and check your car's water, oil and air.\n\nBut by the 1990s bespoke customer service was on the decline. So, what happened?\n\nThe turning point largely came about when fuel pumps went from mechanical to computerised, according to historian and author Colin Dennett.\n\n\"The cause for the change slowly began as a combination of new pumps, fewer outlets and the era of high-volume company-operated sites developed,\" Mr Dennett said.\n\n\" Once site operators realised they could control say 20 pumps from one operator on the console inside, that must have been hugely labour saving. \"\n\nBowsers were hand-operated when Golden Fleece, Australia's first independent fuel producer, began in 1913. (Supplied)\n\nRetail service stations in Australia have reduced from 22,000 sites in 1966 to approximately 8,000, generating roughly $38 billion annually.\n\n\"The retail scene is basically dominated by multinationals but there's a few independents that break away from that, which is truly unique, and keeps the market competitive,\" Mr Dennett said.\n\nThe NRMA's report Making Cents of Fuel says the presence of independent operators can influence market competition, being at least 7 to 10 cents cheaper per litre in some regional towns, with lower overhead costs.\n\nHowever, refiners and wholesalers still hold over 80 per cent of the market and Ampol is the biggest wholesaler.\n\nToday, driveway service it not offered by major petrol stations across Australia; however, it is possible to find small, independent operators who still provide it.\n\nDriving the market\n\nOn a 12-kilometre stretch between Shellharbour and Warrawong on the New South Wales south coast there are 12 petrol stations.\n\nJimmy Pavlevski's independent station in Windang is one of them.\n\nJimmy Pavlevski says staffing issues mean it's challenging providing personalised service. (ABC Illawarra: Sarah Moss)\n\nWhen he purchased the business in 1998, the adjacent caravan park had a stream of people with vans and boats needing fuel.\n\n\"It was a lot more vibrant then, more people and very enjoyable meeting all different people every school holidays,\" Mr Pavlevski said.\n\nSome older customers call ahead for driveway service. (ABC Illawarra: Sarah Moss)\n\nMr Pavelvski said back then, people worked Monday to Friday and Sunday was family day.\n\n\"They'd fill up, get some snacks and go for a family drive; that doesn't happen anymore,\" he said.\n\n\"Sunday used to be the busiest day, now it's the slowest.\n\n\"All people do now is sit on their phones.\"\n\nSo, for the past few years his station has been running on the smell of an oily rag and even personalised service is dwindling due to lack of interest.\n\nAnd Mr Pavleski can no longer afford staff.\n\n\"I can't provide that service full-time, only when customers require help,\" he said.\n\n\" A few elderly customers call before they're on their way, so they'll rock up and they'll beep the horn, and I'll go out and service their vehicle. \"\n\nThere are as many fuel stations as kilometres between Shellharbour and Warrawong on the NSW south coast. (Google Maps)\n\nAs well as competing with other fuel stations, Mr Pavlevski is juggling the loss of tobacco sales, increasing fuel costs, EVs, large fridges to power and monthly card fees; he says it's a common story for independent service stations.\n\n\"I'm never going to be competing with major service stations, I'm quite happy with what I have, what I've built up and the community I provide for,\" Mr Pavlevski said.\n\nSuburban stations disappear\n\nDriveway service in the 1970s.

        "text": "Far North Queensland may be renowned for its rainforests, monsoons and cyclones, but nestled in heart of the wet tropics one town claims to be a literal ray of sunshine.\n\nProudly boasting 300 sunny days a year, Mareeba, near the Atherton Tablelands on the range west of Cairns, is just 180 kilometres north of Australia's wettest town, Tully.\n\nBut while Mareeba is known for its clear days, whether or not the marketing matches the weather records is more cloudy.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology's Livio Regano said Mareeba did have a drier climate compared to other parts of the region, due to a \"rain-shadow\" effect.\n\n\"It just means that if you're behind a big range and the eastern side catches the moisture, most of the rain falls on that side and by the time the air comes over the other side, it's already dried out a bit,\" Mr Regano said.\n\n\"The moisture has been rung out on the eastern side like a wet sponge getting squeezed and there's nothing left in it.\n\n\"On the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range, you're in a rain shadow, and that includes most of the Atherton Tablelands.\"\n\nMost of the Atherton Tablelands are in a rain shadow. (Flickr: Geoff Whalan, CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)\n\nWhile it makes for a pleasant climate, Mr Regano said the \"300 days of sun\" claim was harder to substantiate.\n\nTo accurately measure sunshine statistics, a sunshine recorder is needed.\n\nMareeba does not have one.\n\nBut there is a weather station at the airport, which has recorded an average 86 clear days, and 95 cloudy days per year.\n\n\"That nowhere near adds up to 300 sunny days a year, unless your definition of sunshine is that the sun pokes through the cloud, at least for one minute every day,\" Mr Regano said.\n\n\" By comparison to any place along the coast but especially compared to the Daintree and the Cassowary Coast, Mareeba certainly does have a sunnier climate because of this rain-shadow effect. \"\n\nWhen comparing the days of sun in Mareeba to other towns and cities in different parts of Australia, it doesn't quite make the leaderboard.\n\n\"It's not comparable with what they have, for example, in the Burdekin and around Townsville \u2014 you know the Townsville Dome as we all call it,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the weather station at the airport, Mareeba has an average 86 clear days, and 95 cloudy days. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\nSeeking sunnier days\n\nGaining traction in the 1990s, the tagline \"300 sunny days a year\" became popular as the once-thriving tobacco industry declined, and Mareeba sought a fresh identity.\n\nRochelle Harding from the Mareeba Shire Council, which erected a sign with the slogan, said the sunny weather had proven to be one of the town's greatest assets, especially for tourism.\n\n\"It's an ideal location for recreational flyers with access to the Mareeba Airport and for hot air ballooning,\" she said.\n\n\"Mountain bikers, hikers and campers benefit from the reliable weather, with easier access to outback stations and trails.\n\n\"Mareeba's climate also attracts grey nomads, who enjoy the warm, dry conditions while camping and exploring the region at their leisure.\"\n\nThe official records are one thing, but for Peter Howe from Rock Ridge Farming, the proof is in the avocados and bananas he grows in both Mareeba and the Atherton Tablelands.\n\nHe said although his blocks were relatively close in proximity, he noticed the difference in production and climate.\n\nPeter Howe farms avocados and bananas on the Atherton Tablelands. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\n\"We've got we got ladyfingers [bananas] down at Mareeba and in Atherton, and there's a about a four-week delay on the ones in Atherton coming in versus Mareeba,\" he said.\n\n\" That sunshine saves us four weeks a year. \"\n\nMr Howe said picking bananas was also more efficient in sunny conditions, and bigger bunches were produced.\n\n\"You just need sunshine to make everything grow and perform,\" he said.",

        "text": "For more than a decade, South Korean director Hwang Dong-hyuk couldn't convince a studio to fund his film project about a brutal game show that preyed on society's most vulnerable.\n\nIt wasn't until the late 2010s, after Hwang became a household name in South Korea, that Netflix took notice. They convinced the director to elongate his proposal, and he created an eight-episode miniseries that would become Squid Game.\n\nWhen he was writing Squid Game, he had one goal: to make the show rank \"No 1 on the Netflix US chart for at least a day\".\n\nThe success of the show's first outing resulted in a second season, released while South Korea was in the middle of political unrest. Now, the third and final season has arrived.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nK-drama-mania\n\nWhile the international interest in capitalism-critical dramas from Korea might seem to have come from nowhere, appetite has been steadily growing in the country for decades.\n\nSquid Game brought South Korea's horror debt crisis to life Photo shows A still from the Netflix show Squid Game, with a group of people in pink hazmat suits and black masks With its technicolour sets and outlandish plot, Squid Game might seem like just another dystopian fantasy. But for Koreans who live with crippling debt, it hits closer to home.\n\nTo understand its rise, you must first understand the climate in which it has flourished, says Dr Sung-Ae Lee, an expert in Korean popular culture at Macquarie University. Over its short history, South Korea has experienced radical social change at an incredibly fast pace, Dr Lee says. The country went from military dictatorships of the mid-20th century to \"capitalist industrialisation\" to the \"fragile and conservative version of democratisation\" in the 1990s.\n\n\"However, the country still manifests distinctly traditional characteristics of a feudal society. Power and wealth are concentrated in the hands of 1 per cent of the people, and social mobility is almost impossible,\" Dr Lee told ABC Entertainment.\n\n\"Censorship had eased by the turn of the century but South Korean media are still liable to censor 'political' material. So criticism of capitalism really only dates from the 21st century.\"\n\nSoon after the turn of the millennium, anti-capitalist themes began popping up in South Korean films \u2014 such as Bong Joon Ho's The Host (2007), which \"uses the monster genre to comment on the negative effects on the lower classes of South Korea of foreign economic manipulation, environmental pollution and military intervention\".\n\nBong's interest in capitalism-critical creations would lead him all the way to the Academy Awards, where his 2019 film, Parasite \u2014 a story about a lower-class family infiltrating a rich family \u2014 became the first non-English-language film to win Best Picture.\n\nBong Joon-ho's Parasite interrogates class in a tale of rich and poor families who intertwine Photo shows Still of Kang-ho Song, Hyae Jin Chang, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park sitting together folding pizza boxes in 2019 film Parasite. A poor family insinuate themselves into employment with a wealthy one in Bong Joon-ho's tragicomedy, which won the Palme d'Or, Oscar and Sydney Film Prize.\n\nDr Lee says the social anxiety prevalent in modern South Korean cinema has spoken to disgruntled attitudes towards capitalism worldwide.\n\n\"Squid Game articulates anxiety about neoliberal capitalism: precarious employment and disposable workers (they kill them!); huge income inequality; the callousness of the rich; and suggests that aspirations to wellbeing are futile,\" she says.\n\n\"Unlike most TV dramas, it eschews a 'happy ending'.\"\n\nSquid Game is also not the first Hwang original to have a tangible impact outside of the screen. His 2011 film, Silenced, tackled a real sexual-assault scandal at Gwangju Inhwa School for the Deaf in the early 2000s.\n\n\"The film attracted over 3 million viewers nationwide within two weeks of its release and became a box office sensation,\" Dr Lee says.\n\n\"As a result of the events depicted in this film, the case was reopened and stronger legislation was established.\"\n\nSquid Game creator Hwang Dong-hyuk with lead actor Lee Jung-jae in a behind-the-scenes image. (Supplied: Netflix)\n\nThe real-world impacts\n\nWi Ha-joon \u2014 who has played police officer Hwang Jun-ho since the show's inception \u2014 says he's seen the tangible impact Squid Game has had on the Korean film and TV industry.\n\n\"[Squid Game] led to a lot of attention coming from abroad and that facilitated a lot of investment,\" he told ABC Entertainment through an interpreter.\n\n\"This has made the production conditions for these Korean content better and also better in quality.\"\n\nHwang Jun-ho (Wi Ha-jun) remains committed to exposing the Squid Game despite multiple attempts on his life. (Supplied: Netflix)\n\nAnd, for better or for worse, the Squid Game effect hit reality TV with a resounding boom.\n\nFirst there came Squid Game: The Challenge, a Netflix-branded British reality show that mimicked everything about its Korean inspiration (minus the killing). Then Amazon produced a rival show that capitalised on the popularity of YouTuber Mr Beast.\n\nWhile Beast Games also eliminated slaughter, it still caught-class action lawsuits for allegedly leaving contestants starving, injured and in need of therapy.\n\nBut Squid Game's impact has reached further than television screens. In late 2021, dozens of Korean Confederation of Trade Unions members donned the distinct hot pink jumpsuits of the deadly guards in the show to protest about pay and conditions.\n\nLast year, as the Korean government was wading through political turmoil following South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol's declaration of martial law, Hwang used the launch of Squid Game season two to address the similarities between the show and reality.\n\n\"Season two draws a lot of parallels with what we are witnessing in the world right now,\" he said while urging Koreans to take to the streets over political unrest.\n\n\"And with a heavy heart, I feel that watching \u2026 Squid Game is not going to be very different from watching the news \u2014 and that's how I want you to take it.\"\n\nSo, what have we learnt?\n\nHwang has never been reticent about why he signed onto more seasons of Squid Game.\n\n\"Money,\" he told BBC.\n\n\"Even though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly, I didn't make much. So doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\"\n\nThe ravenous desire for Squid Game reached further than demand for more episodes, and their dystopian spin-offs.\n\nSince the first season, the show about the very worst side of capitalism became a full-on brand.\n\n\"I think his chances to feel remorse are long gone. Everything that he has done is unforgivable,\" Lee Byung-hun says about his character's shot at redemption. (Supplied: Netflix)\n\nFashion labels such as Crocs, Puma and Oodie clambered to announce collabs. The distinct green-and-pink Squid Game branding has been plastered on everything from whisky bottles to frozen dumplings, with Netflix bragging about more than 100 'partnerships' with the show.\n\nMcDonalds Australia released an official Squid Game meal, complete with a dalgona dessert \u2014 a reference to the candy-based task in the show that saw characters shot if they didn't complete it in time.\n\nPlayers had to remove a printed shape from the middle of fragile dalgona candy to avoid execution in Squid Game season one. (Supplied: Netflix)\n\nBut for the show's long-time stars \u2014 Wi Ha-joon and Lee Byung-hun, who plays the morally corrupt leader of the games, The Front Man \u2014 it's never been about taking didactic lessons from a television show.\n\n\"I don't think [Squid Game] is trying to force a message on the viewers,\" Lee told ABC Entertainment. \"It is just an embodiment of all the social and political issues that are going on in the world, that everyone is feeling.\n\n\"I think it's just trying to create room for us to have that conversation.\"\n\nWi agrees, saying his time on the show made him ponder his own choices.\n\n\"[Squid Game] is showing the world on a smaller scale the side-effects of capitalism,\" he says.\n\n\"[Over the three seasons] I was also asking myself, 'Is there humanitarian love and humanity existing in this world still?'\"\n\nSquid Game season three is streaming on Netflix now.",

(ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\nTheir noisy nature and restrictions by local councils means roosters routinely need to be rehomed, but Ms Robinson believes the practice of \"dumping\" them is becoming more common.\n\nShe believes the high price of eggs is leading to an increase in the popularity of backyard chicken flocks and means more people are buying unsexed chicks and ending up with roosters they are unable to keep.\n\n\"You don't know when you're buying them if you are going to get females or males, so it's a bit of a lucky dip,\" she said.\n\n\"They take them home, they raise them and out of the size little fluffy chickens they've brought, they're going to find that three or four are going to be roosters.\"\n\nMs Robinson says her rescue group has been inundated with reports of roosters being dumped this year.

(ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\nMs Robinson said when her group is notified about dumped roosters it can take many days to capture them.\n\n\"Usually once we find them we set up water and food and then we try and go back there every day so they get used to us. Once we know that they're coming for food and water then we'll set up our trap,\" she said.\n\nThey then use what she calls the \"dinner and a date\" method using a hen and food to lure a rooster into a crate.\n\n\" Once the hen starts clucking and making little noises the little boy comes running. \"\n\nFlipper was dumped in a park in Ayr with 11 other roosters.

(Supplied: Suburban Rail Loop Authority)\n\nUnder the SRL, getting from Cheltenham to Burwood will take an estimated 19 minutes. (Supplied: Suburban Rail Loop Authority)\n\nThe estimated travel times, which compare to both existing public transport and car-based options, are based on 2025 examples, but the $34.5 billion first leg of the orbital rail tunnel is not due to open until 2035.\n\nThe report calculated future journey times along more than 40 routes, with a focus on population hubs, hospitals, medical centres and universities.\n\nIt also showed how journeys to and from other parts of the city would be altered by the rail loop, with the inclusion of examples such as travel between Footscray and Deakin University in Burwood. The data suggests that journey would take 43 minutes \u2014 6 minutes faster by public transport, and 11 minutes faster than driving.\n\nMinister for the Suburban Rail Loop, Harriet Shing, said the journey times showed the project would help Melbourne \"grow well\".\n\n\"We know that at the moment people spend a lot of time in traffic, and they're having to go into the city before heading back out again,\" she said.\n\nThe Suburban Rail Loop project was announced by Labor before the 2018 election. Harriet Shing (R) is now Minister for the Suburban Rail Loop. (AAP: James Ross)\n\nAs work progresses, the government has been compelled to defend the mammoth project amid issues including an Infrastructure Australia report casting doubt on the project's financial viability and concerns from residents in communities earmarked for major development.\n\nPlanners' estimates 'conservative', expert says\n\nMonash University public transport expert Graham Currie said the estimated travel times laid out in the report were \"quite conservative\".\n\n\"They've compared the railway to existing travel times by car,\" he said.\n\n\" By the time they open this thing ... travel times will be much worse in Melbourne because traffic congestion will have grown. \"\n\nGraham Currie says car congestion in Melbourne will only worsen before the SRL opens. (ABC News: Kristian Silva)\n\nThe existing public transport journey times were calculated using the Public Transport Victoria app around 8am on a weekday, and the car travel times using Google Maps.\n\nThe completion of SRL East will involve the construction of 26 kilometres of twin tunnels connecting six stations.\n\nProfessor Currie said he believed residents in the city's east would support the project despite its cost and timeline.\n\n\"The people that live in these suburbs have been car-dependent for a long time,\" he said.\n\n\"They know the traffic's growing, and they're looking for an alternative, and this is a very attractive one.\n\n\"It's expensive, though.\"\n\nThe ambitious project will run through Melbourne's middle suburbs. (Supplied: Infrastructure Victoria)\n\nThe SRL project, first announced by the Victorian government in the lead-up to the 2018 state election, is due to be completed in three parts, with tunnel boring on SRL East to begin next year.\n\nIt will be the most expensive infrastructure project in the state's history.",

        "text": "Mick Hughes loved being a firefighter, serving his community and the camaraderie that came with the job \u2014 but it was a job that would claim his life.\n\nLast year, he died less than a year after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.\n\nHis widow, Heather, has little doubt the cancer was caused by decades of exposure to toxic chemicals in fires.\n\nAfter a battle with WorkCover his disease was recognised as an occupational illness, but when Heather made a dependency claim after he died, it was rejected.\n\n\"I was quite shocked because initially I thought, well, you've already accepted liability,\" she said.\n\n\"You've already paid for his medical expenses, paid for his wages while he was sick, and now that he's gone, he's not covered.\n\n\"It's double standards.\"\n\nDependency claims entitle a worker's dependents to financial support following a work-related death.\n\nThe rejection is a decision Ms Hughes is now fighting, and her family's plight has highlighted deficiencies and inconsistencies in a system that is meant to recognise the high risk firefighters have of contracting deadly cancers.\n\n\"He was a very fit man, but was always concerned about attending all these toxic fires,\" Ms Hughes said.\n\n\"He attended about six metal recycling fires in the western suburbs and then he would come home, and he'd say, 'I just try and keep away from the smoke'.\"\n\nDependency claims assessed differently: WorkSafe\n\nIn Victoria, 15 cancers are part of presumptive rights, meaning firefighters who get them automatically get compensation and assistance because of the link between the disease and firefighting. Similar schemes exist in other states.\n\nThroughout his nearly 35 years in the fire brigade, Mr Hughes attended dozens of toxic fires, including the Coode Island disaster in 1991.\n\nThe 1991 Coode Island fire started when chemical storage tanks exploded. (ABC News)\n\nVictoria's WorkCover system, through provider Gallagher Bassett, recognised that his cancer was a work-related illness and provided him with assistance.\n\nBut it wasn't without a fight. Pancreatic cancer is not one of 15 cancers that automatically qualify for compensation, and the claim was initially rejected.\n\n\"I said, 'Mick we're fighting this',\" Ms Hughes said.\n\n\"He didn't have the strength to fight it, but I said, 'I'm going into battle for you, Mick. Someone needs to have a voice for you'.\"\n\nAfter conciliation, Gallagher Bassett accepted the claim.\n\nBut there was more heartache after he died.\n\nMick Hughes died of pancreatic cancer less than a year after being diagnosed. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)\n\nGallagher Bassett told Ms Hughes she could make a dependency claim, which she did, only to have it rejected.\n\nThe company referred questions to WorkCover, who said it did not comment on individual claims.\n\nIt said dependency claims were assessed differently to those made by an original recipient.\n\nMs Hughes has appealed the decision, but she is speaking out because she wants the law changed to protect other firefighters who will get cancer.\n\nDecision shows 'breathtaking hypocrisy'\n\nIn other states, firefighters are covered for pancreatic cancer, as are federally employed firefighters at Melbourne Airport.\n\nMs Hughes said she would fight to set the same standard in Victoria.\n\n\"I would like to set a precedent for the other firefighters that are coming through that are going to get pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, all the cancers that aren't under the designated cancers at the moment,\" she said.\n\n\"Presumptive legislation should cover every single cancer, full stop\"\n\nIn 2023, the state government expanded the eligible cancers to include cervical, breast and ovarian cancers.\n\nThe then-Minister for Emergency Services, Jaclyn Symes, told parliament that officials were assessing pancreatic and five other cancers to see if they would be added to the list.\n\nHeather Hughes holds the medals awarded to her late husband Mick. (ABC News: Danielle Bonica)\n\nCurrent minister Vicki Ward said she had the deepest sympathies for Mr Hughes' family.\n\n\"We are incredibly grateful for the invaluable service of emergency service workers and the critical work that they do which can increase their exposure to certain types of cancer,'' she said.\u200c\n\n\"We will continue to monitor whether Victoria's presumptive compensation legislation appropriately reflects the increased risks emergency service workers can face due to their service.\"\n\nUnited Firefighters Union secretary Peter Marshall said Ms Hughes had suffered from \"breathtaking hypocrisy\".\n\n\"The claim is supposed to be there for the dependencies, for the family members,'' Mr Marshall said.\n\n\"Firefighters are not an expendable commodity, where they can just send them into burning buildings and not provide the protection to their family in the event they get ill.\n\n\"It's just wrong.\"\n\nOpposition backs scheme expansion\n\nThe Victorian Opposition is also backing an expansion of the scheme.\n\nLiberal MP Nick McGowan said there was \"something wrong\" if the state couldn't look after those who risked their lives in service.\n\n\"It's obviously a travesty, it's wrong and we're looking to the government to reverse it,'' Mr McGowan said.\n\n\" This government continues, unfortunately, to pick and choose, and when it comes to cancer we shouldn't be picking and choosing. \"\n\nMs Hughes has vowed to keep fighting.\n\n\"This man served his community for 35 years,\" she said.\n\n\"He put his life at risk for the community and ultimately, he lost his life.\n\n\"Was it worth it?

        "text": "Teenage sensation Maya Joint has earned an epic, back-to-the-wall victory at the Eastbourne Open to give Australia's challenge at Wimbledon the perfect launch pad.\n\nThe US-born 19-year-old, who has been making a stratospheric rise in the sport since relocating to Queensland less than two years ago, saved four match points on her way to defeating fellow rising star Alexandra Eala in a pulsating tie-break finale on Sunday (AEST).\n\nIt meant Joint became the first Australian player to win the women's title in the 50-year history of the British seaside event, which has become the traditional curtain raiser for the grass-court grand slam, which begins on Monday.\n\n\"It's been an amazing year, an amazing two years,\" Joint said at Devonshire Park, while saluting Aussie coach Chris Mahony, who she credits with transforming her career.\n\n\"Thank you for everything you've done. You're a lifesaver.\"\n\nThe astonishing 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (12/10) win will rocket Brisbane-based Joint, who only turned 19 in April, to number 41 in the world when she kicks off her maiden Wimbledon with a tough opener against Russian number 19 seed Liudmila Samsonova on Tuesday.\n\n\"I'm very happy right now, feeling very relieved as well. It was a very difficult match,\" Joint said.\n\n\"I'm proud of myself for coming back and staying in the match, even though I'd lost about nine of the last 10 games.\"\n\nJoint had been 5-2 down, and almost out, in the final breaker, having to come up with fabulous defensive scrabbling to stay in contention as Eala came agonisingly close to becoming the Philippines's first ever WTA champion.\n\nBut the teenage daughter of former Sydney squash professional Michael Joint demonstrated real courage and calm in a terrific showdown which, after a nervy spell from both players as they both homed in on the title, really hit the heights in the youngest final since Tracy Austin and Andrea Jaeger in 1981.\n\nFor Eala, who has become a young heroine in the Philippines, it was all so crushing after Joint sealed the deal with a backhand cross-court winner that the 20-year-old was in tears, with the Australian trying to console her that \"we will definitely play in more finals\".\n\nRemarkably, Joint's run to her first WTA title on the clay at the Morocco Open five weeks ago also came on the weekend before a grand slam, and she then got knocked out in the first round by Ajla Tomljanovi\u0107.\n\n\"It's really great preparation. I've got a lot of matches in before Wimbledon, and hopefully I can be in Wimbledon a little bit longer than I was in the French,\" Joint said.\n\n\"I think this time's a tiny bit different. I get one more day of rest, and I'll just detach myself a little bit more from the last match, and just focus on the match coming up.\n\n\"But I'm just really excited to get to London later today and step into Wimby for the first time.\"\n\nAAP",

Wednesday\u2019s solo recital affirmed Lang Lang\u2019s great affinity with the romantic repertory in a program underlining poetics, rather than pyrotechnics.\n\nFaure\u2019s beloved Pavane was treated almost too delicately with whispered phrases and half-lit sonorities. Schumann\u2019s Kreisleriana, arguably one of his least approachable works, sprang to life with vividly etched contrasts between aching melodic outpourings and frenetic, fiery outbursts. Traversing a dozen Chopin Mazurkas, Lang Lang illuminated the huge variety of moods and styles the composer was able to achieve in this rhythmically lopsided dance form. Among their sometimes-playful perversity, the melancholy sensuality of the A minor, Op. 17 stood out for its meltingly beautiful timbre. Pianist Lang Lang with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Credit: Nico Keenan The official program ended in a blaze of glory with the imposing Polonaise in F-sharp minor, Op. 44, before encores that included a diaphanous account of Debussy\u2019s Clair de lune and a truly incendiary reading of de Falla\u2019s Ritual Fire Dance. Saturday\u2019s breathtaking account of Saint-Saens\u2019 Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra was more in keeping with Lang Lang\u2019s rock star image. A strange amalgam of styles, the concerto was once described as \u201cbeginning with Bach and ending with Offenbach\u201d.\n\nLoading After the dramatic opening with its baroque overtones and the amusing, nonchalant scherzo, the blinding virtuosity of the tarantella finale left many wondering how anyone could play so fast and so accurately. Images of a fluttering hummingbird came to mind. This seemingly superhuman\n\ntalent, the stuff of lasting memories, unsurprisingly elicited a rapturous ovation. Two encores, Liszt\u2019s Liebestraum No. 3 and the Disney tune Who\u2019s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf? were strange bedfellows. Bookending the concert, chief conductor Jaime Mart\u00edn revelled in the festive Spanish air of Ravel\u2019s Alborada del gracioso, graced with perfectly judged bassoon cameos by Elise Millman. Mussorgsky\u2019s Pictures at an Exhibition in Ravel\u2019s wondrous orchestration was supported by lustrous string tone and cohesive, strongly characterised playing throughout the orchestra. Among the solos, Owen Morris\u2019s rapid-fire trumpet impressed. The rousing solemnity of The Great Gate of Kyiv seemed a timely and fitting conclusion. Hopefully, those who came to witness Lang Lang\u2019s technical brilliance went away from these concerts realising that he is a well-rounded romantic, whose art is both dazzling and deeply empathetic. For that, he really does deserve a rock star reception.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nJem Cassar-Daley \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nNorthcote Social Club, June 28 These are golden days for feeling blue. The Northcote Social Club was thoroughly charmed on Saturday night by the collective heartbreak of three charismatic Gen Z songwriters singing a big, sad world of everyday calamities while positively beaming with the first rush of being heard. Jem Cassar-Daly at the Northcote Social Club. Credit: Richard Clifford Anxiety is the confessed bete noir of Belgian expat Romanie. She silenced the early arrivals with a finger-picked electric guitar, impish banter and songs drawing on the agonies of Palestine, climate grief and fragile hope. They played like first drafts of raw experience, roaring with a voice that threatened to scream and ultimately did. An even fresher voice from rural New South Wales, Mikayla Pasterfield opened with her TikTok breakthrough Damage You Still Do \u2013 an assured first dip into a well of childhood guilt, unrequited love and worldly resilience. Her pealing giggle between songs brought ample light, even to that intriguingly loaded one about buying a goldfish, Tactile.\n\nSteeped from birth in old-school stagecraft and grit, Jem (daughter of Troy) Cassar-Daley upped the energy with a slick bass-drums-guitar trio and a gushing dedication to her \u201cincredible\u201d sisters in song before throwing herself into the last night of her Kiss Me Like You\u2019re Leaving tour. From the post-romantic inner monologue of Slow Down to the homesick airline stationery letter Space Between, her songs mine a consistent emotional register: sharp-focus country-pop ballads laced with the genre\u2019s traditional sighs of longing and brave-faced disappointment. As a writer, she\u2019s moving fast. Changes was an oldie from the 2022 debut album that she\u2019s all but left behind. The paint was barely dry on Tidal Wave and one or two others, even if it took a couple of inspirational covers \u2014 Gwen Stefani, Addison Rae \u2014 to bring any real sonic surprise. Mikayla Pasterfield returned to make a seamless duet of Texas Ain\u2019t That Far, Is It Dear?, the sheer joy of communion making the song\u2019s fundamental melancholy evaporate like an old memory. The headliner\u2019s inevitable encore, King of Disappointment, radiated with the same sense of bliss reclaimed in the thrill of performance. For all its gentle sorrows, that joy was the glaring takeaway from this show: three stunning singers claiming a world where blokes are sidemen and women draw strength from bills stacked with more women, then laugh about it on the way to the bar. Some nights, one guitar solo is enough.\n\nReviewed by Michael Dwyer\n\nTHEATRE\n\nSuper \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nRed Stitch, until July 6 Superhero culture is dangerous because it\u2019s \u201cessentially fascism\u201d, according to Alan Moore. Trump once released a non-fungible token of himself as a superhero with eye lasers, let\u2019s not forget, and the adolescent fantasy of fighting evil with superpowers looks frankly terrifying when it plays out in the world. A production shot of Super at Red Caroline Lee, Laila Thaker and Lucy Ansell explore their powers in Super. Credit: Credit Cameron Grant - Parenthesy Anyone who thinks seriously about the subject should be worried by the infantilising nostalgia, the power worship, and the narcissistic sense of exceptionalism that seem to have gripped the imagination of a so-called adult audience. At the same time, it\u2019s true that satire and subversion from within \u2013 the nerdy reality-check of Kick-Ass, say, or the cynical vision of corporatised \u201cSupes\u201d in The Boys \u2013 can act as a kind of kryptonite to the worst tendencies of the genre. Emilie Collyer\u2019s new play Super gives us a fantastically silly and strange sideswipe at the superhero tropes we\u2019ve inherited. It\u2019s a full-throttle feminist funfest that will tickle those who love the grandiose cosplay and game-changing powers of superhero stories, while dodging hypermasculinity and ultra-violence, launching a guerrilla attack on gender inequality, and celebrating female friendship into the bargain.\n\nTwo besties \u2013 Nell (Laila Thaker) and Phoenix (Lucy Ansell) \u2013 are the only members of their superpower support group, and their special abilities are drawn from a distinctly feminine arsenal. Phoenix has a preternatural gift for suppressing her rage and can calm others against their will. Nell is, well, super-organised \u2013 a paragon of unpaid labour who can fast-track solutions to almost any problem. When Rae (Caroline Lee) first enters their gathering, they think she\u2019s taken a wrong turn \u2013 the AA meeting\u2019s down the hall. But the celebrity chef has a superpower of her own. She\u2019s so in touch with her own sorrow that if she bursts into tears, she can make anyone cry helplessly alongside her.\n\nIt comes in handy when the ageing star\u2019s producers threaten to dump her from her TV show: Rae weeps and wails and weaponises her victimhood until they relent. Laila Thaker as Nell \u2013 her power is being super-organised. Credit: Cameron Grant - Parenthesy Phoenix is suspicious of the new arrival \u2013 they\u2019re almost opposites of each other \u2013 but all three are determined to use their powers to do good in the world, despite the prickliness, and despite their powers coming at a physical cost (nothing special power suits can\u2019t fix, though that comes at a price, too). Soon their charity work becomes big business. Rae uses her celebrity to start a reality TV show judging whether ordinary contestants have superpowers. Phoenix gets ripped and fights against gang and domestic violence in marginalised communities. Nell turns their enterprise into a mega-corporation fuelled by big data, drastically enhancing the good they can do \u2026\n\nLoading A dystopian twist and climactic confrontation looms, as liberal aims begin to be achieved through \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 fascist means. Can they right themselves, or will they become villains and victims of their own success? Emma Valente directs an almost painfully entertaining show, featuring exaggerated, laugh-out-loud funny performances and spectacular visual gags and costumes. The examination of power isn\u2019t quite as fleshed out as you might hope, but the ending is radical in a way that restores perspective. The greatest superpower, it seems, might be the ordinary human comfort of genuine friendship.\n\nReviewed by Cameron Woodhead\n\nIMMERSIVE THEATRE\n\nThe Door in Question \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMetro West Footscray, until June 29 Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are still a source of fear, confusion and stigma. Troy Rainbow\u2019s remarkable mixed-reality immersive theatre event, The Door in Question, fights against them by opening a portal into altered perception, utilising the latest VR and interactive AI technology. The Door In Question is an immersive theatre experience using VR. Credit: Lauren Marr This is a solo trip into the labyrinth of the disordered mind. And if that sounds risky, the project is so sensitively realised that it feels unique in humanising (without remotely romanticising) what psychosis is like, inside and out. It helps that the artist has skin in the game. Rainbow\u2019s mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia \u2013 a deeply personal experience and an inspiration for the world you\u2019ll enter.\n\nAudiences first step into an antechamber that serves as a meditation room. A few deep breaths are needed before donning a VR headset in a Footscray shopping mall and stepping down the rabbit hole. A colourful, disturbing wonderland awaits, based on a childhood story Rainbow\u2019s mother wrote for him. Disorienting voices guide you through gritty urban landscapes, decrepit domestic environments, and a world based on classical mythology \u2013 statues of Medusa, fountains, ancient Greek columns \u2013 and onwards and upwards into a florid brush with divinity \u2026 or paranoid delusion. Disorienting voices guide you through decrepit domestic environments in The Door in Question. Credit: Lauren Marr You\u2019re inducted into a secret history of Footscray (including its Indigenous history) as you walk the streets to a second location, and I don\u2019t want to spoil what happens there. The less you know, the better, though I can say it\u2019s a full-body experience. The show will quite literally make your spine tingle, twisting the design surprises and interactive mystery of immersive theatre and escape rooms towards a higher purpose.\n\nIn fact, it almost portrays mental illness as a kind of escape room\u2026 one with no escape, and a profusion of clues everywhere you look. Each space is engagingly designed, and there\u2019s a haunting quality to the voice acting and the polyphonic script, some of which sounds as if taken verbatim from people with schizophrenia.\n\nHallucinatory audiovisual tricks keep you on edge, painfully vigilant, and one section involves a responsive AI program, as a grandiose delusion tightens its grip. Loading Exploring psychosis through mixed reality tech is a fabulous idea, and The Door in Question really does feel at the forefront of a brave new kind of artmaking. But it\u2019s the human element that makes it work \u2013 the profound authenticity of lived experience, and the unflinching insight into the danger and distress, as well as the wildcard beauty \u2013 and, yes, the love \u2013 amid the deranged tangle of psychotic illness.\n\nReviewed by Cameron Woodhead\n\nMUSIC\n\nACO Unleashed, \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nAustralian Chamber Orchestra, Hamer Hall, June 22 Undaunted by the withdrawal of injured Moldovan violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja from its current tour, the Australian Chamber Orchestra (ACO) took the opportunity to draw soloists from its own ranks in a program confirming all its appealing strengths. Anna da Silva Chen plays with the Australian Chamber Orchestra as part of ACO Unleashed. In the absence of artistic director Richard Tognetti, longstanding violinists Helena Rathbone and Satu Vanska shared direction of the orchestra. They were joined by the ACO\u2019s newest member, Anna da Silva Chen, in a buoyant account of Bach\u2019s Concerto for Three Violins. Clearly delighting in their collaboration, they wove the music\u2019s contrapuntal strands into a richly detailed tapestry, abetted by the ACO\u2019s customary rhythmic drive. Vanska brought an edgy bravura to Bernard Rofe\u2019s arrangement of Ravel\u2019s Tzigane to which the presence of the celesta in the accompanying forces contributed an additional exotic touch.\n\nLoading Exemplary ensemble and beauty of tone graced Tognetti\u2019s arrangement of Beethoven\u2019s String Quartet in F minor, Op. 95 \u201cSerioso\u201d. Nuanced variations of texture reinforced both the original\u2019s urgency and intimacy. Schubert\u2019s Quartet Movement in C minor, D. 703 shimmered like a jewel, full of light and shade, where dramatic and lyrical elements were held in admirable balance. Giving the Melbourne premiere of Jaakko Kuusisto\u2019s Cello Concerto, principal cellist Timo-Veikko Valve gave a passionate tribute to the late composer, a longtime family friend and fellow Finn. Kuusisto, who died of brain cancer in 2022, aged 48, conceived this well-crafted work with Valve\u2019s considerable technical and expressive prowess in mind. Like Sibelius, Kuusisto often sets his emotional lyricism in sparse surroundings. Here, some percussion freshened the orchestral palette, further enticing the listener\u2019s close attention. Empathetically supported by his fellow players, Valve\u2019s advocacy of this score may well make it a 21st-century classic.",

        "text": "\u201cThe development of GLP-1 and incretin-based drugs has revolutionised the space. It has carved out the biggest class of drugs ever. And it has the power to truly revolutionise our health-span,\u201d said Associate Professor Garron Dodd, head of the Metabolic Neuroscience Research Laboratory at the University of Melbourne and founder of Gallant Bio, which is developing its own obesity drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s a glorious dawn, but it\u2019s just the start.\u201d Garron Dodd, head of the Metabolic Neuroscience Research Laboratory at the University of Melbourne, is also founder of Gallant Bio. Credit: Chris Hopkins Weight loss in a pill Much as our eyes and ears sense the world and send data to our brains, our digestive tracts need ways of sending back data on what they are eating, and how much. They do this, in part, by secreting various chemical signals \u2013 hormones. Glucagon-like peptide-1 is secreted by the intestines and triggers the pancreas to produce insulin. The first GLP-1 drugs took advantage of this to become powerful treatments for diabetes.\n\nBut GLP-1 has much wider effects beyond blood-sugar control. Receptors for the hormone spread throughout the body, even in the brain, where they trigger a feeling of fullness and decrease appetite. A once-weekly dose of semaglutide, plus lifestyle changes, led volunteers in a phase 3 trial to lose 14.9 per cent of their body weight over 15 months. GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy essentially copy that human hormone. That makes them fragile. They need to be kept refrigerated, and injected subcutaneously rather than taken by mouth \u2013 as the stomach\u2019s acid would quickly break them down. An oral version of semaglutide has been developed, but only 1 per cent of the drug actually makes its way to the target receptors, and it appears less effective than the injectable version for weight loss. Loading Researchers at Japan\u2019s Chugai Pharmaceutical Co figured out a way around this problem. They designed a small molecule that can bind to the same receptor as GLP-1 and trigger it. It mimics the effect without mimicking the structure. \u201cIt\u2019s a development I never would have thought feasible,\u201d said Professor Michael Horowitz, a University of Adelaide researcher who authored a commentary on the drug in the Lancet. Chugai licensed the molecule to US-based Eli Lilly in 2018. Last week, the company reported participants on the highest dose in a clinical trial lost 7.9 per cent of their body weight over 40 weeks.\n\nThe full details of the trial have not yet been reported, and whether the weight loss is maintained over the longer term is unclear. More than a quarter of patients reported diarrhoea, 16 per cent nausea and 14 per cent vomiting. The preliminary results are \u201cclose enough to broadly call it similar\u201d to semaglutide, said Professor Jonathan Shaw, who led the Australian arm of Lilly\u2019s trial at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can confidently say it\u2019s better or worse. It\u2019s definitely in the same ballpark.\u201d It\u2019s also not known if the drug will offer the range of other benefits that GLP-1 inhibitors provide in addition to weight loss, like reductions in cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer\u2019s risk (and maybe even addictive behaviours). Horowitz said the efficacy data was promising, but he wanted to see more information about adverse effects, which he said were understated generally across semaglutide trials because they relied on patients to report their own side effects. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t served the interests of pharma to quantify how well this is tolerated.\u201d Pfizer was developing a similar once-daily GLP-1 pill but cancelled the program in April after a patient in a clinical trial suffered liver damage.\n\nA pill should, theoretically, be cheaper and easier to make than an injector \u2013 Novo Nordisk, maker of Wegovy and its diabetes drug antecedent Ozempic, has struggled to keep up with demand for semaglutide \u2013 and dramatically easier to transport. At present, the drug must be kept refrigerated right from European factories to a patient\u2019s home. \u201cThat all adds to the cost,\u201d said Shaw. There could also be cost benefits from increased competition as more drugs are approved \u2013 possibly pushing the price down far enough for governments to consider subsidising it. Lilly expects to apply for regulatory approval for the drug later this year. While orforglipron has attracted the most excitement \u2013 Eli Lilly\u2019s shares have surged since they announced the trial results \u2013 it is just one of several new drugs in late-stage development. These drugs might be of particular value to 15 per cent or so of people whose bodies do not seem to respond to semaglutide. And people don\u2019t seem to stay on the injectable drugs \u2013 less than half are still using them a year later, per a study 2024 study \u2013 despite the fact weight rebound is likely if you stop using them. \u201cIs it the injection? Is it the cost? Or is it due to adverse effects? We don\u2019t know,\u201d said Horowitz.",

Then she ... induced me to take out debt as well.\u201d He met Pasaribu in 2022 through his mother, who was also studying at TAFE in inner-city Ultimo. \u201cMum and Rina became quite good friends,\u201d he said. The main victim of Rina Pasaribu\u2019s scam said it had been a nightmare. Credit: Louie Douvis\n\n\u201cShe came over to my house for Christmas. When my dad got sick as well, she was going to the hospital. I thought of her as family. It wasn\u2019t just some \u2018random off the street\u2019 type of thing.\u201d He said Pasaribu obtained discounted laptops for people in the TAFE class and had also offered cheap flights. He travelled to Tokyo on tickets that she later fully refunded, according to the facts. The victim said he told Pasaribu he wanted to buy property for his parents, and she talked him into an investment opportunity involving commissions through a travel agency she claimed her family partially owned. \u2018It all seemed legitimate. In hindsight, I feel like such an idiot.\u2019 The main victim of Rina Pasaribu \u201cThe offender told [the victim] that if he transferred her a certain amount of money, [he] would later receive a multiple of that amount as a return on his investment,\u201d the facts state. \u201cThe commission-based incentive scheme did not exist.\u201d\n\nHe transferred more than $520,000 over 75 transactions, and received about $40,000 back. The victim said he had \u201ctotally believed and trusted\u201d Pasaribu. \u201cIt all seemed legitimate,\u201d he said. \u201cIn hindsight, I feel like such an idiot.\u201d He described it as a \u201cnightmare of a situation\u201d, feeling the stress had impacted the health of his mother, who died suddenly this year, months before his father died from cancer. \u201cThe person she [Mum] almost trusted most was a con artist,\u201d the victim said.\n\nHis mental health was affected, and he suffered from major depression, a relationship breakdown and being unable to work. \u201cI ... lost absolutely everything,\u201d he said. Taking down a conwoman Between April 2022 and October 2023, Pasaribu held herself out as someone who \u201ccould obtain airline tickets at a price substantially below the normal market price\u201d, court documents state. \u201cDuring this period, the offender was not employed by Singapore Airlines and was not able to obtain discounted airfares.\u201d\n\nPasaribu\u2019s main victim said she \u201cstrategically kept everyone apart\u201d, and would speak poorly to his mother about others in the TAFE class. He said Pasaribu suddenly \u201cignored, blocked us all and disappeared\u201d, telling them she had a relative who was dying in hospital. They went to the hospital, but found no one there. \u201cThat was confirmation it was a scam,\u201d he said. He said the fraud unravelled further at a group gathering when they found out \u201cit\u2019s all Rina\u201d. \u201cThe next thing was to find Rina,\u201d he said.\n\nRina Pasaribu is due to face a sentence hearing on Thursday over the fraud. Credit: NSW Police As they pursued Pasaribu, the victim and his mother found her parents and \u201ctold them everything\u201d. \u201cShe knew we were tracking her down. We effectively found her and had her hand herself in.\u201d On December 28, 2023, Pasaribu attended Surry Hills police station and was arrested and charged. The victim said the crime was senseless, particularly given the personal, financial and legal risks Pasaribu was exposing herself to. He recalled the case of conwoman Melissa Caddick, who vanished from her Dover Heights home in 2020. Only Caddick\u2019s foot has been found.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d he said of Pasaribu\u2019s case. \u201cI definitely underestimated the power of a gambling addiction.\u201d He said he was \u201cstill financially ruined\u201d and wanted the case to be over so he can begin to heal. He hoped Pasaribu would be jailed, stating: \u201cYou just can\u2019t let someone like that roam the streets.\u201d \u2018Crippling addiction\u2019 and a \u2018cancer diagnosis\u2019 A former partner of Pasaribu\u2019s previously told the court he knew she had a \u201ccrippling addiction to gambling for over 20 years\u201d and needed help to \u201ccure this insidious illness\u201d. \u201cThis disease has driven her to resort to unfathomable desperation and made her commit fraud offences in the past to feed this addiction,\u201d he said in a letter filed to the NSW Supreme Court at her bail application last year, when she was granted release to a rehabilitation facility.\n\nThe court, at the time, heard Pasaribu had served four terms of imprisonment since 2005 for fraud. The main victim in her current case said he was \u201ccompletely unaware\u201d of her criminal and custodial history. Pasaribu pleaded guilty in February to 12 counts of dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception and is due to face a sentence hearing in the NSW District Court this week. During a case mention in April, Judge Stephen Hanley said he had been advised Pasaribu had been diagnosed with cancer. But given the nature of the offences, the judge said he would like it clarified Pasaribu was \u201cactually suffering from that illness\u201d. Defence lawyer Tal Gilead tendered a letter about Pasaribu\u2019s breast cancer diagnosis, and told the court his client \u201cdoesn\u2019t quite know what the prognosis is at this stage\u201d.",

Bezos's fame and Venice's stunning visual backdrop have offered them international visibility which they effectively exploited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No Space for Bezos\" banners draped over the iconic Rialto Bridge and a huge canvas laid out on St Mark's Square urging the tech billionaire to pay more taxes have been seen all over the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerns of greater disruptions forced Bezos and his bride to move their final and biggest celebrity party from the central district to a more isolated venue in the eastern part of the lagoon city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea that the city should be seen as a set, a stage, or an amusement park has been highlighted like never before by Bezos' wedding,\" Tommaso Cacciari, a frontman for the No Space for Bezos movement, said.\n\n\n\nA thousand protesters from social centres and environmental associations participated in the demonstration against the exploitation of the city and marched through the streets. Source: SIPA USA / Roberto Brancolini In the final protest on Saturday (local time), around 1,000 residents and activists rallied in front of Venice's train station under a scorching sun, before marching roughly 1.5 kilometres to the Rialto Bridge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bezos, out of the lagoon\", the demonstrators chanted as they wound through the city centre, some brandishing signs that read: \"Eat the rich\", \"Rejected\", and accusations that Venice's mayor is \"corrupt\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOne banner proclaimed \"Kisses yes, Bezos no\", playing on Venice's reputation as the city of love, and another one said \"No space for Bezos\" with a rocket, in a reference to his Blue Origin space technology company.\n\n\n\n\n\nVenetian businesses and politicians, however, welcomed the event, hailing its major boost for the local economy. Luca Zaia, the regional governor of Veneto around Venice, said the city should be proud of hosting the wedding.\n\n\n\nProtesters demand affordable housing, oppose overtourism\n\nAlice Bazzoli, a 24-year-old university student, called Bezos a \"hypocrite\" for donating 3 million euros ($5.38 million) to Venice while flooding its fragile ecosystem with high-polluting private jets and yachts.\n\n\n\n\n\nBezos and Sanchez have given 1 million euros ($1.79 million) each to three Venetian institutions: CORILA, an academic consortium that studies the lagoon, UNESCO's local office, and Venice International University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd love Venice to be tailored for citizens, not for tourists, with affordable housing,\" Bazzoli said, complaining that students were being priced out of the market, with the best accommodations offered to visitors.\n\n\n\nThe 'Moa' boat transporting Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez Bezos is escorted on the Grand Canal, on the third day of their wedding festivities. Source: AFP / Marco Bertorello Andrea Segre, a 49-year-old Italian film director born in Venice, said the city was also pushing out ordinary residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People aged 25 to 35 \u2014 the age group that starts families \u2014 cannot afford to live in Venice. The consequence is a lack of diversity and social liveliness,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nVenice is rapidly depopulating, largely because of the cost of living crisis. Its historic city centre now has fewer than 50,000 residents, compared to more than 100,000 some 50 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe city has hosted scores of other VIP weddings, including that of actor George Clooney and human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014, but the latest luxury nuptials have attracted far greater resentment because of Bezos' corporate and political role.\n\n\n\nJeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez leave the Aman Hotel on the third day of their wedding festivities.

Reuters news agency reported in February that Italian prosecutors were investigating alleged tax evasion worth 1.2 billion ($2.15 billion) euros.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would have protested against Bezos even if he had come on a rowboat with just a handful of people ... because he contributed practically, materially and politically to Donald Trump's re-election,\" protest leader Cacciari said.\n\n\n\n",

But her response was much sadder than Xu had expected, which broke her heart.\n\n\n\n\n\nBorn in Melbourne to two Chinese migrants, Xu was close to her mum growing up. Her dad died when she was 13, leaving her mother to raise her and her elder brother solo.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as Xu began to embrace her most authentic self in her late teens, the pain of being cut off from her mother added to the grief of having lost her father.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was the most painful thing of my life. I can't imagine ever going through that again,\" she says.\n\n\n\nYoung Chinese Australian Lucy Xu (pictured left as a child) says going no contact with her mother after coming out was the most painful period of her life. Source: Supplied / Lucy Xu The 24-year-old publishing and editing postgraduate student is one of many young Chinese Australians who struggle to balance being their authentic selves with being 'good' children to their first-generation Chinese Australian parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe explains the conflict stems from the divide between generally progressive values held by young Chinese Australians and the more traditional values often held by their parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor LGBTIQ+ young people like Xu, that divide can be particularly personal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I don't have my mum in my life, then it's kind of like I'm just floating around,\" she tells Chinese-ish, an SBS podcast exploring the daily life of young Chinese people in Australia .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think also being Asian Australian, growing up in Australia, especially surrounded by a lot more majoritively white communities, you kind of feel like you exist in this third space where you are Australian, but you're not really, and you are Chinese, but you're also not really.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it feels like when you lose something, it's so much more impactful because you already didn't have as much as someone else who was white growing up in Australia.\"\n\n\n\nLucy Xu (pictured as a child) wants to embrace her authentic self with the support of her Chinese-Australian family. Source: Supplied / Lucy Xu\n\nFamily therapy and a letter\n\nOne year after her mum first cut contact, Xu decided to reach out to her and proposed an unusual request: they go to therapy together.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer mother had previously attended counselling sessions to process the loss of her husband, Xu's father. Understanding the benefits of talk therapy, she agreed to the request.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut finding the right therapist proved a challenging task for Xu, as her mother speaks Mandarin. While Xu can speak a little, she's not fluent. She also wasn't sure where to find therapists specialising in LGBTIQ+ mental health support while understanding intergenerational cultural dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I just googled 'Asian therapists who are in LGBTQ groups in Melbourne' and it came out with the contact of a Malaysian therapist who's also a gay man,\" she says.\n\n\n\nTo reconcile with her mother after coming out as a lesbian, Lucy Xu invited her mother to go to family therapy together. Source: Supplied / Lucy Xu Xu says the therapist \u2014 who speaks both Mandarin and English \u2014 has been key to helping her express feelings about her sexuality and communicate with her mother.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore embarking on a six-month therapy journey, Xu wrote a letter to her mother. In it, she tells her that she loves her and hopes she will come to accept her for who she is, saying: \"I love myself and know myself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just remember afterwards she had a lot more questions for me about my sexuality,\" Xu says.\n\n\n\nSo she wanted to understand more and know more about this part of me, which I was really grateful for\n\n\"She was much more open talking about the topic with me, even if she didn't fully accept it.\"\n\n\n\nGrowing up in a bilingual household, Lucy Xu (second from right) says it was challenging to figure out the exact words to use when coming out to her mother. Source: Supplied / Lucy Xu\n\n'This is who I am'\n\nWhen coming out as gay and queer to his family, Hong Kong-Australian filmmaker Victor Wu also wrote a letter to his parents, who both worked for Hong Kong's education department before arriving in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just kind of spelled out exactly how I felt, what my position was, which was that I was not asking for approval, I was not asking for acceptance,\" the 39-year-old says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[I wrote that] this is who I am. Their decision is whether they accept it, but their decision affects whether they have a place in my life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith support from his elder sibling, Wu's parents eventually accepted his identity and started noticing stereotypes perpetuated against LGBTIQ+ people within certain parts of the Chinese-speaking expat community.\n\n\n\nHong Kong Australian filmmaker Victor Wu (pictured right, as a child) says he wrote a letter to his parents when coming out as gay and queer. Source: Supplied / Victor Wu Over time, Wu found that, although his parents embraced his sexuality and gender identity, they would sometimes still make homophobic comments.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe explains that when his parents first arrived in Australia in 1994, they were introduced to an evangelical church that a longtime friend from Hong Kong also attended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We came back one day from church and mum was talking about how vicious the people at that church were about gay people, and how cruel they were,\" Wu says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But then she followed up saying that, 'you know, gay people are just mentally ill, they just needed to be treated'.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese conflicted views aren't uncommon within the Chinese community in Australia, Wu says, while noting progress on marriage equality and LGBTIQ+ rights more generally has made many Chinese Australians more accepting toward queer people.\n\n\n\nBut the Chinese diaspora was among the groups targeted during the 2017 Marriage Law Postal Survey, with leaflets containing misinformation about same-sex marriage that claimed it would threaten their cultural values and identities.\n\n\n\n\n\nWu says while homophobia still exists in the community, there has been a shift in terms of what people are fearful of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the past, Chinese people or parents would see homosexuality as immoral,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But now gay marriage is legal, they won't think it's immoral, but rather, they are scared of how they would be viewed if other people know their kids are gay,\" Wu says, adding his parents once expressed concern about how coming out could affect his career.\n\n\n\nIncreasing everyday visibility within community\n\nWu believes the solution to counter lingering homophobia is to increase the everyday visibility of LGBTIQ+ people from the Chinese diaspora.\n\n\n\n[It's about] seeing people in our own communities, not seeing something in the media, but seeing some people in our schools, our workmates, weekend Chinese schools \u2026 that's going to change their minds.\n\nIt's a belief that underpins Wu's latest film, To Freely Flourish, which features a Chinese-Australian teenager coming out to his family at the height of the marriage equality debate.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also wants a broader range of Chinese-focused LGBTIQ+ stories to be portrayed in Australian media and entertainment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think part of the problem is because the narratives in the media and storytelling are still so much around pain and tragedy and loss, and it's because we don't have these positive stories that queerness is equated to sadness, death, tragedy and pain,\" he says.\n\n\n\nVictor Wu says his film, To Freely Flourish, aims to counter the stigma some LGBTIQ+ Chinese Australians face. Source: Supplied / Victor Wu According to the 2021 Census, around two in 10 LGBTIQ+ Australians were born overseas, with 4.9 per cent of them speaking a language other than English at home.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving experienced the struggle of coming out in a cross-cultural setting firsthand, both Wu and Xu say getting involved with an LGBTIQ+ peer collective with shared cultural backgrounds has been helpful for them in navigating the challenges.\n\n\n\nAfter reading his letter, Victor Wu's parents decided to embrace their son's sexuality and gender identity. Source: Supplied / Victor Wu \"I think there's already people doing amazing things and leading the community, creating community \u2026 but we're not going to really learn about them as household names till much later,\" Wu says.\n\n\n\nHow to prepare for 'the talk'\n\nBefore broaching a conversation about sexuality or gender identity with parents, Ryan Qian from the health organisation for people of diverse sexualities and genders, ACON's peer education program, says it's important to know that coming out isn't \"necessary\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It feels like a social pressure to put on you that you have to come out, and it has to be a grounded thing,\" he says.\n\n\n\nThese things take time, and it's not just for you but also for your parents \u2014 some people can prepare for months or years.\n\nFor those considering coming out to their parents, Qian suggests joining a culturally specific LGBTIQ+ peer support group to navigate the balance between pursuing personal authenticity and maintaining cultural roots.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO After Marriage Equality: Growing Up Queer with Chinese Parents SBS English 25/06/2025 27:00 English\n\nQian says writing a letter can also be helpful for young people from multicultural backgrounds in communicating sensitive and personal matters with their parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Coming out has such a great impact when it comes to you and your family. It's a great challenge if you don't know how your parents are going to react, and sometimes language can be lost in translation,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe stresses it's important to have a backup plan and prepare for adverse reactions before having the talk, such as researching emergency housing and counselling services to support the potential fallout with family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Having a support network is essential before you come out.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Key Points 3D printing new homes can improve construction times by 40 per cent, compared to building with traditional methods.\n\nAustralia has seen single-storey 3D printed homes constructed, but the first such multi-storey home is being built.\n\nWith supply of new housing at its lowest in nearly a decade, there's hope this method will assist in meeting demand.\n\nAt first glance, a construction site in Melbourne's outer-western suburbs looks like any other. But there's one huge difference: the house isn't being built traditionally \u2014 it's printed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe property in the suburb of Wyndham is set to be Australia's first multi-storey 3D-printed home .\n\n\n\nHow do you print a house?\n\nPrinting a house starts the same way as building one, with a drawing from a draftsperson or architect.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut then things take a different turn.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe property's blueprint or drawing is fed into a printer, which creates a physical structure by printing the material in layers.\n\n\n\n\"With 3D printing, it all gets digitised... [The] working drawing goes into a printer as a geometric code, and then it gets done,\" Ahmed Mahil, the CEO of Luyten, the Melbourne-based company printing the house in Wyndham, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All the other trades will come and their jobs will be easier ... it'll become just plug and play,\" Mahil added.\n\n\n\n\"There will be no more thinking on site or trying to go from one remedy to another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That obviously saves a lot of time in terms of workflow [as] it's just one material that you're dealing with.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the builder, the entire process of building \"80 per cent of the house\" in Wyndham took approximately three weeks.\n\n\n\nA solution to the housing crisis?\n\nThis is not the only 3D-printed home in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust last month, two single-storey homes were built in the New South Wales town of Dubbo as part of a 3D-printed social housing project.\n\n\n\nTechnology now allows a property's blueprint to be digitised and 'built' in layers, using a large-scale 3D printer. Source: Supplied / guteksk7/Getty Images With the average build time for a stand-alone home having increased by 40 per cent, according to Master Build Australia, developers say this technology could be a faster solution for countries facing a housing crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes as the supply of new housing falls to its lowest level in nearly a decade, according the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council report in May.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report said 177,000 new homes were finished in 2024, a big gap from the estimated underlying demand of 223,000 for the same period.\n\n\n\nMahil believes 3D-printed homes could be the answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I believe [they] will contribute significantly to reducing the issue with supply,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're talking about increasing the efficiency and the productivity ... A traditional builder does 10 houses a year. We can up that to 50 houses.\"\n\n\n\nA more sustainable option?\n\nSome experts consider the 3D printing method to be a more sustainable alternative to traditional processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are really big benefits to 3D printing and sustainability in construction,\" Kate Dunn, an academic at UNSW, told SBS News.\n\n\n\nAhmed Mahil says printing this 3D house cost 30 per cent less than a traditional construction. Credit: Supplied \"One of the biggest benefits is [that] you use way less material than you do in traditional construction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"3D printing gives us the opportunity to create quite customised forms that use substantially less concrete than traditional methods. So that's where the environmental impact happens, that reduction in material.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n3D-printed homes are also considered to be more affordable than traditionally built homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nMahil claims his 3D-printed house cost 30 per cent less than a traditional build. However, there's been no official Australian research into the cost difference.\n\n\n\n'Industry shock' on human labour\n\nDespite the benefits, others worry the use of technology may reduce the demand for human labour.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to 2023 research by academics at Charles Darwin and Monash universities, the 3D technologies will \"reduce opportunities for many people working onsite\", which \"may cause political instability in particular economies\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why Australian homes are so cold \u2014 and what you can do about it\n\nHao Wu, an academic in Melbourne University's faculty of architecture, says the construction industry will have to adapt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The existing work-relation industry structure may be impacted [by] it and maybe gradually transform,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In some cases, it could be a industry shock.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Mahil suggests the new technology will help smaller businesses keep up with rising demand.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australians are used to \"pumping gas\" to heat their homes during winter, but homeowners willing to make their properties more energy-efficient are saving almost $1,000 a month on their mortgages.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, Melbourne resident Amanda Fung shaved 0.75 percentage points off her interest rate after installing a split-system air conditioner and switching from gas to an induction stove. She also replaced her hot water system a few months prior.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the works cost thousands of dollars, some banks are now offering low-interest rate loans to Australians to help pay for such upgrades. In Fung's case, making her home more energy-efficient also made her eligible for a cheaper interest rate on her home loan.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why Australian homes are so cold \u2014 and what you can do about it\n\nMortgage broker Marisa Hoffenberg, founder of Sustainable Home Loans, says many Australians are not aware of the cost savings that efficiency upgrades can deliver, or the availability of green loans to help cover the upfront costs. Many banks are also offering cheaper home loans to those with more energy-efficient properties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is such a huge advantage,\" Hoffenberg says, adding that it's \"devastating\" that more people don't know about the offers.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says clients can save around $100,000 in interest payments over the life of their loan, but she has also worked with homeowners who are on track to save $80,000 within five years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's almost an absolute no-brainer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHoffenberg says the lack of advertising about green loans is partly to blame for the lack of awareness among consumers, but the assessments required to prove a home's energy efficiency can also be difficult to obtain.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there are hopes that this will change with the federal government looking to expand the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS), which is currently used to assess the energy efficiency of new homes, to also apply to existing homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson from the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water says: \"The government will stage the release of NatHERS to existing homes from mid-2025.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJake Harvey, founder of 28Watt, which helps people to find the cheapest way to finance home energy upgrades, says once a standardised tool is available to assess the energy efficiency of an existing home, it will become a \"catalyst\" for more banks to offer discounted mortgages.\n\n\n\nEnergy efficiency measures can save homeowners money on their electricity bills, as well as on their mortgages. Source: SBS News Harvey points to the Netherlands, where every home is assessed and rated on its energy efficiency, and major banks tie their home loan rates to this rating. He believes all Australian homes will eventually be required to disclose energy efficiency performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nImproving the energy efficiency of homes will help reduce electricity demand, which is expected to rise overall as Australians adopt electric vehicles (EVs) and other measures to reduce carbon emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government estimates around 70 per cent of Australia's 11 million existing homes have an energy rating of three stars or lower. If this could be boosted to five stars, the energy needed for heating and cooling could drop by 40 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nState governments are also introducing measures to encourage greater energy efficiency even in rental properties. This week, the Victorian government announced that minimum efficiency standards for rental homes will be phased in from 2027, including requirements for insulation, draught-proofing, cooling in living areas, and four-star showerheads.\n\n\n\nBoosting a home's energy efficiency to five stars could also reduce the need for heating and cooling by 40 per cent. Source: SBS News\n\nWhat are green loans?\n\nThere are several different types of green loans available, and the offerings vary widely between banks.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany, including the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), offer low-interest-rate loans (for loan terms of between five and 10 years) to help fund specific measures, such as solar, batteries, and the installation of EV chargers. Other banks also offer loans for upgrades such as insulation, double glazing and split-system air conditioning.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvey says the lowest interest rate available is 2.79 per cent from RACQ, which generally requires the homeowner to have a mortgage with the bank, although not every bank will insist on this.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Solar batteries are about to get cheaper. But some existing solar panel users are sceptical\n\nNavigating the different offers between banks is one reason Harvey says installers of solar and other upgrades don't promote these loans and prefer to nudge clients towards zero-interest loan products, which are easy to explain and use.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he says installers often add a fee for these products to their quotes, so people end up paying more upfront.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[By opting for a low interest rate loan instead, homeowners are] accessing the installer's best cash price, not their inflated 0 per cent interest quote price,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvey says 28Watt was developed to help customers find the best loan to finance their energy efficiency measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomers can upload a quote from an installer and 28Watt will provide them options for a loan with the best interest rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Harvey says some lenders pay the company a small commission if they are recommended, they will always list the cheapest option first.\n\n\n\nDraughtproofing a home can reduce energy use for heating and cooling. Source: Getty / Westend61 Homeowners who improve the energy efficiency of their homes may also be eligible for discounted interest rates on their mortgage.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Bank Australia offered a 0.75 percentage point discount on its variable interest rate to customers who improved the energy efficiency of their homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was so popular, Bank Australia has now temporarily paused the product.\n\n\n\n\n\n''We had such strong demand for our Clean Energy Home Loan Renovate product that we recently had to pause new applications,\" a Bank Australia spokesperson says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were able to offer the Clean Energy Home Loan at reduced rates, partly thanks to the support of the Federal Government-backed Clean Energy Finance Corporation, who contribute to the reduced rate, with the remaining portion of the reduction at the time funded by Bank Australia.\"\n\n\n\nSaving $1,000 a month on repayments\n\nFung is one of the homeowners lucky enough to take advantage of Bank Australia's reduced interest rate for energy-efficient homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe got a 0.75 percentage discount on her interest rate, which, combined with the Reserve Bank of Australia's 0.25 percentage point cut to the cash rate in May , is now saving her almost $1,000 a month on her mortgage repayment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFung secured the loan in April after spending around $12,000 on switching from gas heating and cooking to electric options.\n\n\n\nAmanda Fung says her energy bills have not gone up despite being at home all day on maternity leave and using the heater constantly to warm her baby's room. Her husband also works from home more frequently. Source: Supplied The upgrades have not reduced the cost of Fung's electricity bills, but she says this is because she is using more power now that she's on maternity leave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm home a lot more, my husband works from home a lot more and it means we need to heat the house for longer periods of the day,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Heating in the] baby's room runs all day, all night, whereas before we wouldn't have run the heating for that long.\"\n\n\n\n'Everything feels dry and warm'\n\nDarcy Dunn says his electricity usage from the grid has dropped by 46 per cent in the five years since he started upgrading his two-bedroom house in the regional Victorian city of Geelong.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is despite switching his heating from gas to electric.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 32-year-old says he and his family did not use their previous gas heating much because they understood how energy inefficient it was to run, so they chose instead to wear four or five layers of clothing at times.\n\n\n\nThe house was really cold to the point of potentially being unhealthily cold in winter.\n\nSince doing the works, they no longer worry about how much they are using their heating. They have also managed to reduce their electricity usage because their home is more energy-efficient, although the cost of their electricity bills is roughly the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nDunn estimates he has spent almost $77,000 on works to his home over five years, including installing a 6.6kW solar system, double-glazing windows and doors, a heat pump for hot water, ceiling fans, an induction cooktop, a split system air conditioning unit, and insulation in the walls, ceiling, and floors.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the biggest drops in their electricity usage came after installing solar in February as well as replacing their old hot water unit with a new heat pump unit, which reduced their usage by around 40 per cent.\n\n\n\nDarcy Dunn spent almost $77,000 on energy efficiency measures over the past five years. Source: SBS News The NatHERS rating of his home went from one star to 7.9 stars. Dunn says double glazing and wall insulation were crucial to achieving this result.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe works allowed him to get a reduced interest loan through Bank Australia, and he says the works have also made his house feel less damp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everything feels dry and warm,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the old house, because it got so cold and was also so leaky, everything [felt] a bit damp and moist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Coming home after a day where there's been no heating on in the house, you walk in and it's still quite comfortable.\"\n\n\n\nWhat are the challenges?\n\nWhile a lack of knowledge about green loans is one reason they are not more widespread, Hoffenberg says they have also been difficult to access due to difficulties in proving eligibility.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says some banks like the CBA previously only gave discounted mortgage rates to people who could achieve a green star rating by the Green Building Council of Australia, but this rating process is incredibly expensive, making it unaffordable for many homeowners.\n\n\n\nWe've had a number of products being put out into the market that have not worked for various reasons, but once they get the design of the product right, it's a phenomenal success.\n\nA spokesperson for the CBA says it has now withdrawn its Green Home Offer due to \"low take-up\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CBA will instead focus on its Home Energy Upgrades service, which offers customers personal loans with a low interest rate of 3.99 per cent to install solar, battery or EV chargers, as well as $1,500 cash back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, applications for Bank Australia's discounted mortgage have been paused due to high demand, although a spokesperson says they plan to re-open applications later in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nHoffenberg says green loans require banks to spend more time on administration, and the products can also be difficult for mortgage brokers to navigate because it's necessary to understand both the energy efficiency requirements and the loan requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Hoffenberg believes these loans will continue to be offered, although institutions like Bank Australia may change the format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's still options available, it changes all the time.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Warning: this story contains elements that may distress some people.\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many people, reporting sexual harassment at work is not as easy as simply making a complaint.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile laws are in place to prevent and eliminate sexual harassment at work, experts and victim survivors say there are still significant gaps between policy and practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the Australian Human Rights Commission says more needs to be done to support those most vulnerable to harassment at work.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Anna Cody is Australia's Sex Discrimination Commissioner.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe tells SBS that for real change to occur, leaders have to take action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we need to see is leaders stepping up. So that's CEOs, directors of boards, managers, supervisors, but everyone within a workplace to make sure that people are safe and respected at work. And how we can then create a culture where it's not okay to not be respectful within a workplace. We need to ensure that our workplaces are diverse, that there is cultural diversity, people with disability at all levels within an organisation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Commission's new report, called Speaking From Experience, aims to address gaps in understanding about what workers from diverse backgrounds think needs to change to make workplaces safer.\n\n\n\n\n\nSexual harassment at work is a complex matter and extends beyond gender discrimination, occurring most often to those who experience various forms of overlapping disadvantage or discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Harassers definitely do choose who they are harassing though they'll choose the person who's on a temporary visa or who really needs this job and who can't afford to let it go. So they use that vulnerability as a way of protecting themselves. So workplaces and bosses and supervisors need to be conscious of that, particularly where there are systems in place or locations within a workplace. You can create safety within a workplace through systems as well as through the way in which you deal with the person who's experienced workplace sexual harassment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission says one in three Australians report being sexually harassed at work.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure was far higher for some, with almost half [[48%]] of people with a disability experiencing harassment at work and 56 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in insecure employment, LGBTIQ+ people, culturally or linguistically diverse people, and people with a disability, are not only more likely to experience sexual harassment, but less likely to feel safe enough to report it.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrabha Nandagopal is an award-winning human rights lawyer and founder of Elevate Consulting Partners, a firm that works with businesses to create safe, respectful and inclusive workplaces.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says leaders must be able to address their own blind spots and centre the voices of those affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" We know that sexual harassment isn't just about gender, it's about power. And people who do sit at that intersection of racism, sexism, ableism, for example, are often more exposed and less protected. And as a woman of colour, I've seen how these layers of discrimination compound when it comes to leaders, it starts with really listening even when it's uncomfortable. So I'm briefing board directors and leaders and middle management almost every day in my day job, and it's very easy for me to talk about workplace sexual harassment. But the moment you start talking about racism in the workplace, that's when there's a bit of discomfort.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile acknowledging changes to the national approach over the past decade and the greater responsibility placed on employers, experts say policy and practice gaps still exist.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing from the experience of over 300 victim-survivors of workplace sexual harassment, the report emphasises the need for people to feel safe enough to report.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2022, a legal obligation called Positive Duty was added to the Sex Discrimination Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the obligation, employers have a duty to eliminate and prevent, as far as possible, unlawful acts of sexual harassment at work.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrabha Nandagopal says she supports recommendations to impose civil penalties for companies failing to comply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The positive duty regime under the Federal Sex Discrimination Act doesn't have civil penalties attached to it. So if someone doesn't comply with the commission's compliance notice that organization can be taken to the federal court. Where the federal court can make any order it sees fit. But unlike say your work health and safety regime, the commission's enforcement powers are quite limited.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkplace sexual harassment also extends beyond the physical workplace: it's not only harmful psychologically but can isolate individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Shih Joo Tan is a professor of criminology at the University of Melbourne and has co-authored a series of reports on the experiences of migrant and refugee women with workplace harassment.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says aside from uncertainty around their rights, people from diverse cultural backgrounds are often dismissed as misunderstanding Australian culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For example, some migrant and refugee women might be on an employer-sponsored visa, which would sit very hard for them to even report or think about reporting because they would then have to consider the consequences that it could have on their visa status or which also links to their right to remain in a country. So there's that. And also the other issue that was also mentioned in the report was that a lot of times when they do try to say that this is what happened to me, or this person had said this really horrible thing to me, often the response that they could get is that this is just a joke or this is part of the Australian culture, learn how to, you just need to learn Australian culture in that way. So it was seen as a problem on their part that there was a lack of understanding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother issue raised in the report was the lack of knowledge around different forms of harassment.\n\n\n\n\n\nOften mistaken as only the most blatant forms of harassment, sexual harassment in the workplace can be covert and is often dismissed as something more lighthearted.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Anna Cody says without proper understanding of what sexual harassment is, employers can't properly address it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There have been significant changes over the last decade coming out of the Me Too movement and a greater understanding of workplace sexual harassment. But we still need to build our understanding of what constitutes workplace sexual harassment. So while many people understand touching, unwanted sexual touching, to be workplace sexual harassment, we need to think about messaging of sexual content or of leering or staring at someone in a sexual way or suggesting sexual acts with that person. All of those things also constitute workplace sexual harassment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report offers policymakers and organisations eleven key recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the recommendations centre around reducing barriers - barriers to information, to safety, to being heard, to accessing support, and to justice and accountability.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Tan says while many people never make a formal complaint, there were certain things people say made it easier when they did.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the very first instance, most of them felt comfortable and secure with their direct supervisors. So there was immediate support from management level. The other thing was also assurance that this would not impact on their visa status or their financial security, or that they would not have to face small talk in the office, which was another thing that women had talked about as impacting on their mental wellbeing and things that they would consider as impacting on their positions. They felt like they were punished on a social level for speaking up or for complaining.\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Nandagopal says employers need to take the time to understand the problems specific to their workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So firstly, it's about really understanding the nature and prevalence of sexual harassment in their workplace by speaking to their workers and consulting, particularly those from marginalised groups, not only about what they're experiencing, but asking what they need to feel safe. Then investing in real quality education and training for leaders and workers. And then ensuring their policies and reporting processes are trauma informed and culturally safe. So going beyond that tick-a-box approach to really investing in quality effective measures to prevent and respond to sexual harassment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCommissioner Anna Cody says the landmark report is a crucial final step in the Commission's Respect at Work agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while there is still a long way to go as the recommendations are considered, she says it's important to appreciate the work of victim survivors in telling their stories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The people that we heard from, how strong and determined they were in trying to make our workplaces fairer and safer for everyone, that they wanted to share their stories so that we could act on them and ensure that other people didn't have to go through what they had gone through.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nNayran Tabiei keeps busy in the kitchen making traditional Syrian dishes for her catering business in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this week, her thoughts were far away, worrying about her three sons in Iran\u2019s capital Tehran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The mobile is cut, the line they cut - no news at all. My heart started to beat. I didn't sleep at all. I tried every night, every day I'm trying to message and you see 100 message in my mobile but no answer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs bombs rained down on the city, Ms Tabiei could only hope her boys - aged in their 20s \u2013 had survived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm boiling from inside because the thing - when nothing in your hand and nothing you can do. You just, y\u2019know you want to help. My heart start like where we go, what do we do? And I cannot give them any money. I cannot give them any support, even call.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Tabiei is married to an Iranian man and the couple fled Syria in 2012 with their young daughter, leaving three young sons with their grandmother in Tehran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I make bad decision. I felt so bad. I cannot believe 14 years gone I didn't see them and it's hard for a mum to see them grown up without them beside me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nArriving in Australia as an asylum seeker, Ms Tabiei later opened a small caf\u00e9 called Flavours of Syria, offering work and training to many, like herself, who were forcibly displaced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hundreds and hundreds of asylum seekers, I help them open their business and start up. It makes me proud. I'm so happy in Australia and sharing my food and culture.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, just days ago, Ms Tabiei had the phonecall she hoped for \u2013 from her sons who are alive and well, having fled Tehran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My boy called me, my heart beating - yeah good! They stay in the mountain. They took a room with their friend and when they called I am like \u2018Oh thank God, they are alive!\u2019\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Tabiei wants to reunite her family but says every effort to bring her sons here has so far failed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From the day I heard that crisis in Iran I sent all the parliament that I need help. My hearts shaken and I need my children beside me. In this moment we need help. And 14 year I didn't see them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a further loss, rising costs have also forced her to close her Syrian caf\u00e9 in Melbourne\u2019s St Kilda.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's hard to pay the rent and the cost so high. Before we had plenty of girls in the kitchen, but now I cannot afford to hire.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd she\u2019s not alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent data from credit reporting agency CreditorWatch shows that 10 per cent of all Australian hospitality businesses closed down over the past year.\n\n\n\n\n\nCEO Patrick Coghlan explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are being hit from all sides. Obviously, consumer discretionary spend is down, cost of labour, cost of goods, et cetera, all increasing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom next week, a raft of new costs will add to the pressures, according to Luke Achterstraat, CEO of the Council of Small Business Organisations, or COSBOA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As of one July, the award rate goes up three and a half percent. The super guarantee increases by 0.5 per cent. So that's 4 per cent already on the wage stack. And don't forget, on top of that you have payroll tax.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Achterstraat says more help is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's the toughest operating environment in recent memory. For a small business with revenue of up to $20 million per year, we are calling for the corporate tax rate to be slashed from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most recent Consumer Price Index ,or CPI, shows inflation sitting at 2.1 per cent in the 12 months to May.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreditorwatch CEO Patrick Coghlan says the new figure offers fresh hope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've seen two rate cuts already. They're the biggest drivers of economic activity, of GDP, of spending both from consumer and commercial. And we're expecting a couple of more of those this year as well. So, the trend is certainly heading in the right direction.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAny interest rate relief is too late for Ms Tabiei, who shut her caf\u00e9 to focus on a lower-cost catering business.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping busy is a labour of love, she says, and cooking distracts from other worries.\n\n\n\n",

Wednesday\u2019s solo recital affirmed Lang Lang\u2019s great affinity with the romantic repertory in a program underlining poetics, rather than pyrotechnics.\n\nFaure\u2019s beloved Pavane was treated almost too delicately with whispered phrases and half-lit sonorities. Schumann\u2019s Kreisleriana, arguably one of his least approachable works, sprang to life with vividly etched contrasts between aching melodic outpourings and frenetic, fiery outbursts. Traversing a dozen Chopin Mazurkas, Lang Lang illuminated the huge variety of moods and styles the composer was able to achieve in this rhythmically lopsided dance form. Among their sometimes-playful perversity, the melancholy sensuality of the A minor, Op. 17 stood out for its meltingly beautiful timbre. Pianist Lang Lang with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Credit: Nico Keenan The official program ended in a blaze of glory with the imposing Polonaise in F-sharp minor, Op. 44, before encores that included a diaphanous account of Debussy\u2019s Clair de lune and a truly incendiary reading of de Falla\u2019s Ritual Fire Dance. Saturday\u2019s breathtaking account of Saint-Saens\u2019 Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra was more in keeping with Lang Lang\u2019s rock star image. A strange amalgam of styles, the concerto was once described as \u201cbeginning with Bach and ending with Offenbach\u201d.\n\nLoading After the dramatic opening with its baroque overtones and the amusing, nonchalant scherzo, the blinding virtuosity of the tarantella finale left many wondering how anyone could play so fast and so accurately. Images of a fluttering hummingbird came to mind. This seemingly superhuman\n\ntalent, the stuff of lasting memories, unsurprisingly elicited a rapturous ovation. Two encores, Liszt\u2019s Liebestraum No. 3 and the Disney tune Who\u2019s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf? were strange bedfellows. Bookending the concert, chief conductor Jaime Mart\u00edn revelled in the festive Spanish air of Ravel\u2019s Alborada del gracioso, graced with perfectly judged bassoon cameos by Elise Millman. Mussorgsky\u2019s Pictures at an Exhibition in Ravel\u2019s wondrous orchestration was supported by lustrous string tone and cohesive, strongly characterised playing throughout the orchestra. Among the solos, Owen Morris\u2019s rapid-fire trumpet impressed. The rousing solemnity of The Great Gate of Kyiv seemed a timely and fitting conclusion. Hopefully, those who came to witness Lang Lang\u2019s technical brilliance went away from these concerts realising that he is a well-rounded romantic, whose art is both dazzling and deeply empathetic. For that, he really does deserve a rock star reception.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nJem Cassar-Daley \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nNorthcote Social Club, June 28 These are golden days for feeling blue. The Northcote Social Club was thoroughly charmed on Saturday night by the collective heartbreak of three charismatic Gen Z songwriters singing a big, sad world of everyday calamities while positively beaming with the first rush of being heard. Jem Cassar-Daly at the Northcote Social Club. Credit: Richard Clifford Anxiety is the confessed bete noir of Belgian expat Romanie. She silenced the early arrivals with a finger-picked electric guitar, impish banter and songs drawing on the agonies of Palestine, climate grief and fragile hope. They played like first drafts of raw experience, roaring with a voice that threatened to scream and ultimately did. An even fresher voice from rural New South Wales, Mikayla Pasterfield opened with her TikTok breakthrough Damage You Still Do \u2013 an assured first dip into a well of childhood guilt, unrequited love and worldly resilience. Her pealing giggle between songs brought ample light, even to that intriguingly loaded one about buying a goldfish, Tactile.\n\nSteeped from birth in old-school stagecraft and grit, Jem (daughter of Troy) Cassar-Daley upped the energy with a slick bass-drums-guitar trio and a gushing dedication to her \u201cincredible\u201d sisters in song before throwing herself into the last night of her Kiss Me Like You\u2019re Leaving tour. From the post-romantic inner monologue of Slow Down to the homesick airline stationery letter Space Between, her songs mine a consistent emotional register: sharp-focus country-pop ballads laced with the genre\u2019s traditional sighs of longing and brave-faced disappointment. As a writer, she\u2019s moving fast. Changes was an oldie from the 2022 debut album that she\u2019s all but left behind. The paint was barely dry on Tidal Wave and one or two others, even if it took a couple of inspirational covers \u2014 Gwen Stefani, Addison Rae \u2014 to bring any real sonic surprise. Mikayla Pasterfield returned to make a seamless duet of Texas Ain\u2019t That Far, Is It Dear?, the sheer joy of communion making the song\u2019s fundamental melancholy evaporate like an old memory. The headliner\u2019s inevitable encore, King of Disappointment, radiated with the same sense of bliss reclaimed in the thrill of performance. For all its gentle sorrows, that joy was the glaring takeaway from this show: three stunning singers claiming a world where blokes are sidemen and women draw strength from bills stacked with more women, then laugh about it on the way to the bar. Some nights, one guitar solo is enough.\n\nReviewed by Michael Dwyer\n\nTHEATRE\n\nSuper \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nRed Stitch, until July 6 Superhero culture is dangerous because it\u2019s \u201cessentially fascism\u201d, according to Alan Moore.

At the same time, it\u2019s true that satire and subversion from within \u2013 the nerdy reality-check of Kick-Ass, say, or the cynical vision of corporatised \u201cSupes\u201d in The Boys \u2013 can act as a kind of kryptonite to the worst tendencies of the genre. Emilie Collyer\u2019s new play Super gives us a fantastically silly and strange sideswipe at the superhero tropes we\u2019ve inherited. It\u2019s a full-throttle feminist funfest that will tickle those who love the grandiose cosplay and game-changing powers of superhero stories, while dodging hypermasculinity and ultra-violence, launching a guerrilla attack on gender inequality, and celebrating female friendship into the bargain.\n\nTwo besties \u2013 Nell (Laila Thaker) and Phoenix (Lucy Ansell) \u2013 are the only members of their superpower support group, and their special abilities are drawn from a distinctly feminine arsenal. Phoenix has a preternatural gift for suppressing her rage and can calm others against their will. Nell is, well, super-organised \u2013 a paragon of unpaid labour who can fast-track solutions to almost any problem. When Rae (Caroline Lee) first enters their gathering, they think she\u2019s taken a wrong turn \u2013 the AA meeting\u2019s down the hall. But the celebrity chef has a superpower of her own. She\u2019s so in touch with her own sorrow that if she bursts into tears, she can make anyone cry helplessly alongside her.\n\nIt comes in handy when the ageing star\u2019s producers threaten to dump her from her TV show: Rae weeps and wails and weaponises her victimhood until they relent. Laila Thaker as Nell \u2013 her power is being super-organised. Credit: Cameron Grant - Parenthesy Phoenix is suspicious of the new arrival \u2013 they\u2019re almost opposites of each other \u2013 but all three are determined to use their powers to do good in the world, despite the prickliness, and despite their powers coming at a physical cost (nothing special power suits can\u2019t fix, though that comes at a price, too). Soon their charity work becomes big business. Rae uses her celebrity to start a reality TV show judging whether ordinary contestants have superpowers. Phoenix gets ripped and fights against gang and domestic violence in marginalised communities. Nell turns their enterprise into a mega-corporation fuelled by big data, drastically enhancing the good they can do \u2026\n\nLoading A dystopian twist and climactic confrontation looms, as liberal aims begin to be achieved through \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 fascist means. Can they right themselves, or will they become villains and victims of their own success? Emma Valente directs an almost painfully entertaining show, featuring exaggerated, laugh-out-loud funny performances and spectacular visual gags and costumes. The examination of power isn\u2019t quite as fleshed out as you might hope, but the ending is radical in a way that restores perspective. The greatest superpower, it seems, might be the ordinary human comfort of genuine friendship.\n\nReviewed by Cameron Woodhead\n\nIMMERSIVE THEATRE\n\nThe Door in Question \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMetro West Footscray, until June 29 Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are still a source of fear, confusion and stigma. Troy Rainbow\u2019s remarkable mixed-reality immersive theatre event, The Door in Question, fights against them by opening a portal into altered perception, utilising the latest VR and interactive AI technology. The Door In Question is an immersive theatre experience using VR. Credit: Lauren Marr This is a solo trip into the labyrinth of the disordered mind. And if that sounds risky, the project is so sensitively realised that it feels unique in humanising (without remotely romanticising) what psychosis is like, inside and out. It helps that the artist has skin in the game. Rainbow\u2019s mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia \u2013 a deeply personal experience and an inspiration for the world you\u2019ll enter.\n\nAudiences first step into an antechamber that serves as a meditation room. A few deep breaths are needed before donning a VR headset in a Footscray shopping mall and stepping down the rabbit hole. A colourful, disturbing wonderland awaits, based on a childhood story Rainbow\u2019s mother wrote for him. Disorienting voices guide you through gritty urban landscapes, decrepit domestic environments, and a world based on classical mythology \u2013 statues of Medusa, fountains, ancient Greek columns \u2013 and onwards and upwards into a florid brush with divinity \u2026 or paranoid delusion. Disorienting voices guide you through decrepit domestic environments in The Door in Question. Credit: Lauren Marr You\u2019re inducted into a secret history of Footscray (including its Indigenous history) as you walk the streets to a second location, and I don\u2019t want to spoil what happens there. The less you know, the better, though I can say it\u2019s a full-body experience. The show will quite literally make your spine tingle, twisting the design surprises and interactive mystery of immersive theatre and escape rooms towards a higher purpose.\n\nIn fact, it almost portrays mental illness as a kind of escape room\u2026 one with no escape, and a profusion of clues everywhere you look. Each space is engagingly designed, and there\u2019s a haunting quality to the voice acting and the polyphonic script, some of which sounds as if taken verbatim from people with schizophrenia.\n\nHallucinatory audiovisual tricks keep you on edge, painfully vigilant, and one section involves a responsive AI program, as a grandiose delusion tightens its grip. Loading Exploring psychosis through mixed reality tech is a fabulous idea, and The Door in Question really does feel at the forefront of a brave new kind of artmaking. But it\u2019s the human element that makes it work \u2013 the profound authenticity of lived experience, and the unflinching insight into the danger and distress, as well as the wildcard beauty \u2013 and, yes, the love \u2013 amid the deranged tangle of psychotic illness.\n\nReviewed by Cameron Woodhead\n\nMUSIC\n\nACO Unleashed, \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nAustralian Chamber Orchestra, Hamer Hall, June 22 Undaunted by the withdrawal of injured Moldovan violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja from its current tour, the Australian Chamber Orchestra (ACO) took the opportunity to draw soloists from its own ranks in a program confirming all its appealing strengths. Anna da Silva Chen plays with the Australian Chamber Orchestra as part of ACO Unleashed. In the absence of artistic director Richard Tognetti, longstanding violinists Helena Rathbone and Satu Vanska shared direction of the orchestra. They were joined by the ACO\u2019s newest member, Anna da Silva Chen, in a buoyant account of Bach\u2019s Concerto for Three Violins. Clearly delighting in their collaboration, they wove the music\u2019s contrapuntal strands into a richly detailed tapestry, abetted by the ACO\u2019s customary rhythmic drive. Vanska brought an edgy bravura to Bernard Rofe\u2019s arrangement of Ravel\u2019s Tzigane to which the presence of the celesta in the accompanying forces contributed an additional exotic touch.\n\nLoading Exemplary ensemble and beauty of tone graced Tognetti\u2019s arrangement of Beethoven\u2019s String Quartet in F minor, Op. 95 \u201cSerioso\u201d. Nuanced variations of texture reinforced both the original\u2019s urgency and intimacy. Schubert\u2019s Quartet Movement in C minor, D. 703 shimmered like a jewel, full of light and shade, where dramatic and lyrical elements were held in admirable balance. Giving the Melbourne premiere of Jaakko Kuusisto\u2019s Cello Concerto, principal cellist Timo-Veikko Valve gave a passionate tribute to the late composer, a longtime family friend and fellow Finn. Kuusisto, who died of brain cancer in 2022, aged 48, conceived this well-crafted work with Valve\u2019s considerable technical and expressive prowess in mind. Like Sibelius, Kuusisto often sets his emotional lyricism in sparse surroundings. Here, some percussion freshened the orchestral palette, further enticing the listener\u2019s close attention. Empathetically supported by his fellow players, Valve\u2019s advocacy of this score may well make it a 21st-century classic.",

        "text": "\u201cThe development of GLP-1 and incretin-based drugs has revolutionised the space. It has carved out the biggest class of drugs ever. And it has the power to truly revolutionise our health-span,\u201d said Associate Professor Garron Dodd, head of the Metabolic Neuroscience Research Laboratory at the University of Melbourne and founder of Gallant Bio, which is developing its own obesity drugs. \u201cIt\u2019s a glorious dawn, but it\u2019s just the start.\u201d Garron Dodd, head of the Metabolic Neuroscience Research Laboratory at the University of Melbourne, is also founder of Gallant Bio. Credit: Chris Hopkins Weight loss in a pill Much as our eyes and ears sense the world and send data to our brains, our digestive tracts need ways of sending back data on what they are eating, and how much. They do this, in part, by secreting various chemical signals \u2013 hormones. Glucagon-like peptide-1 is secreted by the intestines and triggers the pancreas to produce insulin. The first GLP-1 drugs took advantage of this to become powerful treatments for diabetes.\n\nBut GLP-1 has much wider effects beyond blood-sugar control. Receptors for the hormone spread throughout the body, even in the brain, where they trigger a feeling of fullness and decrease appetite. A once-weekly dose of semaglutide, plus lifestyle changes, led volunteers in a phase 3 trial to lose 14.9 per cent of their body weight over 15 months. GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy essentially copy that human hormone. That makes them fragile. They need to be kept refrigerated, and injected subcutaneously rather than taken by mouth \u2013 as the stomach\u2019s acid would quickly break them down. An oral version of semaglutide has been developed, but only 1 per cent of the drug actually makes its way to the target receptors, and it appears less effective than the injectable version for weight loss. Loading Researchers at Japan\u2019s Chugai Pharmaceutical Co figured out a way around this problem. They designed a small molecule that can bind to the same receptor as GLP-1 and trigger it. It mimics the effect without mimicking the structure. \u201cIt\u2019s a development I never would have thought feasible,\u201d said Professor Michael Horowitz, a University of Adelaide researcher who authored a commentary on the drug in the Lancet. Chugai licensed the molecule to US-based Eli Lilly in 2018. Last week, the company reported participants on the highest dose in a clinical trial lost 7.9 per cent of their body weight over 40 weeks.\n\nThe full details of the trial have not yet been reported, and whether the weight loss is maintained over the longer term is unclear. More than a quarter of patients reported diarrhoea, 16 per cent nausea and 14 per cent vomiting. The preliminary results are \u201cclose enough to broadly call it similar\u201d to semaglutide, said Professor Jonathan Shaw, who led the Australian arm of Lilly\u2019s trial at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can confidently say it\u2019s better or worse. It\u2019s definitely in the same ballpark.\u201d It\u2019s also not known if the drug will offer the range of other benefits that GLP-1 inhibitors provide in addition to weight loss, like reductions in cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer\u2019s risk (and maybe even addictive behaviours). Horowitz said the efficacy data was promising, but he wanted to see more information about adverse effects, which he said were understated generally across semaglutide trials because they relied on patients to report their own side effects. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t served the interests of pharma to quantify how well this is tolerated.\u201d Pfizer was developing a similar once-daily GLP-1 pill but cancelled the program in April after a patient in a clinical trial suffered liver damage.\n\nA pill should, theoretically, be cheaper and easier to make than an injector \u2013 Novo Nordisk, maker of Wegovy and its diabetes drug antecedent Ozempic, has struggled to keep up with demand for semaglutide \u2013 and dramatically easier to transport. At present, the drug must be kept refrigerated right from European factories to a patient\u2019s home. \u201cThat all adds to the cost,\u201d said Shaw. There could also be cost benefits from increased competition as more drugs are approved \u2013 possibly pushing the price down far enough for governments to consider subsidising it. Lilly expects to apply for regulatory approval for the drug later this year. While orforglipron has attracted the most excitement \u2013 Eli Lilly\u2019s shares have surged since they announced the trial results \u2013 it is just one of several new drugs in late-stage development. These drugs might be of particular value to 15 per cent or so of people whose bodies do not seem to respond to semaglutide. And people don\u2019t seem to stay on the injectable drugs \u2013 less than half are still using them a year later, per a study 2024 study \u2013 despite the fact weight rebound is likely if you stop using them. \u201cIs it the injection? Is it the cost? Or is it due to adverse effects? We don\u2019t know,\u201d said Horowitz.",

Then she ... induced me to take out debt as well.\u201d He met Pasaribu in 2022 through his mother, who was also studying at TAFE in inner-city Ultimo. \u201cMum and Rina became quite good friends,\u201d he said. The main victim of Rina Pasaribu\u2019s scam said it had been a nightmare. Credit: Louie Douvis\n\n\u201cShe came over to my house for Christmas. When my dad got sick as well, she was going to the hospital. I thought of her as family. It wasn\u2019t just some \u2018random off the street\u2019 type of thing.\u201d He said Pasaribu obtained discounted laptops for people in the TAFE class and had also offered cheap flights. He travelled to Tokyo on tickets that she later fully refunded, according to the facts. The victim said he told Pasaribu he wanted to buy property for his parents, and she talked him into an investment opportunity involving commissions through a travel agency she claimed her family partially owned. \u2018It all seemed legitimate. In hindsight, I feel like such an idiot.\u2019 The main victim of Rina Pasaribu \u201cThe offender told [the victim] that if he transferred her a certain amount of money, [he] would later receive a multiple of that amount as a return on his investment,\u201d the facts state. \u201cThe commission-based incentive scheme did not exist.\u201d\n\nHe transferred more than $520,000 over 75 transactions, and received about $40,000 back. The victim said he had \u201ctotally believed and trusted\u201d Pasaribu. \u201cIt all seemed legitimate,\u201d he said. \u201cIn hindsight, I feel like such an idiot.\u201d He described it as a \u201cnightmare of a situation\u201d, feeling the stress had impacted the health of his mother, who died suddenly this year, months before his father died from cancer. \u201cThe person she [Mum] almost trusted most was a con artist,\u201d the victim said.\n\nHis mental health was affected, and he suffered from major depression, a relationship breakdown and being unable to work. \u201cI ... lost absolutely everything,\u201d he said. Taking down a conwoman Between April 2022 and October 2023, Pasaribu held herself out as someone who \u201ccould obtain airline tickets at a price substantially below the normal market price\u201d, court documents state. \u201cDuring this period, the offender was not employed by Singapore Airlines and was not able to obtain discounted airfares.\u201d\n\nPasaribu\u2019s main victim said she \u201cstrategically kept everyone apart\u201d, and would speak poorly to his mother about others in the TAFE class. He said Pasaribu suddenly \u201cignored, blocked us all and disappeared\u201d, telling them she had a relative who was dying in hospital. They went to the hospital, but found no one there. \u201cThat was confirmation it was a scam,\u201d he said. He said the fraud unravelled further at a group gathering when they found out \u201cit\u2019s all Rina\u201d. \u201cThe next thing was to find Rina,\u201d he said.\n\nRina Pasaribu is due to face a sentence hearing on Thursday over the fraud.

We effectively found her and had her hand herself in.\u201d On December 28, 2023, Pasaribu attended Surry Hills police station and was arrested and charged. The victim said the crime was senseless, particularly given the personal, financial and legal risks Pasaribu was exposing herself to. He recalled the case of conwoman Melissa Caddick, who vanished from her Dover Heights home in 2020. Only Caddick\u2019s foot has been found.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d he said of Pasaribu\u2019s case. \u201cI definitely underestimated the power of a gambling addiction.\u201d He said he was \u201cstill financially ruined\u201d and wanted the case to be over so he can begin to heal. He hoped Pasaribu would be jailed, stating: \u201cYou just can\u2019t let someone like that roam the streets.\u201d \u2018Crippling addiction\u2019 and a \u2018cancer diagnosis\u2019 A former partner of Pasaribu\u2019s previously told the court he knew she had a \u201ccrippling addiction to gambling for over 20 years\u201d and needed help to \u201ccure this insidious illness\u201d. \u201cThis disease has driven her to resort to unfathomable desperation and made her commit fraud offences in the past to feed this addiction,\u201d he said in a letter filed to the NSW Supreme Court at her bail application last year, when she was granted release to a rehabilitation facility.\n\nThe court, at the time, heard Pasaribu had served four terms of imprisonment since 2005 for fraud. The main victim in her current case said he was \u201ccompletely unaware\u201d of her criminal and custodial history. Pasaribu pleaded guilty in February to 12 counts of dishonestly obtaining financial advantage by deception and is due to face a sentence hearing in the NSW District Court this week. During a case mention in April, Judge Stephen Hanley said he had been advised Pasaribu had been diagnosed with cancer. But given the nature of the offences, the judge said he would like it clarified Pasaribu was \u201cactually suffering from that illness\u201d. Defence lawyer Tal Gilead tendered a letter about Pasaribu\u2019s breast cancer diagnosis, and told the court his client \u201cdoesn\u2019t quite know what the prognosis is at this stage\u201d.",

        "text": "Nearly 100 countries called for an ambitious global treaty to end plastic pollution at a UN ocean summit earlier this month. And these images show why.\n\nIt should be a picturesque Aussie oasis but there is one major problem plaguing this well known island. And these images show just how bad a global crisis has become.\n\nIn just a short 10 metre stretch of sand along Greta Beach on Australia's Christmas Island, volunteers found some 17,500 pieces of rubbish and marine debris washed up on the beach this week.\n\nSometimes referred to as the Galapagos of Australia, the protected area is a known hotspot for the endless stream of marine rubbish. While promoted for its inherent beauty, you don't have to go far reading the reviews on TripAdvisor to learn about the contaminating problem.\n\n\"Beautiful beach covered in ocean rubbish,\" the top review is titled.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Don\u2019t let the plastic put you off. Go there, collect a rubbish bag at the start of the track and do the environment a favour,\" another reviewer wrote.\n\n\"Rubbish I am afraid, no I mean full of rubbish,\" a third review is titled.\n\nDue to the ocean's current, the problem is overwhelming Great Beach. Source: Tangaroa Blue\n\nThe Tangaroa Blue Foundation coordinates a huge network of volunteers and uses the Australian Marine Debris Initiative to record rubbish washed up on Australian beaches. Its members were part of a team that removed a massive haul of trash from the beach this week.\n\n\"June brings huge volumes of marine debris. Despite our team\u2019s efforts, it was washing in faster than we could remove it, a stark reminder of the issue's relentless nature,\" the group said.\n\nIt's likely that just about every single piece came from another country. \"This is a global problem with local impacts that demands international action,\" it said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe ocean surrounding Christmas Island was declared a marine park in 2022, making it Australia's second largest protected area, and complementing the already established National Park more than half the island.\n\nThe group shared photos online showing the grim extent of the scourge in the otherwise gorgeous area. In the end, they collected 33 bags of debris weighing a whopping 221 kilograms.\n\nThey were joined this week by students from the Christmas Island District High School who also shared before and after photos following the extensive cleanup with that figure surging.\n\n\"We successfully removed and audited 846kg of marine debris \u2014 plus an additional 496kg of hard plastic remnant. That\u2019s a total of 1,342kg of marine pollution cleared from Greta Beach,\" the school said.\n\nThe group said it cleaned away some 17,500 bits of marine rubbish.

It wasn't really on anyone's radar back then,\" she told Yahoo.\n\n\"The goal was if we knew where it was coming from, we then knew the right stakeholder group to engage to find a practical solution\" to stop it.\"\n\nPeople who want to help are encouraged to download the Australian Marine Debris Initiative app and start cataloguing what they find.",
