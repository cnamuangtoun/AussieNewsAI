        "text": "Laine Bradley was just 10 months old when she contracted the measles - too young to be vaccinated.\n\nHer mother, Cecily Johnson, had taken her on a trip from Western Australia to Sydney.\n\n\"I didn't know there was an outbreak. If I had known I would had have had her immunised early,\" Johnson said.\n\nLaine Bradley contracted measles as a baby during a trip to Sydney. (Supplied)\n\nWhen the pair returned to Western Australia, little Laine broke out in a rash.\n\nAs a paediatric nurse, her mother immediately recognised the signs of measles.\n\nAfter a few grizzly days of being unwell, Laine recovered.\n\n\"She was fine and over it. She had no real problems. I never thought any more of it until she was seven,\" Johnson said.\n\nIt was at that age when Johnson began to think something was wrong with her daughter, but it was hard to pinpoint what exactly.\n\nLaine was naturally smart and bright girl, who even taught her brother to read and write before he went to school.\n\n\"One day she said to me, 'I can't go to school anymore. I feel dumb',\" Johnson said.\n\n\"That's when I went, oh my God, there's something wrong here.\"\n\nLaine began to show signs of confusion.\n\n\"I would say, 'Oh, come on, have a shower.' And she would answer, 'Where's the shower?'\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson said she took Laine to multiple doctors and had her seen at the hospital, but everyone told her there was nothing wrong with her daughter.\n\nIt was only when Johnson desperately appealed for help from a specialist doctor she knew that she got some answers.\n\n\"He said one thing: 'Did she have measles as a baby?'\" Johnson said.\n\nCecily Johnson with her daughter Laine when she was ill with the measles. (Supplied)\n\nLaine was diagnosed with Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare and fatal neurological disorder caused by the measles virus she contracted as an infant.\n\nWithin two weeks of her diagnosis Laine went blind, and then lost the ability to walk or speak.\n\nLaine hung on for five more years, but for much of that time she was completely bedridden and unable to do anything for herself.\n\nShe died when she was 12 in 1995.\n\nDuring Laine's illness and after her death, Johnson began sharing her story, raising important awareness about SSPE, measles and the importance of immunisation.\n\n\"If more people knew that having measles isn't just having a rash getting over it, that kids can die with it, they would make sure their kids were vaccinated,\" Johnson said.\n\nSpeaking out has made Johnson a target of anti-vaxxers who do not care to hear her message.\n\nIn an appalling move, a group of anti-vaxxers even showed up at Laine's funeral, Jonhson said, adding police officers were needed to escort them away.\n\n\"They were yelling, 'She didn't die of that, it's something else. She's a liar.'\"\n\nJohnson has had to put aside her feelings about people who oppose vaccinations when she helps children with SSPE through a support group.\n\n\"I've helped anti vaxxers when their kids have gotten ill. I put it all away, and I think of the child,\" Johnson said.\n\nWhile anti-vaccination sentiment had waxed and waned over the decades since Laine's death, Johnson said she had noticed a marked uptick since the pandemic.\n\nShe has noticed it particularly with her interactions online.\n\n\"I just had a guy laugh at Laine's photo, a dead child's photo,\" she said.\n\n\"I have to go past all the comments because they will break my heart.\"\n\nCecily Johnson nursed her daughter for 5 years before she passed away. (Supplied)\n\nJohnson is sharing Laine's story again as Australia is experiencing the highest number if measles cases in six years.\n\nSo far this year, there have been 137 cases of measles, federal health records show.\n\nThe last peak before then was back in 2019, when 284 were recorded for the full year.\n\nOn Thursday, Queensland Health issued a measles alert for South East Queensland after several cases were reported, including a school student.\n\nEarlier this month, multiple alerts have been issued across Queensland and Western Australia stemming from infected travellers returning from Bali.\n\nMeasles was considered to have been eradicated in Australia in 2014, when The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Australia free of the disease.\n\nAustralia's thorough childhood vaccination program has largely kept any subsequent outbreaks to a minimum over the intervening years.\n\nMeasles is one of the most contagious human diseases and WHO recommends at least 95 percent of the total population receive two doses of the measles vaccine in childhood to achieve \"herd immunity\".\n\nIn Australia, doses of the measles vaccine are given at 12 months and 18 months.\n\nLeading up to the pandemic, Australia had its highest level of vaccination rates ever, with 94.85 percent of 1-year-old children fully vaccinated and 92.55 percent of two-year-olds.\n\nHowever, since the pandemic that number has been steadily declining.\n\nIn 2024, there were 92.14 percent of 1-year-old's fully vaccinated and 90.44 percent of 2-year-olds.\n\nWriting in a joint piece for The Conversation last month, University of Sydney's public health associate professor Frank Beard and Katherine Macartney, a professor of Paediatrics and Child Health at the same university, said the trend was concerning.\n\n\"In terms of overall herd immunity, the impacts at this stage may be relatively small. But measles immunity gaps are much greater in some parts of Australia, such as the north coast of New South Wales and the Gold Coast in Queensland,\" the pair wrote.\n\n\"Measles immunity is also lower in some adults, because vaccination rates were lower when they were children. A second dose of measles vaccine was not added to the National Immunisation Program until 1992.\"\n\nAustralia is not the only country to see increased rates of measles. In the US, cases of measles are at their highest level since 2000, when the disease was declared eliminated there.\n\n\"Amid a global resurgence of measles and more cases in travellers, supporting international efforts to boost immunisation rates in all countries is critical. This will further reduce the chance of outbreaks here,\" Beard and Macartney said.",

        "text": "Sugarcane growers in Far North Queensland are facing the prospect of having nowhere to send their produce after next year.\n\nMossman producers have been trucking their cane to Mulgrave Mill in Gordonvale, about 100 kilometres away, since the Mossman mill shut down in early 2024 after 127 years of operation.\n\nNow they are told that the costs of hauling the cane are too high.\n\nFarmers in the Douglas Shire expect to return to the drawing board in the coming weeks to decide the future of agriculture in the region.\n\nDan Galligan, the chief executive of industry body Canegrowers, said it was a heartbreaking situation.\n\n\"There [are] multi-generational canegrowers that have been growing there and also been fighting very hard for the best part of five or six years to keep the industry going through variations of other projects and contracts,\" he said.\n\n\" This was potentially a good five-year relationship that hasn't worked out. \"\n\nDan Galligan will continue to work with Mossman farmers as they find alternatives. (Supplied: Canegrowers)\n\nMr Galligan said growers spent five years going through \"an incredibly painful and heartbreaking process\" but had not found a place to send their crops.\n\n\"Not many of them have come through for Mossman farmers, that's the reality, and it's awful \u2014 it's frankly just awful,\" he said.\n\nMr Galligan said it was time for Canegrowers to work with its members to find a way forward.\n\n\"Government has already indicated \u2013 and they have been proactive for a number of years \u2013 [it will] try and facilitate discussions around options and bring parties to the table and that will continue, and Canegrowers is no different,\" he said.\n\nToo expensive to transport\n\nMark Manganini from milling giant MSF said it was a disappointing outcome, but the economics simply did not stack up.\n\n\"It's obviously unfortunate for all concerned, because we're very keen to keep good-quality land growing sugarcane and the Mossman growers are exceptional in that,\" he said.\n\nMore than 400,000 tonnes of sugarcane from Mossman were processed at the Mulgrave mill over the last two years.\n\nMr Manganini said the average sugar factory operated within a 30-kilometre radius of its growers.\n\nSugarcane is the prominent crop in the Mossman region. (ABC Far North: Bridget Herrmann)\n\n\"The unfortunate part is the tyranny of distance makes the economics very difficult both for grower and for miller,\" he said.\n\n\"When the state government is unable to continue to fund operational costs, which is fair enough, we have to make it work between miller and grower.\n\n\" Unfortunately the commercials didn't work and we're at a point now where we won't be proceeding with that project. \"\n\nThe state government committed more than $12 million to help the industry transition when the Mossman mill became unviable.\n\nHalf of that had already been used to help transport the cane over the last two seasons.\n\nThe Mulgrave mill will continue to process sugar from local growers.\n\n$6m left for solution\n\nQueensland Primary Industries Minister Tony Perrett said the government's commitment to support Mossman canegrowers had not changed.\n\nHe said the unspent $6 million in government funding would be available for a longer-term solution that would be worked out with growers, councils and the Mossman community.\n\nCook MP David Kempton is the chair of the Mossman Advisory Council, which must decide how to spend the money.\n\nHe said that might include planning for a future beyond cane harvesting.\n\nThe Mossman mill operated as a cooperative enterprise for 127 years. (Supplied: Far Northern Milling)\n\nMr Kempton said one million tonnes of cane a year needed to be harvested to sustain the industry, but Douglas growers only produced about half that.\n\n\"It's just not viable without a lot of government input,\" he said.\n\n\" It's just come to its natural conclusion. \"\n\nMr Kempton said it was possible that some of the 40-odd local growers might wish to grow cane next year, but farmers would have to find a way to have it processed.\n\n\"I'm hoping there'll be a strong transition into other crops,\" he said.",

        "text": "Daniel Bruschweiler knows what it is like to come in second place.\n\nThe up-and-coming comedian has taken silver in no fewer than four open mic competitions, including the Melbourne International Comedy Festival's prestigious RAW Comedy competition.\n\nBut for this year's Brisbane Melt Festival, Milton's PIP (Purpose in Performance) Theatre is putting him first for his debut solo show.\n\nBruschweiler and fellow Melt performers have been meeting in preparation for the queer festival. (Supplied)\n\n\"They said, 'We not only want you to do a show, but we want you to be like the headliner. We're putting you in the main theatre.' That was a first,\" Bruschweiler tells ABC Arts.\n\nThe 36-year-old has been a regular on the Brisbane comedy scene for two-and-a-half years, but he says PIP's offer to stage his first solo show, Square Peg, Bonus Hole, has come at the perfect time.\n\nThe multimedia show details his gender transition and how that encouraged him to step into the spotlight.\n\n\"I think I needed to wait until I was this age to be able to do the comedy that I'm going to do. I needed to transition to have the confidence that I have in my sense of comedy,\" he says.\n\nBruschweiler set out to create a show about \"not fitting expectations\", whether it be those from society, parents, peers or someone's high expectations for themselves.\n\n\"It's about how I think I should be as a man, how I think I should be in a relationship, where I should be at this point in my life,\" Bruschweiler says.\n\n\"The central thought is that we need to stop putting such pressure on ourselves, and maybe [with] all these hardships and expectations [we] have, [they] just make you, you.\n\nBruschweiler has been a regular on the Brisbane stand-up circuit for more than two years. (Supplied)\n\n\"I think we have to embrace our bonus holes, basically.\"\n\nWhile Bruschweiler says the Brisbane scene has been overwhelmingly supportive, there is a comfort in performing in an explicitly queer festival.\n\n\"I never want to talk down about non-queer audiences because I have a great time with them, but there's certain jokes that are very queer coded, that just kind of goes over their heads,\" he says.\n\nKeeping in the spirit of community support, Bruschweiler is also turning his solo show into a fundraiser, selling shirts to raise money for top surgery for two close friends.\n\n\"[The shirts] say, 'laugh my tits off' and they have little surgery scars under the words,\" he laughs.\n\nMaking Space\n\nStarting as a singular venue event in 2015, Melt Festival has expanded to more than a dozen venues around Brisbane. PIP associate producer Jules Berry, a performer themselves, participated in multiple PIP performances before taking on their current role.\n\nThis will be PIP's second year partnering with Melt, with Berry counting 2024's offerings as the work they are most proud of to date.\n\n\"I loved [PIP's] ethos, the vision and the role it plays in supporting independent professional artists,\" Berry says. (Supplied: Naz Mulla)\n\n\"What started as just two productions as part of Melt quickly grew into a full festival in its own right, with 29 shows over 13 days and more than 1,000 people in attendance,\" they say.\n\nWhile PIP's 2025 line-up still contains unique theatre and art performances, Berry wanted to up the comedy content this year.\n\n\"PIP's mission is to inspire social change, foster creativity, broaden horizons and enrich the performing arts scene through the power of performance and purpose-driven theatre,\" Berry says.\n\n\"I wanted to create a safe and supportive space for Meanjin's LGBTQIA+SB stand-up comedians, where they could perform knowing the audience was truly with them.\"\n\nPIP's performance spaces are regularly transformed to house their eclectic productions. (Supplied: Kris Anderson)\n\nBerry says it's the diversity of PIP's 2025 line-up that excites them most.\n\n\"At the heart of each event are creatives bringing their craft to life, sharing their wildly entertaining, clever and raw stories,\" they say.\n\nThe unique duel-level layout at PIP gives emerging comedians a rare opportunity: to perform in a 130-seat professional theatre with nary a milk crate in sight.\n\n\"PIP offers such versatility and, importantly, it's an accessible venue, which means more people can experience the work,\" they say.\n\nOpen to all\n\nAccessibility was front-of-mind for Zoe Oh Gee and Lily Mitchell when the rising comedians were concocting their split-bill show for Melt.\n\nMitchell is legally blind, which makes traversing brightly lit, makeshift stages a daunting task.\n\n\"[Zoe and I] have kind of similar experiences of how we've gone about our queer journey,\" says Mitchell (right). (Supplied)\n\n\"I often feel like I get frozen in place because I can't see the edges properly or the lights, so to have the room at PIP to gallivant around, it's much more accessible to me,\" Mitchell tells ABC Arts.\n\nBeyond making the venue as accessible for themselves as performers, Mitchell, Oh Gee and PIP set out to make their show, Oh, Am I?, as welcoming as possible by including Auslan interpreters.\n\n\"My roommate is deaf and they don't get a chance to come to my shows. It's really hard in the open-mic scene and you're not really sure if the space is safe to advocate for accessibility,\" Mitchell says.\n\n\"To have Auslan interpretation at PIP makes me feel good that they can actually access the show.\"\n\n\"Whenever I do neurodiverse content, I have a few audience members come up and thank me, which reminds me why I do this crazy thing,\" Mitchell says. (Supplied)\n\nWhile Bruschweiler's show concentrates on accepting your limitations, Oh, Am I? is about pushing past them and \"the quiet triumph of claiming spaces you weren't invited to\". The show sees the pair utilise all the features PIP has to offer, from lively visual projections to physical props.\n\n\"I think, just because we're queer, or in Lily's case has a disability, or, like, I'm an engineer so it's a very male-dominated space, and that we can't do certain things,\" Oh Gee says.\n\n\"From a comedy standpoint it's important to have that diversity on the stage.\n\n\" It's not just background and queerness and things like that \u2014 those are all part of it \u2014 but also having different stories to share. \"\n\nWhile Oh Gee and Mitchell say PIP's accessibility was a major part of why they pursued the venue for their show, knowing the theatre \u2014 and Melt as a festival \u2014 is a welcome reprieve from the general open-mic scene.\n\n\"You don't always want to have conversations about how funny racist jokes are,\" Oh Gee says.\n\n\"There's not enough queer spaces in Brisbane where audience members and performers can feel completely safe or that they're not a novelty,\" Oh Gee says. (Supplied)\n\n\"Sometimes you can accidentally land in those spaces \u2014 surrounded by people who think that that is a funny conversation \u2014 and you kind of then have to extract yourself, even though you're there to do the gig.\"\n\nMitchell agrees, asserting that her condition makes her a target for other comics to try out their disability material.\n\nOh Gee says Melt at PIP allows performers who aren't your usual open-mic comics to completely relax into their performance.\n\n\"All the performers at PIP were talking and one of the things that kept coming up was that we don't have to get across the fact that we're queer,\" she says.\n\n\" This is just a space where I'm talking about me being a human being. \"\n\nMelt Festival at PIP runs from October 23 to November 9.",

(ABC News: Cameron Best, file photo)\n\nPeter Brick is a regional manager for Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMVic) in Gippsland.\n\nHe said autumn and winter presented opportunities to undertake extra fuel reduction in the state.\n\n\"We were able to treat nearly 40,000 hectares of public lands across 81 different planned burns,\" he said.\n\n\"They'll provide immediate benefit this summer to reduce the risk of bushfire to the community.\"\n\nOther fuel reduction works conducted throughout winter include fuel break maintenance, roadside slashing, and track maintenance.\n\nMr Brick said planned burns had a role to play in reducing fire risk, particularly around houses and communities.\n\n\"But we also burn further out across the landscape, and those larger landscapes really give firefighters a chance to get there, and keep fires small,\" he said.\n\n'It isn't the simple fix'\n\nPlanned burns have been used in Victoria since the late 1930s to manage bushfire risk.\n\nBut it is a mode of fire fuel load management that some have been pushing back on.\n\nAustralian National University professor David Lindenmayer has published more than 1,442 scientific works, and is an expert in forest ecology and resource management.\n\nHe has questioned the practicality of using burns as a fuel reduction technique, and said there was evidence showing planned burning could increase fire risk instead of reducing it.\n\n\"The evidence to support prescribed burning is actually remarkably thin,\" Professor Lindenmayer said.\n\nHe said the vigorous nature of regrowth after a fire created flammable material, whereas older forest material was less flammable, known as disturbance-stimulated flammability.\n\nDavid Lindenmayer says embracing technology is the way forward. (ABC News: Alan Weedon)\n\nHe said while burns did work for a short window of time \u2014 about five years \u2014 the system could become more flammable for 40 to 50 years after.\n\n\"It generally has limited effect under extreme fire weather conditions,\" he said.\n\n\"It costs a lot of money and has limited effectiveness when we are most likely to lose houses under extreme fire weather.\n\n\" The aim of the game is to reduce fire risk, but in some cases ... prescribed burning could be making it worse in the medium to long-term. \"\n\nProfessor Lindenmayer said turning to new technologies, such as firefighting drones which can quickly reach remote fires while they are small, could be a better way to mitigate fire risk.\n\n\"You can do it within 5 to 10 minutes if you've got the right density of drones.\"\n\nWith more than 20 years' experience monitoring forest ecosystems, ecologist Karl Just has conducted more than 1,000 fuel hazard assessments using Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action (DEECA) and FFMVic methods.\n\n\"Planned burning isn't the simple fix it's often made out to be,\" Mr Just said.\n\n\"In most forests, it only lowers fuels for two or three years before regrowth makes things worse.\n\n\"Fire actually triggers dense shrub growth that can last decades, meaning long-unburnt forests often end up with less fuel than those burned more frequently.\"\n\nMr Just said planned burning should remain part of future fuel reduction strategies, but studies showed most risk reduction happened within 50 metres around homes and not by burning in remote bushland.\n\nA sign alerts visitors to a planned burn at Wilsons Promontory. (ABC News: Madeleine Stuchbery)\n\n'We use science'\n\nBut authorities say Gippsland's fuel-driven bushfire risk is well within the target range, off the back of opportunities to carry out risk reduction works through 2023-24.\n\nFFMVic chief fire officer Chris Hardman said its bushfire risk management program was underpinned by a significant body of evidence and the department continued to invest in research and the best science.\n\n\"We use science and modelling tools to choose the right time and approach to deliver our bushfire risk management program, including planned burns, mowing, slashing and spraying,\" he said.\n\n\"We know from both research and practical experience that fuel management slows the spread of fire, and helps firefighters reduce threats to communities, critical infrastructure and the environment.\"",

        "text": "Things were looking pretty sombre on the win-loss ledger for Richmond's AFLW side three weeks ago when they recorded their seventh straight defeat to start the season.\n\nWhether they would end the year without a win was a storyline then quickly put to bed when they upset Adelaide in round eight, had a valiant loss to ladder-leaders North Melbourne the following week, then took down Collingwood on Sunday afternoon.\n\nWith just two rounds left in the home-and-away season, and starting to play some good footy, Tigers defender Libby Graham says it is hard knowing they had no time left to build on that momentum.\n\nThat is in light of the AFLW's short 12-round season.\n\n\"I think it [more rounds] would benefit everyone across the comp, for all of us, to get better,\" Graham told ABC Sport.\n\n\"The more games we get to play, the better we all become. I don't think there's a huge discrepancy between this team's developing, this team's not, but it would advantage us. It would provide all of us with an advantage if we played more.\"\n\nLibby Grahram says she'd like a longer season for fans to be able to jump on board as momentum for teams build. (Getty: Daniel Pockett)\n\nGraham added that while the Tiger Army had shown support throughout the nine weeks of their season, most without much success, she felt fans deserved to see more games too.\n\n\"If we had a longer time to build momentum \u2026 we would have more chance for people to jump on board,\" she said.\n\nThe AFLW has grown from seven rounds to 12 over its 10 seasons, which has created more opportunities for sides to dip and come back.\n\nSt Kilda had a period of three consecutive losses earlier this season, but now sit firmly in finals contention at 5th on the ladder after six previous wins.\n\nKangaroos move closer to remarkable winning record North Melbourne moves closer to equalling the all-time VFL/AFL winning record with a 40-point drubbing of Adelaide.\n\nHowever, in 2022, when the season was 10 rounds, coaches and players said the competition felt like a \"pressure cooker to get things right straight away\".\n\nWestern Bulldogs assistant coach and former Geelong captain Melissa Hickey said the short season allowed no time for teething periods.\n\n\"There isn't that ability and that time to get your forwards gelling or get your structure down pat,\" Hickey said.\n\n\"I think that's deeply felt from both players and the coaches\".\n\nEchoing this, when asked what changed for Richmond to see them now notch wins on the board, Graham said \u2014 while it was hard to pinpoint the exact reason \u2014 it was the side starting to really click into formation.\n\nAfter four rounds without a win, AFLW analyst and commentator Gemma Bastiani told ABC Sport the Tigers were getting the ball inside 50 more than previous seasons but were just unable to convert due to a lack of connection.\n\nLibby Graham says it's hard to build momentum with just 12 rounds in the AFLW. (Getty: Michael Willson/AFL Photos)\n\nAgainst Collingwood, captain Katie Brennan finished with three goals and spearhead Caitlin Greiser two.\n\nGraham said the focus for Richmond now was to finish the season as strongly as possible to try and keep the momentum up for next year.\n\n\"If we want to be aiming for finals, [as] every team does, then we need to treat these next two games as if \u2026 you're going into finals. Because we want that to be our goal,\" she said.\n\n\"We don't want to start dropping off now. If we can start getting trust right now, that's really important.\n\n\"It does kind of suck that [the season's] coming to an end a little bit, but so grateful that \u2026 we're playing some good footy now.\"",

Employees are able to salary package up to $9,010 per year for general living expenses and $2,650 for meals and entertainment under a fringe benefits tax (FBT) exemption available to not-for-profit hospitals.\n\nWhat for-profit company Healthscope wants is for its employees to access the benefit and then keep only 10 per cent of it, giving the broke company the bulk of the cash.\n\nIf only seven in 10 staff take up the proposal, 90 per cent of the benefit will continue to be returned to Healthscope.\n\nIf more staff take it up \u2013 nine in 10 \u2013 then Healthscope\u2019s take will progressively reduce to 60 per cent.\n\nIf the proposal goes ahead, it could cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in foregone tax revenue, with only a fraction of the benefit going to the workers.\n\nCollapse leads to radical changes\n\nHealthscope's lenders appointed receivers to run the private health network, Australia's second largest, in May.\n\nIts 37 hospitals continue to operate while the administrators try to find a buyer for part or all of the network, which is under a crushing amount of debt, reportedly $1.6 billion.\n\nA plan to restructure the company as a charity is underway.\n\nChief executive Tino La Spina emailed staff a recent update about what he called \"exciting developments\".\n\n\"You may have seen that the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission has approved Healthscope's application to register as a charity,\" he wrote.\n\n\"This is a very important step and gives us huge confidence to move ahead as a For Purpose organisation.\"\n\nBecoming a not-for-profit entity will allow Healthscope to pay less tax, offer salary packaging and potentially keep the fledgling private hospital network alive.\n\nIn emails with staff, it has discussed a new not-for-profit entity called PurposeCo. The salary-packaging idea is just one way it is trying to negotiate the administration process and find a new buyer.\n\nThe national regulator of charities, the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission (ACNC), declined to answer questions about the listing. The ACNC is subject to strict confidentiality provisions that prevent it from discussing applications.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson said: \"By law the ACNC cannot speak publicly about the circumstances of any charity.\"\n\nThe Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission says the charity's effective date of registration was August 12, 2025.\n\nHS PURPOSE TOPCO LTD was registered in August. In a governing document authored by law firm Arnold Bloch Leibler, the principal \"object\" of the company was described as:\n\n\" \u2026 provide relief from sickness, helplessness, suffering, misfortune, disability, distress and need by providing, and facilitating the provision of, medical and health care services to people in Australia. \"\n\nPartners at administrator McGrathNicol Jason Ireland, Katherine Sozou, Keith Crawford and Matthew Caddy are listed as directors and \"responsible people\" of the new entity. All were contacted for comment.\n\nIf a buyer is found, the administrators will transfer the directorships to the new owners.\n\nAssistant Minister for Productivity, Competition, Charities and Treasury, Andrew Leigh says becoming a charity is not easy.\n\n\"The Australian Government expects charities to uphold the highest standards of integrity. Charitable status comes with responsibilities to act in the public interest,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"The Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission operates independently of government, but the rules are clear: charities must remain charitable, operate lawfully, and be run in an accountable and responsible way. Any organisation that breaches those obligations risks losing its charitable status and the trust of the public.\"\n\nTax expert issues warning\n\nJason Ward, the principal analyst at the Centre for International Corporate Tax Accountability & Research (CICTAR), was blunt about Healthscope's move to become a charity.\n\nJason Ward has rubbished Healthscope's plan to take 90 per cent of a tax benefit accrued by individual workers. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine)\n\n\"This is a phoney use of a non-profit status in order to create private wealth,\" he said.\n\n\"It absolutely makes no sense.\n\n\"This is a company that has over a trillion US dollars in assets and has mastered the art of profit-shifting and not paying its fair share on hugely lucrative investments in Australia.\"\n\nIn late 2019, just months before the COVID-19 pandemic swept the globe, Canadian-based asset manager Brookfield snapped up the healthcare group for $4.4 billion. Brookfield then lumbered the hospitals with $1.6 billion in debt as it repatriated cash back to its head office.\n\n\"Brookfield has a history of essentially shifting profits on huge amounts of investments in Australia offshore, usually through Bermuda, sometimes the Cayman Islands,\" Mr Ward said.\n\n\"This is a typical private equity playbook model, where they have sold out the real estate underneath it in order to finance the deal and loaded the company with tonnes of debt. So they made money during the process but left a shell of a company \u2026 littered in bankruptcy.\"\n\nBrookfield declined to comment.\n\nHealthscope says changes necessary\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Healthscope said the administration and receivership process curtailed its ability to comment.\n\n\"While a sale process is currently underway, an alternative not for profit model for Healthscope is being developed,\" they said.\n\n\"As part of this, we are putting forward a salary packaging option that provides for both significant financial benefits to staff, while helping to support the viability of a not for profit Healthscope.\"\n\nThe statement said the option being put to employees could give up to 40 per cent of the benefit to employees \u2014 if more than 90 per cent of staff took up the offer \u2014 \"with a view that this would increase over time\".\n\n'Why should they be the ones to bail out Healthscope?'\n\nRebecca Sprekos, assistant secretary of the Health and Community Services Union (HACSU), said the salary-packaging proposal was worrying staff.\n\n\"They're really distressed. They're confused,\" she said.\n\nRebecca Sprekos says health workers are reporting \"fairly confronting and pushy\" attempts by management to get them to agree to the proposal. (ABC News: Darryl Torpy)\n\n\"Members just think that it's completely unfair. Why should they be the ones to bail out Healthscope and what's happened to them financially?\"\n\nMs Sprekos says staff were being told that if they did not sign up to the proposal they would lose their jobs and hospitals would close.\n\nFigures provided by the Health Services Union provide examples of the scheme would work for a person earning $80,000 a year.\n\nThey would pay approximately $17,947 a year in income tax.\n\nWithout packaging, their take-home pay would be $62,053\n\nWith packaging, under the \"90 per cent to Healthscope\" plan, they would get a $590 benefit, with take-home pay of $62,643\n\nIf they got the full (100 per cent) benefit, they would get a $5,900 benefit with take-home pay of $67,953\n\nSome institutions, like NSW Health, began packaging programs that returned a fraction to the institution to cover administration costs. That proportion has been wound back to zero, meaning employees get the full benefit.\n\nIn a recent email to staff, Healthscope's chief executive back-tracked, suggesting a \"three month 'bonus' period\" of the arrangement would see the full benefit of salary packaging go to staff for a short time.\n\nTino La Spina has told staff the company wants \"to give our people as much of the benefit as we possibly can, while also ensuring that our... plan is commercially viable\". (ABC News: Andrew Altree-Williams)\n\n\"It represents an exciting opportunity for us to give you a greater benefit in the short term,\" Mr La Spina wrote in an email.\n\n\"And of course, we remain committed to progressively increasing the benefit share even further over the longer term, with the aim of returning 100% of the benefit to our people.\"\n\nA Victorian Healthscope worker, speaking anonymously due to restrictions on their ability to comment publicly, said the concept was \"a shock\" to colleagues.\n\n\"We knew Healthscope's financial situation wasn't great, but asking us to donate the majority of an entitlement intended for workers in an underpaid sector to pay off the company's debts wasn't something we expected,\" they said.\n\n\" When I realised that Healthscope would take most of the benefit, I was appalled. \"\n\n\"I'm outraged that Healthscope wants to use our benefits to bail themselves out of their own financial mismanagement. I think it sets a really dangerous precedent.\n\n\"Healthscope's messaging is that this is our chance to be part of the 'destiny' and the 'future' of Healthscope, but this feels dishonest.\"\n\nSalary packaging has implications for things like HECS and Centrelink entitlements, so the potential $600 benefit could be outweighed by losses in individual circumstances.\n\nTax lecturer warns against spending $1 to save 30 cents\n\nTaxation law expert Lisa Greig called it \"a very unusual 'scheme' to say the least\".\n\n\"If it sounds too good to be true, then it is,\" she added.\n\nMs Greig, who lectures for the Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne's business school, said schemes where employees put aside some of their salary to reduce tax were common.\n\nBut this was different, she said.\n\n\"The policy intent of having this exemption is for such entities to be able to attract and retain skilled staff compared to the private sector due to underfunding or workforce shortages,\" she said.\n\n\" The mischief of this scheme is that I have never seen a 90 per cent administration fee in any salary sacrificing arrangement. That is a very significant clipping of a ticket. \"\n\nMs Greig said workers should always get advice and warned against doing something just to get a tax benefit because there were costs to that.\n\nWhere to now?\n\nHealthscope is still seeking buyers for the group.\n\nUnions are urging staff to vote against a proposal that would allow the 90 per cent salary packaging deal. One of their key concerns is the potential spread of similar schemes.\n\n\"There's a danger here of setting a very bad precedent,\" Ms Marshall said.\n\n\"We know that the NDIS, for example, there's a lot of money concerns there. What would happen if a disability provider went under and then decided, 'Hey, we've got this model of what Healthscope's doing. Let's offer salary packaging and let's take the majority of the benefit to get us out of debt.'\"\n\n\"For us it's a very dangerous precedent to be setting.\"\n\nEditor's note 20/10/2025: An earlier version of this story said Healthscope's proposal could cost taxpayers up to $200 million in foregone revenue. This was incorrect. The actual potential revenue foregone is uncertain and the copy has been updated.",

        "text": "It was at the end of a peak egg production period when Victorian poultry farmer Brad McAuliffe first discovered the virus that shut down his business in May 2024.\n\n\"We lost between 500,000 to 600,000 of our birds due to the virus \u2026 I think in revenue we went from $70-80 million down to $0 overnight,\" Mr McAuliffe said.\n\nHis farm in Meredith was one of seven in eastern Australia forced to lock down in the country's worst outbreak of avian influenza, the H7N3 strain.\n\nThere have been no notifications of the disease since March this year, and the federal government declared the H7 strain officially eradicated in June.\n\nIt took Mr McAuliffe more than 12 months to resume full production, but he is not convinced the virus has gone for good.\n\n\"The challenge that we are having with bird flu is a real thing and it's not a thing we are treating as a one-off; it's not if but when we get it next time,\" he said.\n\nAustralian farmers put in biosecurity measures\n\nBrad McAuliffe says it is a question of when, not if, bird flu returns. (ABC Landline: Kathleen O'Connor)\n\nMr McAuliffe has spent millions of dollars to implement a range of biosecurity measures to protect his hens.\n\nThe farm gates are locked and he has installed anti-bacterial sprays for every vehicle that comes and goes.\n\nVisitors sign in using a QR code and must answer a series of questions, including details on where they have travelled in previous days.\n\nIf they have been to another poultry farm in the previous 24 hours, there are more questions.\n\nOnce on-farm, visitors must shower and are provided with clothes and boots to wear in the sheds to prevent introducing or spreading disease.\n\nPoultry workers have a strict uniform, including hair nets when sorting and packing eggs ready to be graded and cleaned.\n\nBrad McAuliffe's gates are locked and visitors must sign in using a QR code. (ABC Landline: Kathleen O'Connor)\n\nThe trays they pack them into for transport from farm to farm are also sanitised.\n\n\"The idea is that they can go through an intensive wash, hot-washed and sanitised, same with the pallets and then we can utilise them through the other farms, and if there is another disease outbreak here, we are not transferring it farm to farm,\" he said.\n\nMr McAuliffe installed new technology to monitor chicken health by controlling temperatures and monitoring how much food and water they consume.\n\nAny change in numbers from the previous day triggers a phone notification.\n\nVisitors are provided with clothes and boots to wear in the sheds. (ABC Landline: Kathleen O'Connor)\n\n\"We check this four times a day. The key thing about this if we see any slight drop in feed consumption, water consumption, egg production, we look at mortality and we investigate,\" Mr McAuliffe said.\n\nThe measures have kept the virus away from his property for now; however, a new threat looms.\n\nThe H5 strain\n\nH5N1 bird flu was discovered in China in 1996 and like H7, it spreads from migrating wild birds to poultry.\n\nIt also infects humans. Four hundred people have died from the virus and almost 1,000 cases have been reported in the past two decades.\n\nIn 2022, H5N1 mutated and spread quickly across the globe, infecting not just tens of thousands of seals and hundreds of thousands of wild birds, but also dairy herds in the United States, and was reported in sheep in the United Kingdom.\n\nAustralia reported its first human case of H5N1 in a returned overseas traveller in 2024.\n\nThis bird died of avian influenza on the Antarctic peninsula. (Supplied: Meagan Dewar)\n\nThe risk of H5N1 infecting Australian birds and mammals is elevated with the arrival of millions of birds in their spring migration.\n\nAustralia is the only continent not to have reported the virus, which has been detected as far away as Antarctica.\n\nMichelle Wille from the World Health Organization, which tracks migratory birds, warned that the virus is only one mutation away from pandemic potential.\n\n\"This H5 virus has proven difficult to control. H7 tends to stick to chickens like glue and we can cull all the chickens and stop the outbreak in its tracks,\" Dr Wille said.\n\n\"But this H5 virus is circulating in everything, not just chickens, but also wild birds, and also dairy cattle, and also marine mammals.\n\n\"So our traditional approaches of control are failing quite miserably.\n\n\"This H5N1 arriving to Australia is going to happen. I can't tell you when, and I can't tell you by which route, but I think it's almost certainly going to happen.\"\n\nAustralia is the only continent not to have reported the virus, which has been detected as far away as Antarctica. (Supplied: Matt Curnock, CSIRO)\n\nCharlotte Wundersitz from the National Farmers' Federation said if it reached Australia, the virus would have a significant impact on agricultural industries, wildlife and the national economy.\n\n\"We had understood this virus to impact poultry farms and poultry farmers are acutely aware of the risk,\" she said.\n\n\"But now we know that livestock producers and farmers as landholders are going to have a far greater level of responsibility if this virus arrives on Australian shores and also the impact possibly will be far greater than we ever realised.\"\n\nCall for rethink of caged egg change\n\nVictorian Farmers' Federation egg group president Brian Ahmed has urged a rethink on government plans to phase out caged egg farming by 2036.\n\nHe said free-range hens were more susceptible to bird flu because they were exposed to diseased wild birds when they roamed in paddocks.\n\nBrian Ahmed says the price of eggs is affected by the cost of dealing with disease outbreaks. (Landline: Tim Lee)\n\n\"Every time there's a disease outbreak it costs millions of dollars to eradicate, clean up and everything and even though government foots the bill initially and cleans it all up, farmers are expected to pay that back through what we call levies,\" he said.\n\n\"We're now impacted with an increase in levies for these disease outbreaks. So eventually that \u2026 comes out in the price of eggs. We have to get that money back.\"\n\nMr McAuliffe agreed and said the last bird flu outbreak caused mass egg shortages and a spike in prices across the country.\n\n\"If you're going to have the birds let outside and mingle with wildlife, that's what the consumer's demanding, there's going to be no way to mitigate it; there's only so much we can do,\" he says.\n\n\"All these biosecurity measures have a cost and a burden on the industry. If you do see the egg prices go up a little bit in the retail market, it's not going into our pockets, it's going into protecting the birds.\"\n\nGovernment ramps up protection\n\nIt took Brad McAuliffe just over 12 months to get back to full production. (ABC Landline: Kathleen O'Connor)\n\nTo protect Australia's $70 billion agricultural industry from avian influenza, the federal Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is investing more than $100 million to increase preparedness and response capability.\n\nA sum of $22.1 million is allocated to manufacturing and storing pandemic vaccines for both humans and native animal species.\n\nCarol Booth from the Invasive Species Council said the virus could have a catastrophic impact on native species.\n\n\"We only need to look to South America to see what we could face in Australia.\n\n\"It arrived in South America in late 2022, and within a few months, it wiped out at least 650,000 wild birds, tens of thousands of mammals.\n\n\"They lost something like 40 per cent of Peru's pelicans, 95 per cent of the elephant seal pups in Argentina. So, the potential for large-scale deaths is high,\" she said.",

Collaborating with performer and dramaturge Victoria Spence, the work Breathing Space plumbs thousands of analog photos to create a no-holds-barred visual retrospective. \u201cIt\u2019s a hybrid performance piece of the photographic pulse of my 20s in approximately 700 images,\u201d James says. \u201cIt all started when I was 21, and I started consciously making images in the queer, kink and fetish scenes in Sydney. \u201cThat led me to social documentation more and more, of queer performance, underground culture and extreme body embodiment, and of a time around HIV and AIDS, around my own youth and around my passion for photography.\u201d Bringing together elements of film, narration, collaborative storytelling and audio clips of people and artists sharing stories of the time, Breathing Space is a journey into personal and shared history. \u201cThere are other amazing queer photographers that have documented events and people,\u201d James say. \u201cWilliam Yang and C. Moore Hardy and Mazz Image, but mainstream gay or Mardi Gras gay or drag, that was a bit more their area.\n\n\u201cMine was much more underground fetish, early Hellfire Club days. There was a blend in performance around how you used your body and what we could get away with. \u201cNothing seems really very extreme to me now, although I\u2019m highly aware that most of what you\u2019ll see in Breathing Space wouldn\u2019t really be allowed. Risk assessments wouldn\u2019t pass it. Body fluids, blood, hanging from ceilings, machinery, all that kind of stuff. \u201cI think it\u2019s time now to honour that period in my own life and also to honour a lot of people who were there and part of it and many people who aren\u2019t here now.\u201d Tommy Misa will be performing his show Working Class Clown at Liverworks. Credit: Jessica Hromas Samoan/Australian writer, performer and artist Tommy Misa is also looking to the past with their work, Working Class Clown. Taking inspiration from Samoan clowning, weaving and architecture, the one-man show explores grief, the Samoan political satire tradition of Fale Aitu and the humour and wisdom of Tommy\u2019s late father, Mefiposeta Misa.\n\n\u201cThe show itself features a fictional clown called Pepe Toa, which means baby warrior, who is navigating a crumbling city, Sydney or any sort of global post-industrial city, whilst also navigating personal grief,\u201d Misa says. \u201cThroughout the show, he\u2019s observing and being present amongst these moments of downfall of empire. \u201cI lost my father a few years ago, and I was very angry and upset, and I was trying to place this anger somewhere. Blame, essentially. I was trying to figure out who to blame. With this show, I didn\u2019t want to look at specific people, I wanted to look at power structures and, in a physical sense, how space can create these rules about how we grieve. Misa\u2019s show celebrates the Samoan political satire tradition of Fale Aitu and his father\u2019s humour. Credit: Jessica Hromas \u201cMy father was a clown, a real clown, as in he was a clown in the everyday sense. So, amongst it all, this show is a story of joy and grief and how they hold each other at simultaneous times. How you need one to have the other.\u201d\n\nNext year, Liveworks moves from annual to biennial, with the next live festival staged in 2027. Artistic director Kate Britton says funding plays a role in this decision, along with a drive to support artists in developing work and connecting them with opportunities at Australian and international venues and festivals. Loading \u201cIt seems like a great blindness in our sector at the moment, and quite often in policy as well, that people want the incredible, internationally touring-ready work for the main stages and the festivals, but they seem to forget where they actually come from in reality,\u201d she says. \u201cEven for artists that do end up working in a more, shall we say, commercial space, or discipline-oriented space, the playgrounds of experimental spaces are still a really big part of their formative years. \u201cThey are often how they develop the skills to finally become the artists they are when the public gets to know them better. \u201cAs an organisation, we are really trying to lean into this idea of what does happen to these works after Liveworks.\u201d",

        "text": "Zip Co rose 2.8 per cent after the buy now, pay later (BNPL) business beat market expectations with its latest numbers, which showed its first-quarter earnings soared 98 per cent to $62.8 million thanks to much higher revenue in the critical US market, where transactions grew by more than half from the same quarter last year. Property stocks were boosted by gains in warehouse and data centre owner Goodman Group (up 1.1 per cent) and shopping centre owner Stockland (up 0.8 per cent), Scentre (up 0.9 per cent) and Vicinity (up 1 per cent). Tech stocks were also higher, helped by a 1.6 per cent gain for NextDC and a 1.4 per cent rise in Life 360 shares. Counter-drone company DroneShield rose 2.4 per cent after reporting its third-quarter sales had increased by more than 1000 per cent to $92.9 million. The war in Ukraine \u201chas irreversibly brought drones and counterdrone solutions into [the] mainstream of conflicts\u201d, it told investors. Car parts retailer Bapcor, which owns the Autobarn chain, plunged 15 per cent after it issued a profit warning, citing \u201cunsatisfactory operational practices requiring immediate attention\u201d. On Wall Street on Friday, a jittery week for US stocks ended on a positive note as the White House soothed anxiety around trade tensions while regional banks rebounded. The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent, as did the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite. Bonds, gold and silver fell.\n\nIndexes had careened through several jarring swings over the week as worries built about the financial health of America\u2019s small and midsized banks, as well as the souring trade relationship between the US and China. However, Friday\u2019s bounce sent the S&P 500 to its best week since August, with Trump expressing optimism that talks with Chinese officials could yield an agreement to defuse the tariff spat between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. A batch of solid results from various regional lenders lifted the banking industry after a rout triggered by concern over credit quality in the economy. Loading \u201cOctober has brought a spooky uptick in market swings,\u201d said Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services. \u201cAfter an extended rally and elevated investor sentiment, markets were vulnerable to negative surprises. We would view deeper pullbacks as opportunities to lean in.\u201d The White House signalled efforts to calm fears of a full-blown trade war that could have a seismic effect on the global economy. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing very well. I think we\u2019re getting along with China,\u201d Trump said. He also indicated that he believed his planned meeting with President Xi Jinping this month would go ahead.\n\nUS bank stocks, meanwhile, stabilised on Friday after several reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. That helped steady the group, a day after tumbling on worries about potentially bad loans. Scrutiny is rising on the quality of loans that banks and other lenders have broadly made following last month\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing of First Brands Group, a supplier of aftermarket auto parts. One of the financial firms that could feel pain because of First Brands\u2019 bankruptcy, Jefferies Financial Group, rose 5.9 per cent on Friday. It had come into the day with a loss of about 30 per cent since mid-September. The question is whether the lenders\u2019 problems are just a collection of one-offs or a signal of something larger threatening the industry. Uncertainty is high following a long stretch where many borrowers were able to stay in business, even with the weight of higher interest rates. And with prices soaring to records for all kinds of investments, the appetite for risk may have become too high. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon addressed the issue on an earnings conference call with analysts last week, warning that \u201cwhen you see one cockroach, there are probably more [...] Everyone should be forewarned on this one.\u201d But Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, said that \u201cbanks make loan loss provisions and typically have plenty of capital to keep the cockroaches from causing structural damage \u2026 Based on earnings and data so far, it looks like this isn\u2019t an infestation.\u201d\n\nLoading In the bond market, Treasury yields steadied following their sharp slides from Thursday, which came as investors rushed into investments seen as safer. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4 per cent from 3.99 per cent late on Thursday. Gold also pulled back from its latest record as more calm seeped through the market. The price for an ounce fell 2.1 per cent to $US4213.30, but it\u2019s still up about 60 per cent for the year so far. Besides worries about tariffs, gold\u2019s price has also surged on expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and concerns about the massive amounts of debt that the US and other governments worldwide are building. In other international markets, indexes dropped across much of Europe and Asia on Friday. Germany\u2019s DAX lost 1.8 per cent, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng sank 2.5 per cent for two of the world\u2019s bigger moves.",

        "text": "Dimon\u2019s comments, however, resonated because they speak to long-standing concerns about the way the global financial system has developed since the 2008-09 financial crisis. Before that crisis, the financial system was split fairly evenly between banks and non-banks. Since then, while the share of the system held by banks has, according to the Bank for International Settlements, grown from 164 per cent of global GDP to 177 per cent, that of the non-banks has exploded from 167 per cent to 224 per cent. Loading With the banks corralled by increased capital and liquidity requirements, the system is now dominated by asset managers, private equity firms, hedge funds, insurers, private credit providers and other non-bank financiers that are far less regulated and whose activities aren\u2019t anywhere near as transparent. While banks might originate and arrange loans, they now increasingly distribute the debt to non-bank institutions and managed funds rather that hold capital-intensive assets on their own balance sheets.\n\nIn many respects, by distributing risk and diversifying exposures to it, the post-GFC architecture of the system ought to reduce systemic risk. The fear is that the concentrations of risk have just been moved elsewhere and contagion within a particular non-bank sector might still be a threat to overall financial stability. There\u2019s also a concern, evident in the recent corporate failures and the allegations of fraudulent activity, that the responsibility and accountability for assessing credit risks have been diluted by the changes in the way loans are now made. Markets have become concerned about the risks from shadow banking to the financial system. Credit: Bloomberg Banks are less concerned about credit quality when they are passing off the risks to a range of third parties. Non-banks don\u2019t necessarily have the risk-evaluation experience or systems to screen credit risks and, in any case, when holding just a slice of a loan within a diversified portfolio of sliced and diced loans funded by other people\u2019s money, they have less motivation to focus on the risk of the individual tranches of loans someone else has arranged and sold down.\n\nIn a post-GFC, post-pandemic environment of loose monetary policies and easy access to cheap money, credit standards and the pricing of risk have become less top-of-mind. Spreads in the junk bonds market have been compressed to the point where there isn\u2019t that much of a distinction between creditworthy borrowers and the riskiest. Financings have also become more complex. First Brands tapped multiple funding markets, from banks, private credit, the leveraged loan and collateralised debt markets and receivables financing. Loading With too much money from too many sources chasing a finite number of opportunities, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that underwriting standards are being questioned within a system where there\u2019s no compelling incentive to devote the resources to scrutinising credit quality, when portfolio approaches to risk management with non-bank funds make individual credit risks immaterial. Easy money and competition make for an uneasy and potentially combustible mix, particularly if risks are rather than being concentrated in individual banks or non-banks, concentrated within a sector. That\u2019s why there has been increased discussion about the rate of growth in the private credit sector, the $US2 trillion market for collateralised loan obligations and other forms of leveraged lending.\n\nBank \u201cruns\u201d may have been made less likely by the tougher regulatory regime introduced after the financial crisis \u2013 although the Trump administration is trying to roll back some of that regulation in the US \u2013 but it is conceivable that there could be a contagion-driven a run on non-bank funds if enough \u201ccockroaches\u201d emerge from within the shadow banking sector \u2013 contagion that could have spillover effects for the banking system. While the US Federal Reserve Board has started to cut interest rates, it has also been unwinding the splurges of cheap credit it injected into the system in the aftermath of the financial crisis and, again, in response to the pandemic. Instead of quantitative easing, the system is now experiencing quantitative tightening. Loading It is instructive that banks were accessing the Fed\u2019s short-term lending facility last week, an indication of liquidity pressures, given that they can normally borrow more cheaply in the market. The era of excess credit might be finally nearing its end. The recent spate of corporate collapses \u2013 and the absence of lenders\u2019 due diligence that they suggest \u2013 may be a sign that the non-bank debt market has over-heated and that companies were given credit that they should never have received on terms that didn\u2019t reflect the risk.",

public life than I am today in making this pledge to the Australian people,\" she is expected to say.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The many ways Australia will change under Anthony Albanese's second term\n\nWhile passionate about this pledge, the plan lacks detail, by her own admission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whilst early work on our tax cuts plan has already begun, we will determine the scale and scope of our eventual package as the final budget position becomes clearer over the next two and a half years,\" the excerpt reads.\n\n\n\n\n\nLey also has budget repair in her sights and will accuse Labor of being wasteful in its spending.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition leader will propose a smaller government that will be \"focused and targeted\", which will cost the taxpayers less money to fund, and do \"fewer things and do them better\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are no details on how the Coalition would reduce the size and cost of the government.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the lead-up to the last election, then Opposition leader Peter Dutton vowed to cut 41,000 Canberra-based public servants , saying it would save $10 billion over the forward estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's possible a similar plan could be announced by the Coalition during the next campaign.\n\n\n\nIndustrial reforms and EV incentives\n\nLey will also criticise two more Labor policies.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe will firstly attack Labor's electric vehicle tax break, saying it is \"not about fairness\".\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Labor's current policy, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles do not attract fringe benefits tax if they fall under the luxury car tax threshold of $91,387 and are bought through a salary packaging program.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has previously supported this policy, but later backflipped in April with Dutton labelling it \"wasteful spending\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a sentiment Ley is anticipated to maintain.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition leader will also call Labor's industrial relations laws a \"handbrake on productivity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has made it easier to access multi-employer bargaining, which allows workers in a certain sector, such as childcare, to get together and negotiate a deal that would apply across a number of employers.\n\n\n\nLey will say multiple employer bargaining laws are \"threatening small businesses\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Labor\u2019s push to legislate one-size-fits-all approaches across whole sectors ignores the needs of many employers and workers,\" the speech reads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will chart a different course.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLey will instead propose enterprise\u2013level bargaining over industry-wide policies, which would mean employers and employees negotiate to set the terms and conditions of employment.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of this is an enterprise agreement.\n\n\n\nLabor criticises Ley's plan\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers has been asked about Ley's speech, and told reporters on Monday morning that Ley has \"no costings, no details and no idea\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we legislated two more tax cuts for every taxpayer, the Liberals and Nationals voted against them and promised to repeal them,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If they won the election and had their way, income taxes would be going up not down.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO 'We didn\u2019t just lose, we got smashed': Sussan Ley charts a new way forward for Liberals SBS News 04:00 English\n\nLabor has recently announced its own financial policy reform , this time in relation to superannuation changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe changes include the removal of tax on unrealised capital gains, which Chalmers said \"was a genuine sticking point\" for critics, hoping its removal will mean \"no excuses but to support\" the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralians on lower incomes will also see a change to their super tax offset, which will increase from $500 to $810 as the government expands the eligibility criteria from a $37,000 cut-off to $45,000.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "As another year draws closer to its end, you may be feeling like it's been a bit of a slog.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf so, you're not alone. It's estimated that nearly three million Australians are likely to consider leaving their job in the next year, and one of the big drivers is burnout.\n\n\n\n\n\nBurnout is a feeling of emotional, physical and mental exhaustion caused by excessive demands at work or in your personal life, according to mental health support organisation Beyond Blue.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can affect anyone and can lead to more negative outcomes for your health and well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite growing awareness around mental health, recently enshrined right-to-disconnect laws , and many taking up working-from-home arrangements , research is showing that workplace burnout is getting worse.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how can you tell if you're experiencing burnout, and what can workers and employers do to help prevent it?\n\n\n\nHow big of a problem is burnout in Australia?\n\nAssociate Professor Ross Iles is the chief research officer at Superfriend, an Australian not-for-profit that provides organisations with mental health training and support.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says that over the past decade, burnout has remained stubbornly high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we focus in on particular industries like retail, health, and education, that's actually becoming a much more important factor. In fact, it's getting worse,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Is your job burning you out? Experts say better boundaries and workplace connections can help SBS News 05:16 English\n\nWhile awareness of mental health issues has increased in many workplaces, that hasn't translated to a significant decrease in burnout, Iles said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile such developments were positive, things \"aren't quite shifting fast enough to keep up with the levels of burnout\", he said.\n\n\n\nHow can you tell if you're experiencing burnout?\n\nBurnout can present itself in different ways, but there are a few common signs that experts say shouldn't be ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\nMental and emotional signs to watch out for include feelings of isolation and irritation, as well as feeling less satisfied with work or disengaging from work that you once valued.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere can also be physical signs, with burnout sometimes leading to increased headaches and body pain, as well as disrupted sleep patterns.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Feeling depleted by work? This is how Melanie beat burnout without quitting her job\n\nA lack of energy can also be an indicator that you might be feeling burned out.\n\n\n\n\n\nIles said psychological distress is one of the top factors driving burnout in industries like health care, which, alongside education and retail, has some of the highest reported burnout rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Psychological distress is that generalised stress and anxiety that people experience in all aspects of their life,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And so when people are experiencing high levels of psychological distress, particularly for a prolonged period, that's going to increase their burnout or the likelihood they're going to report burnout.\"\n\n\n\nWhat can be done to reduce workplace burnout?\n\nAccording to research conducted by YouGov and commissioned by Allianz Australia, around four in five Australian workers felt their workplace failed to enforce healthy habits and boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\nExcessive workloads, too many meetings and unrealistic deadlines were among the leading contributors to burnout that were cited.\n\n\n\n\n\nMark Pittman, executive general manager of personal injury at Allianz Australia, said the research showed employees were struggling to schedule personal time for themselves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We encourage Australians to take a proper break, set boundaries and prioritise recovery activities such as sleep and exercise, and making these small changes can really make a difference in helping to prevent burnout,\" Pittman said.\n\n\n\nBut employers also have a big role to play in helping employees avoid burnout, Pittman said, with Allianz's research identifying three solutions desired by employees:\n\n\n\nBetter training for managers to support employee wellbeing\n\nFewer unnecessary tasks and meetings that add to employees' workload without adding value\n\nRecurring mental health days off work\n\nIles said leaders in the workplace have a responsibility to create healthy environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While we've been making progress, we still find that less than half of Australian workers feel comfortable talking to their manager about mental health, and we find that figure hasn't shifted too much,\" Iles said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it's really important to break down that stigma, and that will help prevent burnout.\"\n\n\n\nIles said that perhaps the most important thing employers can do, though, is to deliberately think about connectedness and how good relationships and a good working environment can be fostered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Not to just think of it happening by chance, but to actually deliberately foster opportunities for employees to connect with each other.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders seeking crisis support can ring Lifeline on 13 11 14 or text 0477 13 11 14, the Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467 and Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800 (for young people aged up to 25).

        "text": "Sixteen years ago, Snohi Grewal arrived in Melbourne with a suitcase full of her belongings and a heart full of hope.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was a student at the time \u2014 wide-eyed, eager and certain that Australia would become her second home. Now, the 39-year-old mother is raising her two children in Melbourne's Berwick, in a house where the sounds of Bollywood lullabies and backyard kabaddi (a contact team sport) can often be heard.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Grewal, who hails from Amritsar in northern India, Diwali has always been the thread connecting her past and present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've always loved celebrating Diwali here,\" she tells SBS News, as diyas (oil lamps) flicker in her living room, echoing those her mother used to light back home. \"It's how I pass on my culture to my kids.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOften called the festival of lights, Diwali is a major celebration in Hindu, Sikh, Jain and some Buddhist traditions \u2014 symbolising the triumph of light over darkness, good over evil, and hope over despair.\n\n\n\nSnohi Grewal (pictured in a yellow Indian traditional suit) with her family during a Diwali celebration in 2024. She says celebrating Diwali in Australia is her way of passing on her culture to her children. Source: Supplied But as Grewal strings fairy lights across her porch ahead of this year's festivities, the glow of Diwali feels somehow dimmer.\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent wave of anti-immigration protests in Australia \u2014 some of which have singled out the Indian community \u2014 has left her feeling unsettled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For the first time in years, I've felt like a guest again,\" she says, her voice soft but steady. \"Like maybe this isn't really mine to claim.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tension deepened last month when Liberal senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price falsely claimed the government had geared its migration program in favour of Indian Australians because they tend to vote Labor.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer remarks drew swift backlash from across the political spectrum and from members of the Indian Australian community, who called them \"un-Australian and divisive\" . The fallout culminated in Price's removal from Opposition leader Sussan Ley's frontbench, after a week-long standoff within the Coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many in the Indian diaspora, which now numbers more than 900,000, this Diwali feels different. Grewal says it's no longer just a cultural or religious celebration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's about showing that we're part of this country, too,\" she says.\n\n\n\nWe've built our lives here. We contribute. We belong.\n\nDiwali endures, but shifting sentiments give pause\n\nGrewal's unease isn't universal, but it's not isolated either. Across the country, as families prepare for Diwali with joy and anticipation \u2014 spring-cleaning homes, buying new clothes, exchanging gifts and planning feasts \u2014 there's a quiet undercurrent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's present in WhatsApp chats and conversations over chai, where some members of the community are asking: how do you celebrate when your sense of belonging is under threat?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a question that weighs on Arun Sharma, who arrived in Australia in the mid-1970s and has since seen Diwali evolve from small family gatherings into large-scale festivals supported by councils and embraced by multicultural communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nSharma tells SBS News his connection to Diwali goes beyond lights and sweets: \"It's also about community, social cohesion and belonging.\"\n\n\n\nSince arriving in Australia in the mid-1970s, Arun Sharma (second from right) says he has watched the Indian diaspora grow from a quiet minority into a vibrant, visible part of the country's multicultural identity. Source: Supplied Each year, Sharma, who is the chair of the Celebrate India Inc. group, organises one of the country's biggest Diwali celebrations at Melbourne's Federation Square \u2014 an event that draws thousands, complete with music, markets and cultural performances. As part of week-long celebrations, the group also hosts similar events at other venues across Victoria.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this year, Sharma admits, the atmosphere feels a little different.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact is, this sentiment is revisiting us after a couple of years now, when things were not very pleasant,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People are scared, and they are a bit worried about it, [asking] 'What's going to happen, where's the future here?'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid community concern, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese publicly reaffirmed the government's support last month, calling Indian Australians a \"vital part of modern Australia\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking with the ABC's RN Breakfast show, he said: \"I just say to the Indian community: you're valued, you're welcome here, you make our country stronger by being here. And thank you for everything that you do to make Australia a better place.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Liberal MP Julian Leeser apologises for Jacinta Price's comments on Indian migration\n\nThe prime minister's words resonated with Sharma, but he believes they must also guide policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's time for them [the government] to reflect on their policies because overcrowding is one thing which we have to be careful about ... I think they need to control that,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They need to balance it out with the genuine migrants here and those who are on the skills needed list, where they can provide beautiful services.\"\n\n\n\nA newcomer's Diwali \u2014 and first reality check\n\nProportionally, Australia's overseas-born population is one of the largest in the world outside of the Gulf states and Singapore.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as of June 2024, more than 8.6 million people living in Australia were born overseas \u2014 making up 31.5 per cent of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\nJames O'Donnell, a demographer from the Australian National University, tells SBS News that sustained migration has brought cultural richness and economic strength \u2014 but it has also fuelled rapid population growth, putting pressure on housing, infrastructure and public sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"After the COVID-19 pandemic, actual immigration levels did spike sharply. While this looks like it was a temporary spike, it did also produce a spike in the proportion of people who think that immigration is too high,\" he says.\n\n\n\nJames O'Donnell is a demographer focused on understanding and measuring social cohesion within and across neighbourhoods. Credit: Jamie Kidston/ANU Indian-born migrants have driven much of the growth in immigration. The community has expanded from nearly 80,000 people in 1996 to more than 900,000 today, and is now the second-largest overseas-born group in Australia, after those born in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past two years alone, the Indian-born population has grown at nearly twice the rate of those born in all other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nevertheless, immigration to Australia is incredibly diverse, and by no means dominated by arrivals from India or any other country. Indian-born Australians only make up around 11 per cent of Australia's overseas-born population,\" O'Donnell says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the new arrivals is 20-year-old Krishita Sharma, who is pursuing a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity from Melbourne's Swinburne University of Technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe describes Diwali as a time of comfort and familiarity, evoking memories of her youth in India.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as she prepares for her second Australian Diwali, she says it comes with an unexpected dose of reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I came here thinking this was a really multicultural place. And in many ways, it is,\" Sharma tells SBS News.\n\n\n\nBut seeing the recent protests and the way people talk and think about migrants \u2014 it was shocking. I wasn't prepared for that.\n\nSharma says her colleagues and the people she shares accommodation with have helped her find her footing in Australia. This Diwali, she will be busy working but plans to set aside a few hours to share sweets and exchange gifts with her \"borrowed family\".\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a little while at least, it will feel like home, she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not the same, of course. But it still reminds me who I am, and why I came here \u2014 to grow, to learn, to be part of something new.\"\n\n\n\nKrishita Sharma says community leaders and politicians need to do more to help new migrants integrate into Australia's social fabric. Source: Supplied According to O'Donnell, who co-authored the Scanlon Foundation's Mapping Social Cohesion 2024 study, racism, prejudice and discrimination are continuing problems in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"More than one-in-three overseas-born Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds in the Mapping Social Cohesion 2024 survey reported experiencing discrimination in the prior 12 months on the basis of skin colour, ethnic origin or religion,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nSharma says her first experience of racism in Australia came just two months after arriving, while she was at a train station in north Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the incident left her scarred.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was standing at the Donnybrook station and going about my business. It must have been around 9am when a man shouted at me, 'Go back!'\" she recalls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I went home and cried so much; it was so traumatic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Such experiences scar you, and for someone like me who came here with an intention to stay long-term, it makes me rethink my choices. You start questioning, 'If people can't accept me, when I have wholeheartedly accepted them, then what does the future hold for the likes of me?'\"\n\n\n\nO'Donnell says while the Scanlon Foundation's study did not have an indicative sample size for Indian-born respondents, many still reported experiencing discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We consistently see around 40-45 per cent of Indian-born respondents say they experienced discrimination,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says it's hard to predict the long-term impact of recent anti-immigration sentiment, but research shows discrimination leads to lower levels of social cohesion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would strongly suggest that anti-immigration sentiment, especially when it is personally felt in terms of discrimination and mistreatment, is detrimental to an individual's sense of belonging and our overall cohesion,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreeti Nalavadi, an academic and PhD scholar at the University of Adelaide, who is passionate about community advocacy, says the current debate around immigration cannot be limited to intake caps or housing supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Migration defines Australia's character,\" she tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sustainable migration isn't just about getting the numbers right. It's about offering migrants their dignity and valuing their partnership.\"\n\n\n\nDiwali always falls sometime between the months of October and November, but the exact date varies each year as the Hindu calendar is based on the motion of the moon. Credit: MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle via Getty Images Nalavadi points to the contributions of the Indian Australian community across a diverse range of industries, such as business, medicine and academia, as well as civic life and cultural leadership. Yet, she says, many still feel unseen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We work, contribute, belong and yet are treated as outsiders. Australia must do more to protect and respect those who call it home,\" she says.\n\n\n\nAustralia cannot move ahead without Indian migrants.\n\nFor some, Diwali says what words can't\n\nWhile some migrants are feeling the weight of recent events, many still experience Australia as a place of genuine opportunity and feel welcomed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Diwali, for those in the Indian diaspora, remains a joyful and unifying celebration \u2014 a time to reflect on progress, pride and shared identity.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut even among the hopeful, there's a growing awareness that inclusion must be actively nurtured, not passively assumed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Celebrating Diwali is not enough,\" Arun Sharma says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to make a little bit more effort from our side as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'd like to see people inviting their neighbours [from non-Indian backgrounds] and getting them aware of our culture and participating in festivities so they can learn more about us, our backgrounds and contribute towards integration.\"\n\n\n\nSnohi Grewal says this year, Diwali feels a lot more than just a cultural or religious celebration. Source: Supplied Meanwhile, as diyas flicker across Grewal's windowsill, she reflects on what Diwali means this year \u2014 not just for her young family, but for herself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're celebrating,\" she says, as her children laugh and dance to Indian beats.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also her way of saying: \"We're here, we're part of this place, and we matter.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Over the weekend, the federal government released its rapid review into school bullying.\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthored by clinical psychologist Charlotte Keating and suicide prevention expert Jo Robinson, the review received more than 1,700 submissions from parents, students, teachers and school staff. The majority were from parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid ongoing community concerns about the devastating impacts of bullying, what does the review get right? Where are the weak spots?\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd is a call for schools to respond to a complaint of bullying in two days reasonable?\n\n\n\nWhat did the review find?\n\nThe review acknowledges bullying is not a single issue with a single fix.\n\n\n\n\n\nBullying sits on a continuum of harmful behaviours that cuts across wellbeing, behaviour, attendance, engagement and family functioning.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also notes students are not the only ones who bully. Sometimes staff and parents are the perpetrators.\n\n\n\nThe review calls for school cultures that prioritise empathy and kindness \u2014 two of the key priorities in our current national education declaration.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe review recommends clear policies and procedures around bullying, simple reporting pathways, and more training for teachers to help them manage their classrooms and deal with bullying.\n\n\n\nIs it reasonable for schools to act within 2 days?\n\nMany caregivers during the review said they felt nothing happened after reporting concerns to their child's school. The first casualty of many bullying incidents is the relationship and trust between families and the school.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most prominent recommendations is schools should respond within two school days to a complaint or incidence of bullying.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis requires schools to show they have provided immediate safety measures and started an unbiased investigation. It recognises more complex cases may take longer to resolve, but this initial action is essential.\n\n\n\nSetting a predictable two-day clock signals harmful behaviour will be taken seriously and the school will keep people informed as the process unfolds. This is realistic for schools \u2014 noting complex cases will take longer to properly resolve.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the review noted, schools that already do this well have a simple reporting pathway and communication templates.\n\n\n\n\n\nTime is provided for staff to see students outside of class and there are clear escalation routes if concerns are not resolved.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is visible early action so students feel protected and families know what will happen next.\n\n\n\nWhat does the review get right?\n\nThe review is grounded in research evidence. It acknowledges the multifaceted nature of bullying, puts respectful relationships at the centre, and treats bullying as a whole school community issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is what current research suggests is the best way to approach this damaging issue.\n\n\n\nThe federal government announced a $10 million investment into a new national plan to combat school bullying on Saturday. Source: Getty / monkeybusinessimages It also calls for visible leadership and early action from the school, so trust does not erode while families wait for updates.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt backs practical approaches to enable students to support peers and report concerns if they see something wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantly, it allows schools to tailor how they work. This is especially important in rural and remote areas where staffing, services and community relationships differ.\n\n\n\nAre there risks or weak spots?\n\nThere is a risk of a 'policy pile-on'.

I was born on Ngunnawal Country. Growing up, it\u2019s obviously not something that I celebrated, but it\u2019s an honour to be married to a Punjabi man and raising Sikh Punjabi children. So I think it's paying homage to that culture and making sure it continues on through our family.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nInderjit migrated from Punjab, India more than a decade ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo children later, the family is creating a new way to celebrate culture, identity, and love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not just about being guests in each other's culture, but it's participating it, learning in it so that we're demonstrating that strength to our children. Both Punjabi culture and Aboriginal culture are very inclusive and open and I'm a part of his culture and his family and he's a part of mine.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether for 10 years, the couple say they\u2019ve found common ground in both of their cultural backgrounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is Inderjit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The similarity is the earth, water and the sky and obviously nature. Aboriginal culture is depending on what we have and sharing with everyone else, same as our Punjabi culture, that we come from a state of agriculture where we totally depend on nature as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Punjabi culture is beautiful. South Asian culture is beautiful, and Aboriginal culture is deeply rooted in country, in connection and it's the foundation of all Australian culture. So I think coming together to celebrate Diwali together, all of us is really important.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 Census, more than a million Australians identify with South Asian heritage, and about 700,000 people in Australia celebrate Diwali each year \u2014 a number that continues to grow.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Punjabi community is Australia\u2019s fastest-growing language group.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many families, Diwali isn\u2019t just about lights and food; it\u2019s about how love, culture, and celebration can bridge differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Take the moment to spend with the family and make sure we teach the kids why we are celebrating and why it is important.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Lighting the diyas, but also going to Mela eating, sharing food either with our friends or our family. It means going to Gurdwara. It's talking about the history and what that looks like for our children and for us as a family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMelas are public Diwali celebrations which include cultural performances, traditional food and market stalls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The strength of Diwali is about inclusivity. Triumphing good over evil and the more we learn about each other's cultures and the more we come together, we can make a positive change.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Australia\u2019s Diwali, where every light tells a story of cultures coming together.\n\n\n\n",

She hurt her back really badly, and because of her age, she\u2019ll never fully recover.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, the Safe Recovery Program raises awareness about preventing falls in hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s designed for patients and staff to boost knowledge of fall risks, and is delivered in the form of videos and pamphlets.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s written and delivered in English, which presents a challenge for migrant communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why Ms Zhang, Mr Zhou and Dr Loo decided to translate the entire program into Mandarin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Having translations allows the individual patient to actually engage with information directly. There are very much cultural nuances that inform how people are willing to accept and access that information.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFalls are the leading cause of injury hospitalisations nationwide and costing about $5 billion last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost involve people aged 85 and over.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a vibrant morning at Perth\u2019s Chung Wah Community Centre, a group of elderly Chinese residents gather.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome over taichi, some over a few games of mahjong, while others enjoy a good old karaoke.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter lunch they lean in as the two students get up the front - they are delivering the Safe Recovery Program in-language: Mandarin.\n\n\n\n\n\nPictures on-screen show the key to preventing a fall in hospital is simple: ask for help to move, wait for assistance, and never rush or go alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those listening is Liu Xuxiang, an 80-year-old retired worker originally from China\u2019s Jiangsu province.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says these lessons are opening his eyes to risks he never considered and to recognise risks and take action long before a hospital admission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some people think the hospital is a safe place and assume they won\u2019t fall. In reality, falls still happen there quite often. For example, when you go to the bathroom, even a small wet patch on the floor can make you fall. One fall can lead to serious consequences. Since coming to Australia, I\u2019ve seen that people take this issue of older adults falling very seriously and I think that\u2019s great, because awareness is the first step to prevention.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Fang Linkun, who helps run programs at the community centre, the workshops are breaking down more than just barriers - they\u2019re also reshaping attitudes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They give older people a different kind of experience, not really formal teaching, more like sharing their experiences. This helps older people feel, oh, if I do this, I might lower my chances of falling. If I do that, I might avoid a fall, and I might not trouble my children so much. This is because of our Asian cultural background, once people reach a certain age, they try not to bother their children.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Dr Loo says it\u2019s about inclusion, making sure everyone, regardless of background, has the knowledge to stay safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the things they've said to us was that they felt like this information was created for them. And it was that sense of sincerity and appreciation that they were visible. It pays homage to the fact that Australia is a very diverse country. And we've got older people being admitted to hospital that may not necessarily speak English.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of its success, this initiative is now growing.\n\n\n\n\n\nResources have been translated into Vietnamese and Arabic, with Greek and Italian versions next in line.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Elsewhere in the program, which stretches from dance to digital, theatre, talks and photographic works, photographer Jamie James is drawing from their immense personal archive chronicling Sydney\u2019s queer and kink performance culture in the 1990s and 2000s. Collaborating with performer and dramaturge Victoria Spence, the work Breathing Space plumbs thousands of analog photos to create a no-holds-barred visual retrospective. \u201cIt\u2019s a hybrid performance piece of the photographic pulse of my 20s in approximately 700 images,\u201d James says. \u201cIt all started when I was 21, and I started consciously making images in the queer, kink and fetish scenes in Sydney. \u201cThat led me to social documentation more and more, of queer performance, underground culture and extreme body embodiment, and of a time around HIV and AIDS, around my own youth and around my passion for photography.\u201d Bringing together elements of film, narration, collaborative storytelling and audio clips of people and artists sharing stories of the time, Breathing Space is a journey into personal and shared history. \u201cThere are other amazing queer photographers that have documented events and people,\u201d James say. \u201cWilliam Yang and C. Moore Hardy and Mazz Image, but mainstream gay or Mardi Gras gay or drag, that was a bit more their area.\n\n\u201cMine was much more underground fetish, early Hellfire Club days. There was a blend in performance around how you used your body and what we could get away with. \u201cNothing seems really very extreme to me now, although I\u2019m highly aware that most of what you\u2019ll see in Breathing Space wouldn\u2019t really be allowed. Risk assessments wouldn\u2019t pass it. Body fluids, blood, hanging from ceilings, machinery, all that kind of stuff. \u201cI think it\u2019s time now to honour that period in my own life and also to honour a lot of people who were there and part of it and many people who aren\u2019t here now.\u201d Tommy Misa will be performing his show Working Class Clown at Liverworks. Credit: Jessica Hromas Samoan/Australian writer, performer and artist Tommy Misa is also looking to the past with their work, Working Class Clown. Taking inspiration from Samoan clowning, weaving and architecture, the one-man show explores grief, the Samoan political satire tradition of Fale Aitu and the humour and wisdom of Tommy\u2019s late father, Mefiposeta Misa.\n\n\u201cThe show itself features a fictional clown called Pepe Toa, which means baby warrior, who is navigating a crumbling city, Sydney or any sort of global post-industrial city, whilst also navigating personal grief,\u201d Misa says. \u201cThroughout the show, he\u2019s observing and being present amongst these moments of downfall of empire. \u201cI lost my father a few years ago, and I was very angry and upset, and I was trying to place this anger somewhere. Blame, essentially. I was trying to figure out who to blame. With this show, I didn\u2019t want to look at specific people, I wanted to look at power structures and, in a physical sense, how space can create these rules about how we grieve. Misa\u2019s show celebrates the Samoan political satire tradition of Fale Aitu and his father\u2019s humour. Credit: Jessica Hromas \u201cMy father was a clown, a real clown, as in he was a clown in the everyday sense. So, amongst it all, this show is a story of joy and grief and how they hold each other at simultaneous times. How you need one to have the other.\u201d\n\nNext year, Liveworks moves from annual to biennial, with the next live festival staged in 2027. Artistic director Kate Britton says funding plays a role in this decision, along with a drive to support artists in developing work and connecting them with opportunities at Australian and international venues and festivals. Loading \u201cIt seems like a great blindness in our sector at the moment, and quite often in policy as well, that people want the incredible, internationally touring-ready work for the main stages and the festivals, but they seem to forget where they actually come from in reality,\u201d she says. \u201cEven for artists that do end up working in a more, shall we say, commercial space, or discipline-oriented space, the playgrounds of experimental spaces are still a really big part of their formative years. \u201cThey are often how they develop the skills to finally become the artists they are when the public gets to know them better. \u201cAs an organisation, we are really trying to lean into this idea of what does happen to these works after Liveworks.\u201d",

        "text": "Zip Co rose 2.8 per cent after the buy now, pay later (BNPL) business beat market expectations with its latest numbers, which showed its first-quarter earnings soared 98 per cent to $62.8 million thanks to much higher revenue in the critical US market, where transactions grew by more than half from the same quarter last year. Property stocks were boosted by gains in warehouse and data centre owner Goodman Group (up 1.1 per cent) and shopping centre owner Stockland (up 0.8 per cent), Scentre (up 0.9 per cent) and Vicinity (up 1 per cent). Tech stocks were also higher, helped by a 1.6 per cent gain for NextDC and a 1.4 per cent rise in Life 360 shares. Counter-drone company DroneShield rose 2.4 per cent after reporting its third-quarter sales had increased by more than 1000 per cent to $92.9 million. The war in Ukraine \u201chas irreversibly brought drones and counterdrone solutions into [the] mainstream of conflicts\u201d, it told investors. Car parts retailer Bapcor, which owns the Autobarn chain, plunged 15 per cent after it issued a profit warning, citing \u201cunsatisfactory operational practices requiring immediate attention\u201d. On Wall Street on Friday, a jittery week for US stocks ended on a positive note as the White House soothed anxiety around trade tensions while regional banks rebounded. The S&P 500 rose 0.5 per cent, as did the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq composite. Bonds, gold and silver fell.\n\nIndexes had careened through several jarring swings over the week as worries built about the financial health of America\u2019s small and midsized banks, as well as the souring trade relationship between the US and China. However, Friday\u2019s bounce sent the S&P 500 to its best week since August, with Trump expressing optimism that talks with Chinese officials could yield an agreement to defuse the tariff spat between the world\u2019s two biggest economies. A batch of solid results from various regional lenders lifted the banking industry after a rout triggered by concern over credit quality in the economy. Loading \u201cOctober has brought a spooky uptick in market swings,\u201d said Keith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services. \u201cAfter an extended rally and elevated investor sentiment, markets were vulnerable to negative surprises. We would view deeper pullbacks as opportunities to lean in.\u201d The White House signalled efforts to calm fears of a full-blown trade war that could have a seismic effect on the global economy. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing very well. I think we\u2019re getting along with China,\u201d Trump said. He also indicated that he believed his planned meeting with President Xi Jinping this month would go ahead.\n\nUS bank stocks, meanwhile, stabilised on Friday after several reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. That helped steady the group, a day after tumbling on worries about potentially bad loans. Scrutiny is rising on the quality of loans that banks and other lenders have broadly made following last month\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing of First Brands Group, a supplier of aftermarket auto parts. One of the financial firms that could feel pain because of First Brands\u2019 bankruptcy, Jefferies Financial Group, rose 5.9 per cent on Friday. It had come into the day with a loss of about 30 per cent since mid-September. The question is whether the lenders\u2019 problems are just a collection of one-offs or a signal of something larger threatening the industry. Uncertainty is high following a long stretch where many borrowers were able to stay in business, even with the weight of higher interest rates. And with prices soaring to records for all kinds of investments, the appetite for risk may have become too high. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon addressed the issue on an earnings conference call with analysts last week, warning that \u201cwhen you see one cockroach, there are probably more [...] Everyone should be forewarned on this one.\u201d But Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, said that \u201cbanks make loan loss provisions and typically have plenty of capital to keep the cockroaches from causing structural damage \u2026 Based on earnings and data so far, it looks like this isn\u2019t an infestation.\u201d\n\nLoading In the bond market, Treasury yields steadied following their sharp slides from Thursday, which came as investors rushed into investments seen as safer. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4 per cent from 3.99 per cent late on Thursday. Gold also pulled back from its latest record as more calm seeped through the market. The price for an ounce fell 2.1 per cent to $US4213.30, but it\u2019s still up about 60 per cent for the year so far. Besides worries about tariffs, gold\u2019s price has also surged on expectations for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve and concerns about the massive amounts of debt that the US and other governments worldwide are building. In other international markets, indexes dropped across much of Europe and Asia on Friday. Germany\u2019s DAX lost 1.8 per cent, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng sank 2.5 per cent for two of the world\u2019s bigger moves.",

        "text": "Dimon\u2019s comments, however, resonated because they speak to long-standing concerns about the way the global financial system has developed since the 2008-09 financial crisis. Before that crisis, the financial system was split fairly evenly between banks and non-banks. Since then, while the share of the system held by banks has, according to the Bank for International Settlements, grown from 164 per cent of global GDP to 177 per cent, that of the non-banks has exploded from 167 per cent to 224 per cent. Loading With the banks corralled by increased capital and liquidity requirements, the system is now dominated by asset managers, private equity firms, hedge funds, insurers, private credit providers and other non-bank financiers that are far less regulated and whose activities aren\u2019t anywhere near as transparent. While banks might originate and arrange loans, they now increasingly distribute the debt to non-bank institutions and managed funds rather that hold capital-intensive assets on their own balance sheets.\n\nIn many respects, by distributing risk and diversifying exposures to it, the post-GFC architecture of the system ought to reduce systemic risk. The fear is that the concentrations of risk have just been moved elsewhere and contagion within a particular non-bank sector might still be a threat to overall financial stability. There\u2019s also a concern, evident in the recent corporate failures and the allegations of fraudulent activity, that the responsibility and accountability for assessing credit risks have been diluted by the changes in the way loans are now made. Markets have become concerned about the risks from shadow banking to the financial system. Credit: Bloomberg Banks are less concerned about credit quality when they are passing off the risks to a range of third parties. Non-banks don\u2019t necessarily have the risk-evaluation experience or systems to screen credit risks and, in any case, when holding just a slice of a loan within a diversified portfolio of sliced and diced loans funded by other people\u2019s money, they have less motivation to focus on the risk of the individual tranches of loans someone else has arranged and sold down.\n\nIn a post-GFC, post-pandemic environment of loose monetary policies and easy access to cheap money, credit standards and the pricing of risk have become less top-of-mind. Spreads in the junk bonds market have been compressed to the point where there isn\u2019t that much of a distinction between creditworthy borrowers and the riskiest. Financings have also become more complex. First Brands tapped multiple funding markets, from banks, private credit, the leveraged loan and collateralised debt markets and receivables financing. Loading With too much money from too many sources chasing a finite number of opportunities, it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that underwriting standards are being questioned within a system where there\u2019s no compelling incentive to devote the resources to scrutinising credit quality, when portfolio approaches to risk management with non-bank funds make individual credit risks immaterial. Easy money and competition make for an uneasy and potentially combustible mix, particularly if risks are rather than being concentrated in individual banks or non-banks, concentrated within a sector. That\u2019s why there has been increased discussion about the rate of growth in the private credit sector, the $US2 trillion market for collateralised loan obligations and other forms of leveraged lending.\n\nBank \u201cruns\u201d may have been made less likely by the tougher regulatory regime introduced after the financial crisis \u2013 although the Trump administration is trying to roll back some of that regulation in the US \u2013 but it is conceivable that there could be a contagion-driven a run on non-bank funds if enough \u201ccockroaches\u201d emerge from within the shadow banking sector \u2013 contagion that could have spillover effects for the banking system. While the US Federal Reserve Board has started to cut interest rates, it has also been unwinding the splurges of cheap credit it injected into the system in the aftermath of the financial crisis and, again, in response to the pandemic. Instead of quantitative easing, the system is now experiencing quantitative tightening. Loading It is instructive that banks were accessing the Fed\u2019s short-term lending facility last week, an indication of liquidity pressures, given that they can normally borrow more cheaply in the market. The era of excess credit might be finally nearing its end. The recent spate of corporate collapses \u2013 and the absence of lenders\u2019 due diligence that they suggest \u2013 may be a sign that the non-bank debt market has over-heated and that companies were given credit that they should never have received on terms that didn\u2019t reflect the risk.",

        "text": "It\u2019s a tactic many parents know well: \u201ceat two bites of broccoli, and then you can have dessert\u201d.\n\nIt seems like a practical solution for encouraging kids \u2013 especially picky eaters \u2013 to eat healthy foods. And in the short term, it often works.\n\nBut using food as a bargaining chip can do more harm than good.\n\nWhy food bribes backfire\n\nAlthough well-intentioned, bribing children with treats to eat healthy foods can:\n\nCreate unhealthy associations\n\nStudies show using discretionary foods such as sweets as rewards increases children\u2019s preference for those foods.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOver time, children start to see dessert as the \u201cprize\u201d and vegetables as the \u201cchore\u201d. This skews their perception of food value and can lead to an unhealthy relationship with eating.\n\nBribes also link food with achievement or behaviour, which can foster emotional eating patterns later in life.\n\nDisrupt appetite regulation\n\nChildren are born with the ability to self-regulate how much they eat, based on internal signals between the gut, brain, and hormones. It\u2019s common for appetite to fluctuate \u2013 ravenous one day, uninterested the next \u2013 depending on activity, growth and development.\n\nHowever, food rewards can override these natural cues. When children learn to eat to earn a reward rather than to satisfy hunger, research suggests it can increase the risk of overeating.\n\nIncrease fussy eating\n\nFussy eating is a normal phase in early childhood and typically improves once children start school.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut pressuring children to eat, especially with the promise of a reward, can make them even more resistant to trying new foods. Several studies show food rewards are linked to greater food fussiness over time.\n\nWhat to do instead: evidence-backed strategies\n\nInstead of resorting to bribes, here are research-informed ways to support healthy eating habits in children:\n\n1. Focus on effort, not outcomes\n\nIt can take eight to ten exposures before a child accepts a new food. So keep offering it without pressure.\n\nPraise your child for trying something new, rather than for finishing their plate.\n\nLet them decide whether to eat it \u2013 and how much. The goal is to build positive experiences around food.\n\n2. Pair new foods with familiar favourites\n\nChildren are more likely to try unfamiliar foods when served alongside ones they already enjoy.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSo if your child loves potato chips, try introducing roast carrot \u201corange chippies\u201d as a variation.\n\nOffering the same food in different formats (such as avocado in sushi one day, on crackers another) also increases acceptance.\n\n3. Make healthy food visually appealing\n\nStudies show kids respond better to food presented in fun and colourful ways. Use different shapes, textures, and colours to make meals more inviting \u2013 think fruit skewers, rainbow veggie plates, or \u201cbuild-your-own\u201d meals.\n\n4. Involve children in the kitchen\n\nChildren are more likely to eat food they\u2019ve helped prepare. Even young children can assist with age-appropriate tasks like mixing, measuring, or choosing recipes. Cooking together is not just a learning opportunity, it also builds a sense of ownership and pride.\n\n5. Model the behaviours you want to see\n\nChildren learn by watching. Research shows that when parents regularly eat and enjoy healthy foods in front of their kids, these children have better diets than their peers who don\u2019t see their parents enjoy healthy foods.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nTry to share meals as a family when possible and model the enjoyment of nutritious foods.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWhile bribing children to eat healthy food may offer short-term success, it can undermine their ability to self-regulate, distort their relationship with food, and increase fussiness in the long run.\n\nBut with patience, consistency and positive role modelling, children learn to enjoy a variety of healthy foods \u2013 no bribes required.\n\nNick Fuller is the author of Healthy Parents, Healthy Kids \u2013 Six Steps to Total Family Wellness.

        "text": "When we talk about diversity in business, it\u2019s usually in moral or social terms \u2013 fairness, inclusion and representation. But our new research suggests diversity also pays off in a very practical way: helping companies make better financial and investment decisions.\n\nCompany boards often get the attention in discussions about corporate leadership. Yet much of the real decision-making happens within smaller, specialised board committees \u2013 groups of directors responsible for areas such as audit, risk, remuneration and sustainability.\n\nThese committees are where many of the big investment and governance decisions are debated and ultimately shaped.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOur study looked at the effect of diversity within these board committees across Australia\u2019s 300 largest listed companies (the ASX 300).\n\nThe results were striking. Firms with more diverse committees \u2013 in terms of gender, independence and professional background \u2013 made smarter and more efficient investment decisions.\n\nOur research\n\nTo conduct our research, we built a detailed index to measure how diverse committees really are. This went beyond simple gender counts.\n\nBoard committees are smaller, specialised decision-making groups within a company. Ali mkumbwa/Unsplash\n\nWe considered whether companies had key committees in place, how large they were, the proportion of women, the diversity of professional backgrounds, and the mix of independent and non-executive members.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWe then linked this \u201ccommittee diversity index\u201d to how well companies invested their capital.\n\nIn simple terms, we looked at whether companies were putting their money to productive use. That is, investing in projects that would generate long-term value, not wasteful spending or short-term gambles.\n\nSmarter decisions\n\nAcross our study period (2018\u20132020), the results were consistent. Companies with higher committee diversity achieved better returns on invested capital and returns on equity. Both are measures of how efficiently they use their funds to generate profits.\n\nMore importantly, the benefits appeared in strategic investments, not just in day-to-day operations. Diverse committees were more disciplined and forward-looking when deciding where to allocate resources.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThey were less likely to overinvest when times were good or underinvest when markets turned. Put simply, diversity improved judgement under uncertainty.\n\nA wider lens for decision-making\n\nWhy would having a mix of people around the table make such a difference? It\u2019s likely because complex decisions benefit from a wider range of perspectives.\n\nThink about how a company decides whether to expand into a new market, buy a rival firm, or launch a risky product line. A committee made up of people who share the same background and experience may overlook risks or alternative strategies.\n\nA more diverse group \u2013 bringing together financial experts, engineers, marketers and people with different life experiences \u2013 is more likely to ask hard questions and spot blind spots early.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nOur results suggest this mix leads to less waste and more focus on long-term value. Larger, mixed-experience committees helped avoid over-investment and misallocation of resources. In contrast, smaller or more homogeneous groups were more prone to inefficient decisions and short-term thinking.\n\nSeeing more sides of the story\n\nThese findings add to a growing body of research showing diversity isn\u2019t just a moral imperative but a governance advantage. Studies have linked gender-balanced boards to lower risk-taking, better innovation, and improved financial performance.\n\nDiverse teams of employees also tend to outperform more homogenous ones because they bring different viewpoints to problem-solving.\n\nWhen people with different backgrounds and expertise work together, companies see more sides of the story before committing to a particular path.\n\nDiversity beyond the boardroom\n\nOur findings fit within a wider global conversation about diversity in business leadership. For years, researchers have debated whether diverse boards and workplaces actually perform better financially.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSome studies find strong evidence, others less so \u2013 partly because most research has focused on the main board rather than the specialised committees where many critical investment decisions are actually made.\n\nBut committees are often where the real decisions happen. Audit and risk committees oversee financial integrity; nomination and remuneration committees shape leadership and incentives; sustainability committees increasingly guide long-term strategy.\n\nAs organisations face uncertain markets, economic transitions and growing scrutiny, the ability to see problems from multiple angles is becoming a core strength.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nIn Australia, regulators and investors are placing more emphasis on transparency, governance quality and environmental, social and governance (ESG) accountability.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs these expectations rise, companies are under pressure to show not just that they have diverse boards, but that this diversity extends into their decision-making structures.\n\nFor investors, our research has a clear message: diversity is a signal of sound governance and smarter resource allocation.\n\nFor companies, it\u2019s a reminder that inclusive leadership is more than a reputational box to tick. It\u2019s also a practical way to build resilience and long-term value.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation. It was written by: Adam G.
