        "text": "US President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50 per cent tax on all imports from the European Union as well a 25 per cent tariff on Apple products, unless iPhones are made in America .\n\nThe threats, delivered over social media , reflect Trump's ability to disrupt the global economy with a burst of typing as well as the reality that his tariffs have yet to produce the trade deals he is seeking or the return of domestic manufacturing he has promised voters.\n\nThe Republican president said he wants to charge higher import taxes on goods from the EU, a long-standing US ally, than from China , a geopolitical rival that had its tariffs cut to 30 per cent this month so Washington and Beijing could hold negotiations.\n\nREAD MORE: Young girl hit by car as she attempts to dash across Adelaide road \ufeff\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Friday threatened a 50 per cent tax on all imports from the European Union (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nTrump was upset by the lack of progress in trade talks with the EU, which has proposed mutually cutting tariffs to zero even as the president has publicly insisted on preserving a baseline 10 per cent tax on most imports.\n\n\"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\n\"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50 per cent Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025. There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States.\"\n\nThat post had been preceded by a threat of import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia.\n\nApple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major US companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs.\n\nAs well a 25 per cent tariff on Apple products, unless iPhones are made in America. (Supplied)\n\n\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple to the US.\"\n\nIn response to Trump's tariffs on China, Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones solid in the US during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam.\n\nAfter Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $US1200 ($1859) iPhone would, if made in America, jump in price anywhere from $US1500 to $US3500 ($2325 - $5425).\n\nStocks sold off after Trump's postings, with the S&P 500 index down roughly 0.5 per cent in early Friday afternoon trading.\n\nThe markets have developed a hair trigger sensitivity to the US president's statements, often slumping when he announces high tariffs and rallying when he retreats from those threats.\n\nApple now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major US companies in the White House's crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty (Mark Lennihan/AP)\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump's postings in a Friday interview on the Fox News show America's Newsroom .\n\nBessent said the EU has a \"collective action problem\" because its 27 member states are being represented by \"this one group in Brussels,\" such that the \"underlying countries don't even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf.\"\n\nThe Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple CEO this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the US.\n\nThe core of Trump's argument against the EU is that America runs a \"totally unacceptable\" trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export.\n\nFrom the vantage point of the EU's executive commission, trade with the US is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global centre for finance and technology, the US runs a trade surplus in services with Europe. That offsets some of the trade gap in goods and puts the imbalance at \u20ac48 billion ($84.2 billion).\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU's executive commission has his country's full support in working to \"preserve our access to the American market\".\n\n\"I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,\" Wadephul said in Berlin.\n\n\"So we are still counting on negotiations, and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.\"\n\nTrump aides have said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president's tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims.\n\nNot only could the EU face higher tariffs than China, but the bloc of member states might have been better off by establishing a broad front with China and other countries against Trump's trade policy, said German economist Marcel Fratscher.\n\n\"The strategy of the EU Commission and Germany in the trade conflict with Trump is a total failure,\" Fratscher, the head of the German Institute for Economic Research, said on X.\n\n\"This was a failure you could see coming \u2014 Trump sees Europe's wavering, hesitation and concessions as the weaknesses that they are.\"\n\nMary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the 50 per cent tariffs on Europe are most likely a \"negotiating ploy\" by Trump.\n\nShe said Trump seems to believe that negotiations operate by going to a \"threat point\" that could risk self-harm just to demonstrate how serious he is, in hopes that doing so would produce an agreement.\n\nBut Lovely said that in the long-run Trump's approach \"suggests that the US is an unreliable trading partner, that it operates on whim, not on rule of law.\"\n\nTrump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that carrying favour with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger.\n\nTim Cook, CEO of Apple, looks on from the field prior to Super Bowl LIX between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles at Caesars Superdome on February 09, 2025 in New Orleans, Louisiana. (Jamie Squire/Getty )\n\nHe has essentially told companies such as Walmart to \"eat\" the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs.\n\nHe now appears to deploying a similar degree of pressure to force Apple to accept the higher costs of relocating its supply chains.\n\nTrump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened separate 25 per cent import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes.\n\nUntil recently, the US president repeatedly bragged about the $US500 billion ($775 billion) that Apple in February pledged to invest domestically. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar.\n\n\"I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,\" Trump told the audience.\n\n\"I said to him, 'My friend, I treated you very good. You're coming here with $500 billion, but now I hear you're building all over India. I don't want you building in India.'\"",

(Supplied)\n\nThe father renewed his lease in August last year and copped a rent hike, which brought the weekly total up from $650 to $720.\ufeff\n\nMannan struggled to keep up, but his situation deteriorated after he was hit with a no-grounds eviction notice just two months later.\n\nThe no-grounds eviction notice, seen by 9news.com.au, \ufeffmeant that Mannan was not given a reason why he had to leave, but had 90 days to do so.\n\nMannan said he was blindsided.\n\n\"I just didn't know what to do, literally, because I know how the market is,\" he said.\n\n\"I just was thinking that I was secure, because my rent went up two months ago... the lease period just started.\"\n\nThe surprising housing markets tipped for growth this year View Gallery\n\nMannan was told the owner planned to move in and renovate the home.\n\nBut, in the months after the eviction, he discovered the Riverwood property was back on the market at the same price.\n\n\"They kicked me out, the owner did not move in, and they tried to put the property back in the market, exactly the same price,\" he said.\n\n\"What have I done wrong?\ufeff I was actually hurt. It just felt personal. They just kicked me out for no reason whatsoever.\" \ufeff\n\nAfter some time on the market, the property's rent was reduced to $700 per week.\n\nMannan luckily found another rental just 150 metres down the road from his former address.\n\nIn the end, he lost about $630 of his bond to repairs and over $300 for moving fees.\n\nNew rental reforms that ended no-grounds evictions came into effect in NSW this week.\n\nNow, agents and landlords are required to \ufeffprovide a specific reason for eviction, including a tenant breaching their lease, damaging the property or not paying rent, the landlord wanting to sell the property or the property no longer being used as a rental.\n\nAgents and landlords who fail to comply will be dealt with under the Rental Taskforce. \ufeff\n\n\"For too long, renters have lived with the fear of being kicked out for no reason. That ends today,\" Housing and Homelessness Minister Rose Jackson said earlier this week.\n\nWhile the changes were welcomed by some, Mannan \ufeffsaid he did not believe they would have much material change because landlords could still decide to increase the rent, effectively evicting tenants who cannot afford the hike, or sell the property.\n\n\"I\ufeff know, in the paper and in the books, it looks really nice... but it doesn't secure us. We need more property to be built, it's a simple solution. There's no supply,\" he said.",

(AP)\n\nA new BBC documentary into the disaster gained access to material from the US Coast Guard's (USCG) investigation.\n\nFootage obtained by the USCG shows Wendy Rush, the wife of Rush, listening to the sound of the implosion while watching on from the sub's support vessel and asking: \"What was that bang?\"\n\nShe is shown sitting in front of a computer that was sending and receiving text messages from Titan about 90 minutes in from when it started its dive.\n\nA noise sounding like a door slamming is heard when the submersible reaches a depth of 3300 metres, prompting her to look up and ask other OceanGate crew what the noise was.\n\nMoments later, Wendy Rush receives a text message from the sub saying it had dropped two weights, which apparently caused her to mistakenly believe the dive was proceeding safely.\n\nBut the USCG says the noise was in fact the sound of Titan imploding.\n\nOfficials say the text message, which must have been sent just before the sub hit disaster, took longer to reach the ship than the sound of the implosion.\n\nThe five aboard were, from left, pilot Stockton Rush, the CEO of OceanGate; French explorer and Titanic expert Paul-Henry Nargeolet\ufeff; British adventurer and billionaire Hamish Harding; and Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his son Suleman. (9News)\n\nStockton Rush and the four other people aboard - businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son, Suleman Dawood; businessman Hamish Harding; and French diver Paul-Henri Nargeolet - died instantly.\n\nEarlier this year at the USCG hearings into the disaster, a damning portrait of the Washington-based company that developed and operated the submersible as well as its founder \u2013 who charged passengers about $US250,000 (nearly $400,000) per dive - emerged from testimonies.\n\nAfter the submersible lost contact with its mother ship and failed to resurface, a dramatic international search and rescue mission unfolded in the remote waters several hundred kilometres south-east of Newfoundland.\n\nAuthorities concluded the vessel had suffered a \"catastrophic implosion,\" a sudden inward collapse caused by immense pressure.\n\nThe USGC investigation has centred on the design of the Titan, built from carbon fibre, an unusual material for deep sea submersible crafts.\n\nRemains of the Titan submersible on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. (US Coast Guard Video via Pelagic Research Services)\n\nA known problem is that carbon fibre layers can separate under pressure, a process called delamination.\n\nUSGC investigators believe the Titan's structure showed signs of weakening in 2022 after the craft completed its 80th expedition.\n\nPassengers reported hearing a loud bang as the sub returned to the surface.\n\nThey were told by Stockton Rush that this noise was the sub shifting in its frame.\n\nBut the USCG says the data collected from sensors fitted to Titan shows that the bang was caused by delamination.\n\nThe US Coast Guard will publish a final report bout its investigation later this year.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP : Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

(ABC Landline)\n\nWhile the US and China have walked back from the trade war precipice in recent weeks with a 90-day pause on tariffs, Mr Davis said the friction between the two nations was on show at the SIAL food trade show in Shanghai.\n\n\"Our pavilion at SIAL, we had 300 square metres of space and we were swamped with buyers the whole time,\" he said.\n\n\"Right next to it was the United States pavilion which was very quiet, very subdued, and most of the US exhibitors didn't send people over from the United States.\n\n\" So it was a very stark difference between the Australian and Unites States' pavilions on this occasion. \"\n\nSIAL Shanghai is one of the world's biggest food and beverage trade shows. (Supplied: MLA)\n\nMr Davis, who is based in Shanghai, said the fundamentals for Australia's beef trade with China were strong.\n\n\"There are some economic headwinds here, in that consumer sentiment is a little bit subdued, the stock market is down, property prices are down, but it still remains a 200,000-tonne-a-year [beef] market for us,\" he said.\n\n\"I think no matter what, it's going to remain a very significant market for us in the future.\"\n\nAACo beef sales strong\n\nMeanwhile, Australia's largest cattle company's financial year results, released this week, included plenty of green shoots.\n\nAustralian Agricultural Company (AACo) posted an operating profit of $58.4 million, up 14 per cent year-on-year and its total revenue increased 15 per cent to $389.9 million.\n\nChief executive David Harris said it was a positive outcome during a period of global uncertainty.\n\nLoading...\n\nHe said despite Trump's 10 per cent tariff, North America remained AACo's second-biggest market for its branded beef.\n\n\"Business has been good [with the United States],\" he said.\n\n\"There is no doubting there's been lots of conversations between importers, distributors, customers and ourselves in relation to the tariff.\n\n\" But demand over there is strong, local supply in the US is very short, and I think the opportunities in the US are really good [in the] short-to-medium term. \"\n\nMr Harris said while AACo did export some beef to China, it was not a major customer for its brands.\n\n\"We're not over-leveraged into China, but because it moves volumes of beef out of other markets, that certainly helps us in other global markets.\"\n\nCattle have been pouring into southern saleyards this year because of drought. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\nAustralia is on track to produce a record amount of beef in 2025.\n\nData from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) this week showed 2.2 million head of cattle were killed in the first quarter of 2025, up an incredible 20 per cent on the same period last year.\n\nWatch ABC TV's Landline at 12:30pm on Sunday or on ABC iview.",

(Supplied: Terry Kiley)\n\nPeak grower organisation Grain Producers Australia (GPA) said it had received numerous reports of fertiliser quality problems this season.\n\n\"Our members have certainly raised concerns about the quality of product,\" said GPA chief executive Colin Bettles.\n\n\"We're looking at what options we have to take action on it and we're engaging with [industry group] Fertilizer Australia.\"\n\nMr Bettles urged affected farmers to document the problems and speak to their suppliers.\n\n\"The main thing is to record, take pictures, and go back to your supplier and raise the issue with them,\" he said.\n\nMr Bettles said farmers have reported problems with fertiliser this season. (Supplied: Colin Bettles)\n\nSuppliers warn farmers against storing fertiliser in silos, given the risk it can set hard, instead advising them to store it in sheds.\n\nBut manufacturers still market fertiliser-specific silos, and many farmers buy them because they are cheaper and more practical.\n\nMr Kiley's fertiliser was imported by Koch Fertiliser Australia.\n\nHe contacted the company to report the problems but said he was frustrated by their response.\n\n\"The blend we ran into issues with we've been using [without problems] for probably 25 years,\" Mr Kiley said.\n\n\"It's got to be a quality issue, but they just cover their arse by telling you not to store it in silos.\"\n\n'A one-off case'\n\nIn the NSW central west at Forbes, grain grower Jarrod Amery has had endless headaches handling fertiliser this sowing season.\n\n\"We had one particular load that was a shocker,\" he said.\n\n\"We had to get professionals in from 500 kilometres away with pneumatic vibrators to vibrate the base of the silo and try and get the fertiliser out,\" he said.\n\nHe said he believed the underlying issues were twofold \u2014 high moisture and a lot of fine particles.\n\nNot only has the fertiliser destroyed his silo it's also blocking up his air seeder.\n\n\"We're only getting three or four hectares of sowing done and the rollers are starting to block up, so it's been a challenge,\" he said.\n\nJarrod Amery's silo has buckled under the weight of fertiliser that clumped together and would not run out. (Supplied: Jarrod Amery)\n\nMr Amery's fertiliser was also imported by Koch Fertiliser Australia.\n\nWhen he first went to the company about the problems, he said he was told his issues were isolated.\n\n\"Well I pushed pretty hard on that,\" he said.\n\nKoch Fertiliser Australia declined ABC Rural's request for an interview to discuss the concerns.\n\nIn a statement, managing director Ross York confirmed it had received reports about issues with its products.\n\nBut he reiterated that farmers were advised not to use silos for fertiliser.\n\n\"As stated on our label and our website we encourage farmers not to store bulk fertilisers in field bins or silos,\" he said.\n\n\"The hygroscopic nature of these products can prevent their free-flowing and may lead to the collapse of the field bin or silo.\"\n\nFertiliser has formed a cliff face inside Jarrod Amery's silo. (Supplied: Jarrod Amery)\n\nSilos used at farmers 'own risk'\n\nAccording to Fertilizer Australia about 5.4 million tonnes of fertiliser is used in Australia each year.\n\nSome is manufactured in Australia and the rest is imported from overseas including China, the Middle East, Morocco and South America.\n\nFertilizer Australia's executive manager Stephen Annells backed Koch's position about on-farm storage for fertiliser.\n\n\"We've always held a very strong position that we recommend fertiliser shouldn't be placed in silos and really that growers do that at their own risk,\" he said.\n\n\" Fertiliser is very different to grain, it risks compacting. So we say it is just safer to not store it in a silo. \"",

(ABC News: Brooke Tindall)\n\nIn a statement, Racing Queensland said Oakley and the Tower Hill Amateur Race Club, which hosts a sister-event in April, had opted not to renew their licences due to Licensed Venue Standards that came into effect in May last year.\n\nThe standards dictate what facilities are required for race meetings to be conducted under a Racing Queensland licence.\n\nThey include the condition of the track, car parks, horse stalls, mounting yards, veterinary facilities, steward and jockey rooms, and race calling towers.\n\n\"Following the expiration of their licences \u2026 RQ met with representatives of both clubs to discuss their future direction,\" the Racing Queensland spokesperson said.\n\n\"Both clubs subsequently advised RQ that in order to preserve the nature of their grassroots racing, rather than change their operations and upgrade facilities to comply with the Licensed Venue Standards, they would not elect to be re-licensed.\"\n\nTower Hill Amateur Race Club, which hosts the other grass-fed horseracing meet in Queensland, has also given up its licence. (Supplied)\n\nAnnouncing their decision on social media, the Tower Hill Amateur Race Club said it was not made lightly.\n\n\"We are so incredibly passionate about our bush racing, it's a love many of us have been born into,\" the club said in a statement.\n\n\"Others have come to a race meeting and have never left because they love what we represent.\"\n\nWithout a licence, the clubs can no longer access funding and public liability insurance provided by Racing Queensland.\n\nThe Tower Hill Picnic Amateur Races have been held in western Queensland since 1909. (Supplied: Ruth Bode)\n\nFor the Oakley club, the decision not to renew means they had to pay a $30,000 insurance bill themselves, but Mr Larkin said keeping the tradition alive outweighed the cost.\n\n\"We're grass fed, these horses live out in the paddock, we're not like other clubs on the coast,\" he said.\n\n\"It's why we are different, and we want to keep it that way.\"\n\nFeeding tradition\n\nGrass-fed racing horses are often older rejects from the main racing competitions, that graze in paddocks on nearby farms.\n\n\"These horses are getting rehomed to us, where we can give them another four or five years of just good living and good racing,\" Mr Larkin said.\n\nThey also don't use barriers to start the race \u2014 instead, they use a flag start, where the horses trot up to the line together, a flag is lowered, and the race begins.\n\nThe day is filled with a lot of excitement for children. (ABC News: Brooke Tindall)\n\nAlong with the horse shelters, Mr Larkin said the conditions to renew their licence with Racing Queensland included removing the flag start, which he said would completely change the competition.\n\nRacing Queensland said it provided $3 million a year through its Country Club Asset Funding program to assist country racing clubs to repair, maintain and replace facilities.\n\nDespite severing ties with the governing body, the club said it would maintain the racing standards set when it held a licence.\n\nAmong those determined to keep the tradition alive is jockey Cameron Creevey.\n\nJockey Cameron Creevey is cheered on by his Mum. (ABC News: Brooke Tindall)\n\nHe said small country race meets gave him the chance to fulfil his passion for horse racing.\n\n\"It's the going fast bit for me, it's a good adrenaline rush and I just love it,\" Mr Creevey said.\n\nA much-loved social event, he said the country race meet was about much more than just horses.\n\n\"It's great just to meet people and have a few beers together,\" he said.\n\nCam Tindall's parents became involved with the club in the 1950s, and he's continuing the family legacy. (ABC News: Brooke Tindall)\n\nMore than just horses\n\nMr Larkin said the Koorooinya races provided a wonderful opportunity for remote farming communities to get together.\n\n\"It's all about having three days off in a bush area,\" Mr Larkin said.\n\n\"It's just something we look forward to year in, year out.\n\n\"Our kids love it, and if we were going to miss one, I tell you what, we wouldn't have a very happy family in our household.\"\n\nMinister for Racing Tim Mander says it's important to maintain the viability of country race meets. (ABC Western Qld: Grace Nakamura )\n\nIn March, the Queensland Government announced a \"landmark review\" of the state's racing industry, covering thoroughbred, harness and greyhound racing.\n\nIt appointed former chair of the Australian Turf Club Matthew McGrath as the chair.\n\n\u201cFrom our biggest cities to our smallest and most remote towns, racing brings our communities together,\" Minister for Sport and Racing Tim Mander said at the time.\n\n\"We want to ensure the long-term financial stability, viability, and integrity of racing in the state.\"\n\nMore than 1,200 submissions were made on the discussion paper, which included looking at the need for \"fit-for-purpose infrastructure\" statewide and safeguarding country racing.\n\n\"It's important that we get this right, so racing will continue to flourish and grow for decades to come,\" Mr Mander said.\n\nThe final review is expected to be delivered in late 2025.",

        "text": "Disney's 2002 animation Lilo & Stitch became an instant classic for one reason: its originality.\n\nFast Facts about Lilo & Stitch What: A live-action remake of Disney's 2002 animation about a cheeky blue alien who befriends a lonely Hawaiian girl. Directed by: Chris Sanders Starring: Sydney Agudong, Maia Kealoha, Zach Galifianakis, Billy Magnussen, Tia Carrere, Hannah Waddingham Released: In cinemas now Likely to make you feel: Like watching the original \u2014 or hugging your sister\n\nFor Disney, it was a step away from its usual style. It took a sci-fi alien story and transported it to modern Hawai'i, where it explored the everyday struggles of the people who lived there.\n\nWith hand-drawn 2D animation in the distinctive style of Chris Sanders (who last year directed the Oscar-nominated film The Wild Robot), it had a fresh look that was new for the studio, including round faces and larger bodies.\n\nIt was also one of the first mainstream films to platform and celebrate Hawaiian culture, putting locals at the forefront rather than using the archipelago as a cheap backdrop.\n\nAnd, critically, it subtly criticised the ways in which mass over-tourism has affected native Hawaiians.\n\nA live-action remake, set in our time, was a chance to take the elements that made the original so groundbreaking, and add layers of modernity to them.\n\nMaybe Lilo and Nani are surrounded by Airbnbs now? Or perhaps Stitch can attempt his dream of destroying a large city, given how built-up modern Honolulu is? Could Pleakley do a drag rendition of a Chappell Roan song?\n\nBut instead of adding to the original's cultural commentary, the new film completely cuts this element out.\n\nIt's the latest release to follow the apparent new recipe for a modern kids' movie: sanitise everything that could possibly offend anyone, replace the personalised hand-drawn animation with expensive, photo-realistic CGI, add in a little slapstick and a Bruno Mars song, and you've got yourself a hit.\n\nWhat is Lilo & Stitch about?\n\nBoth films follow the same initial plot: Nani has been her sister Lilo's guardian since their parents died, but is struggling with the responsibility. Repeated visits from a social worker are not going well, and separation seems imminent.\n\nMeanwhile, far from earth, experiment 626 \u2014 who was made in a lab by Jumba the mad scientist/evil genius \u2014 has escaped.\n\nExperiment 626 \u2014 dangerous escapee or cuddly pet? (Supplied: Disney)\n\nHe soon lands on the sisters' Hawaiian island, and Jumba is tasked with re-capturing his monster, aided by Pleakley, a self-proclaimed \"Earth expert\".\n\nWhen Lilo adopts experiment 626 \u2014 and names him Stitch \u2014 the real mayhem begins.\n\nWhat made Lilo & Stitch so significant?\n\nWe first met Nani and Lilo in 2002, trying their best on their island home overrun by an invasive species: tourists \u2014 and then, also, aliens.\n\nIn the original's opening scene, Lilo snaps a photo of a sunburnt tourist, and we later discover she keeps an extensive series of these on her bedroom wall.\n\nThis was well ahead of the public discourse condemning western holiday-makers who make a habit of photographing foreign children.\n\nTourists are poked fun at throughout the 2002 film. (Disney)\n\nWe also see Nani and Lilo's rundown house, and how Nani's only employment options are in the service and tourism industry; \"I just love to answer phones!\" she enthusiastically tells a hotel manager.\n\nBut where the original criticised, the remake glorifies.\n\nPleakley soaks in a lavish hotel bubble bath overlooking the ocean, while Lilo frequently enjoys the beachside hot tub, with the resort's portrayal closer to advertisement than critique.\n\nThe new Lilo & Stitch doesn't seem to have an issue with the impact of tourism on Hawai'i. (Disney)\n\nWhile Hawaiian culture is still respected \u2014 with a local behind the script \u2014 none of that cultural commentary remains, and the movie has less impact without it.\n\nAre there songs in the live-action Lilo & Stitch?\n\nThe music of the original film has become iconic, with clips of Mark Keali\u02bbi Ho\u02bbomalu and the Kamehameha Schools Children's Chorus in the recording studio regularly going viral online.\n\nLoading TikTok content\n\nAnd rather than reducing the hula to women in coconut bikinis swaying their hips, the production team took care to reflect the cultural and spiritual significance of the traditional dance, with animators recreating it frame by frame.\n\nThe new film brings these elements back, with audiences treated to a real on-screen hula, as well as the bright young voices of today's Kamehameha Schools Children's Chorus choir.\n\nThe youth chorus's conductor, Lynell Bright, returned 25 years later too, and in a full-circle moment, her son Chris Kekaniokalani Bright is one of the screenwriters behind the adaptation.\n\nActress and musician Sydney Agudong gives a beautiful rendition of Aloha 'Oe. (Disney)\n\nThankfully, they kept in a rendition of 'Aloha 'Oe', which Nani sings to Lilo when they think they might be separated.\n\nThis legendary folk song was written in 1878 by Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani, the last sovereign monarch of Hawaii, who dedicated her life to the restoration of rights for Hawaiian people after the illegal US takeover of the territory.\n\nA positive addition to the live-action is the expansion of Ohana, a memorable theme of the original: \"Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten.\"\n\nWith added characters in the new film, Ohana is expanded to not just include direct blood relatives, but also a community, which does serve the film's focus on non-traditional families.\n\nWhat does the live-action Lilo & Stitch change?\n\nThe film's key change is, of course, its lack of animation. The CGI version of Stitch looks perfect, while Jumba and Pleakley disguise themselves as humans for the majority of the piece. Jumba is portrayed as a generic evil villain, rather than a screwball scientist, which doesn't quite work.\n\nJumba (right) and Pleakley (left) wear slightly more convincing human disguises in the live-action version. (Disney)\n\nThe setting has been shifted from the original's natural oasis of Kauai, and now takes place on the more built-up Oahu, focusing on locations like Waikiki Beach and Honolulu. The fact that this seemingly contradicts Stitch's struggle to find a big city to destroy on a remote island is glossed over.\n\nNani's experience as Lilo's carer is explored in greater detail, with dreams of going to study marine biology quashed by her new-found responsibility.\n\nWhile there's a lot added in detail, there's not a great deal more depth or humour. The softened language of the script means much of the raw emotion of the original is lost, too.\n\nThe best new addition to the film is probably Jumba and Pleakley's portal gun, which creates gateways anywhere you shoot it, and soon becomes a fun, non-violent plot device.\n\nLoading TikTok content\n\nBut sorely missed by audiences is Pleakley's obsession with wigs, women's clothes and make-up.\n\nThis infatuation \u2014 which continued throughout the animated franchise's sequels and TV spin-offs \u2014 made him a favourite among audiences, with some fans calling the character \"a gender-fluid icon\".\n\nThe closest director Dean Fleischer Camp got to Pleakley in drag was Pleakley in a flowered shirt. (TikTok: @marceltheshellwshoeson)\n\nQueer-coded or otherwise, Pleakley's love for cross-dressing was a key element of the character, and the film's director has hinted at pushback from Disney against its inclusion, responding to criticism with: \"I tried.\"\n\nHow long is the Lilo & Stitch movie, and is it worth watching?\n\nWhile the original's run time was just under 90 minutes, the additional characters and plot in the live-action remake put it closer to two hours.\n\nDespite being made for a generation with the attention span of a YouTube video, the film does feel slow in parts, and younger or more energetic children may find it difficult to sit through.\n\nLike many recent live-action remakes of a beloved classic, the new Lilo & Stitch is wholly OK \u2014 if a little uninspired \u2014 and isn't a difficult watch for parents. It's devoid of annoying characters with high-pitched voices, and would make for a decent outing on a rainy weekend.\n\nPerhaps unavoidably, devout fans are furious at the changes. But, overall, it's an inoffensive film, in every sense of the word.",

But we stayed, as you know, 23 days,\" Ms Gitton said.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe couple spent Easter with the Jenkins family, attended local sport and became fast friends with their Australian host family.\n\nIn a town of about 1,500 people it did not take long for word to spread about the stranded \"Frenchies\".\n\nThe community spirit from Nannup locals was not something the Parisian couple had ever experienced before.\n\n\"It was crazy to see how many people wanted to help us with donations,\" Ms Gitton said.\n\n\"When we went to the town and the church a lot of people were just like 'oh, you're the French people'. It was really nice to see. We got a lot of love messages and a lot of help.\"\n\n'I will never forget'\n\nMr Crepinior said he was blown away by the kindness of strangers.\n\n\"We have never met those people and they're just helping us,\" he said.\n\n\"I think without this kangaroo we would never know about Nannup.

They had used most of their money buying this car.\n\n\" They were literally driving to pick up a roo bar. \"\n\nThe town of Nannup, where kangaroos and emus are a common site, became the travellers' second home. (ABC South West WA: Anthony Pancia)\n\nShe said her husband, despite not being a mechanic or a panelbeater, helped Mr Crepinior fix the car.\n\n\"Neither of them had done it before but they worked it out together.

        "text": "The NSW government has launched a new approach to renewable energy in the Illawarra, pitching the region as the state's first \"urban renewable energy zone\".\n\nThe model leans heavily on local solar, community batteries, and existing infrastructure rather than large-scale projects.\n\nEnergy Minister Penny Sharpe said the plan marked a shift from traditional renewable energy zones (REZs) in places like the Orana and South West.\n\n\"It's not about big generation and transmission,\" she said.\n\n\"It's about how we support the infrastructure that's already here, how we prepare for green manufacturing, and how we make the most of the solar and storage potential across homes, businesses and communities.\"\n\nThe announcement in Port Kembla at the BlueScope steel terminal \u2014 where renewable energy research is underway \u2014 included a memorandum of understanding with Endeavour Energy.\n\nIt set the groundwork for trials of new grid technologies and incentives for solar uptake.\n\nEndeavour's Colin Crisafulli said the goal was to make the most of the infrastructure already in place.\n\n\"We're looking at how we can store more energy, share it locally, and avoid rebuilding the grid where we don't need to,\" he said.\n\n'Bigger mix' of renewables needed\n\nAt the University of Wollongong, energy researcher Ty Christopher said the consumer focus in the REZ could deliver 300 megawatts of local energy.\n\nThe Illawarra REZ Roundtable met at the University of Wollongong with energy experts, business leaders and community representatives to map out the next steps. (ABC Illawarra: Kelly Fuller)\n\n\"An urban REZ could certainly get it into the hundreds of megawatts of capacity,\" he said.\n\n\"With more generation on homes and businesses, and in particular with the ability to store and time shift all of that clean energy so that it's available in the evening .\"\n\nHe said leaning into the local support for renewables with an urban REZ would \"really play to the strengths of the region\".\n\nEven with the local consumer energy contributions, the government is still a way off its commitment of 1 gigawatt of energy creation for the Illawarra zone.\n\nProfessor Christopher said the local REZ would still require bigger solutions like offshore wind to power heavy industry like BlueScope.\n\n\"You can't run a steelworks on rooftop solar,\" he said.\n\n\"This needs to be part of a bigger mix, but this is something we can start now.\n\n\"One of the big challenges from a political perspective with the Urban REZ concept is it's not going to create one big thing that you can string a ribbon in front of and just cut.\n\n\" It's lots of small initiatives happening in our daily lives. \"\n\nThe announcement came just days after the federal government lifted a pause on consultation for offshore wind off the Illawarra coast.\n\nThe applicant, BlueFloat, told the ABC it was not discussing the Illawarra project but focused on its plans for the Gippsland offshore wind zone.\n\n'Thrilled' with announcement\n\nHi Neighbour founder Yael Stone, who earlier this year criticised the lack of visible progress since the Illawarra REZ was first announced, welcomed the urban REZ approach as a smart and community-led next step.\n\nPush for better renewable engagement Photo shows A row of solar panels are stood in the ground above red dirt Locals in renewable energy hotspots say they have been forced to create their own information groups to address concerns about the rapid energy transition and want the government to pitch in.\n\n\"I'm thrilled at the announcement,\" she said.\n\n\"It reflects what groups like Electrify 2515 and Hi Neighbour have been working toward \u2014 small-scale, local energy projects that create jobs and cut bills.\"\n\nShe said Illawarra residents were already tuned in to the benefits of household solar, batteries and smarter grid interaction.\n\n\"People understand their bills, they understand how a battery helps them save, and they're ready to be part of this,\" she said.\n\nStone saw the urban REZ concept as a \"companion piece\" to the federal move to resume offshore wind planning and said her group had already helped install solar on local manufacturing rooftops, using the returns to fund training scholarships.\n\n\"There's a kind of circularity that feeds itself \u2014 these projects create economic benefit and they enrich communities,\" she said.",

        "text": "US 10-year Treasury bonds have long been considered \"risk-free\" \u2014 until now.\n\nThat's put the usually circumspect Reserve Bank of Australia \"on alert\" for a potentially \"cataclysmic\" economic event.\n\nUp until now, if you gave the US government money over a 10-year period, you were, essentially, certain to get your money back with interest, on average, 4.25 per cent.\n\nThat's known as the yield or interest rate.\n\nThe return on this debt security is so stable and secure, many other securities are priced off it, including US mortgage securities.\n\nSo, what happens if US bonds, or debt, become riskier, and investors demand a higher return?\n\nThe answer is that the global financial system fundamentally changes, and that affects every Australian.\n\nTrump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' has investors worried about the US\n\nThe bond market is now regularly questioning the value and stability of US government debt.\n\nThat has not happened in the post-World War II era.\n\nThis week's Donald Trump's so-called Big Beautiful Bill is the latest catalyst to rile bond markets.\n\nIn the lead-up to the passage of the bill through the US House of Representatives, the US Treasury Department tried to secure $16 billion of funding through the sale of 20-year bonds.\n\nIt found the auction harder than usual to execute due to a lack of demand from investors.\n\nInvestors are wary because President Donald Trump's tax bill is projected to add $3 trillion to $5 trillion to the US debt over the next 10 years.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe passing of the bill through the US House of Representatives, by just one vote, saw bond yields soar on Thursday night (Australian time).\n\n\"Over the last few years \u2026 we've gone through one of the biggest inflation periods and rate hiking cycles in decades,\" Jamieson Coote Bonds senior portfolio manager James Wilson said.\n\nThe bond market is flashing red and market turbulence is far from over Photo shows A close up of Donald Trump's face as he looks over his shoulder with a casual expression. US Treasury bond yields are surging again because investors are selling bonds and using the cash to buy stocks, with a renewed sense of optimism about the future.\n\n\"Since the 1990s, in all that time, if we think back, there's been a shocking narrative about higher yields.\n\n\"In reality, the 10-year US Treasury yield has] traded above 5 per cent only once and that was back in October 2023 and it lasted there for about 5 to 6 hours,\" he said.\n\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield is yet to trade above 5 per cent this year. It's currently above 4.5 per cent.\n\nBut when the passage of Trump's bill hit trading terminals across the globe, the 30-year Treasury bond yield touched a level not seen since 2007, of 5.13 per cent.\n\nThe catalyst for the latest round of selling was Moody's downgrade of US debt from Aaa to Aa1.\n\nMoody's downgrade said, ever-so-subtly, US debt had become riskier for the lender.\n\nIt clearly has.\n\nGlobal increase in yields hurts economic activity\n\nBut how does it affect you?\n\nThe problem is that many assets and securities across the globe use US Treasury bonds as a reference rate.\n\nPut simply, the more yields rise for US bonds, the higher the borrowing costs for US businesses and households.\n\nThis makes it increasingly difficult for big US corporations to raise funds and grow their profits and may lead to US consumers pulling back on their spending.\n\n\"So, if we think about the global cost of capital, the 10-year US Treasury is the benchmark,\" James Wilson said.\n\n\"It gets used for corporate lending, it gets used for sovereign lending \u2014 so where the government can borrow money, and it gets used for mortgages.\"\n\nIn short, if US government bond yields continue to rise, it risks pushing the US into recession.\n\nDonald Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" is part of his grand plan for extensive tax cuts. (Reuters: Nathan Howard)\n\nThis would affect both Chinese and Australian economic growth, and therefore employment.\n\nThis would be compounded if both bond and share markets fell together. Given that shares are valued, in part, against the \"risk-free\" return that can be obtained from US Treasuries, rising yields tend to put downward pressure on share prices because investors demand a higher return.\n\n\"So, especially when both bonds and equities are both falling in price, this is tightening funding conditions,\" Barrenjoey's interest rate strategist Andrew Lilley said.\n\n\"And also [it's going to cost more] if you then go to the debt market while you're paying more.\n\n\"That's the way in which this kind of reinforces itself.\"\n\nHe says, \"at the margin\", higher US bond yields \"could push the Reserve Bank to cut the cash rate, if long-dated yields keep climbing.\"\n\nThis would be to support Australian businesses borrowing from the US, and the economy more broadly.\n\n\"Basically, the higher long-term funding costs are the lower the RBA needs to make [the cash rate].\n\n\"That's the simplest way of putting it.\"\n\nLoading\n\nRBA 'paid to worry' about 'cataclysmic' events\n\nThe Reserve Bank is known for its understated commentary.\n\nNot so this week.\n\nIt made it clear to everyone that the Monetary Policy Board's decision to cut the cash rate from 4.1 per cent to 3.85 per cent was due in some part to the small but rising risk of a \"severe downside scenario\".\n\nGovernor Michele Bullock was asked if that included a \"cataclysmic\" financial markets event, and a recession.\n\n\"Well, yes,\" she responded, \"we are on the alert for that, and we're paid to worry about that sort of thing.\"\n\nThe Reserve Bank is watching and 'worrying' about a cataclysmic economic event. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\n\"And we have been watching that very closely as have other central banks all around the world.\n\n\"I'm not putting a strong possibility on a really, really bad outcome, but I think we have to be alert that there might be [one].\n\n\"[And] if you look at our scenario analysis, it does suggest that in a really bad outcome there could possibly be an [Australian] recession, yes, but that's in the very extreme,\" Bullock said.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has already shifted its unemployment rate forecast up slightly to peak at 4.3 per cent. It's currently 4.1 per cent.\n\n\"Look, without a doubt that the Reserve Bank is quite worried about the global growth story,\" James Wilson said.\n\nIt all comes back to Trump, how his tariff policy will play out, the future credibility of US sovereign debt, and how financial markets ultimately respond to ongoing confusion about the global economic outlook.\n\n\"If we are in the middle of a government debt crisis, it's something that's been brewing for 25 years,\" Barrenjoey's Andrew Lilley said.\n\n\"And nothing in the last week has really accelerated that.\n\n\"But the attention [on ballooning US government debt] just becomes salient to everybody at the same time and everybody starts saying well these government bond yields need to be higher and it's not because of the news, but it's because of the new attention.\"\n\nThe suggestion is that US government borrowing has been on an unsustainable path now for decades.\n\nEnter Donald Trump, and the true scale of the fiscal crisis is being realised.",

        "text": "A quiet room with mood lighting, bean bags, lollipops and fidget toys may seem antithetical to emergency medical treatment \u2014 but for some patients in Canberra, it's non-negotiable.\n\nThat's the case for autistic 13-year-old Max Fenton, a regular at the Canberra Hospital's Emergency Department (ED) who has a list of sensory aids he brings along to each visit.\n\n\"I get to have something to fidget in my hand, which helps me focus,\" Max said.\n\n\"And [sensory stuffed toy] Jerry \u2014 he is mostly just moral support.\"\n\nMax Fenton has been bringing sensory aids to Canberra Hospital for years. (Supplied: Annabell Fenton)\n\nBorn with multiple organ failure, including an enlarged heart requiring specialist care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Max said he's \"nearly been raised\" at the Canberra Hospital.\n\n\"I've had to have so many check-ups, I've lost count of how many,\" Max said.\n\n\"Max experienced complications with intra-uterine growth restriction, which is when a baby in the womb does not grow as expected,\" Max's mother, Annabell Fenton, said.\n\nNeurotypical 'attitudes, practices and structures' create barriers for autistic people\n\nMax was first diagnosed as autistic at four, and was assessed as having relatively low support needs, but three years later \u2014 when the presentation of his traits changed as he got older \u2014 he was re-evaluated and rediagnosed as having higher support needs.\n\nIt's thought 290,000 Australians have an autism diagnosis, though the true number is estimated to be much higher.\n\nA national autism strategy, launched in January, notes \"attitudes, practices and structures in a neurotypical world can create barriers that impact on autistic people being able to participate fully and equally in the community\".\n\nThe government has pledged $42.3 million to implement the first phase of the seven-year strategy, which includes the provision of more accessible and sensory-friendly public places.\n\nMax Fenton says he often found attending Canberra Hospital to be a noisy, awkward, and uncomfortable experience. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nAutism exists on a spectrum, and autistic people experience sensory inputs differently, but many are highly sensitive \u2014 and anywhere with unfamiliar people, loud noises, bright lights, and strong smells can be overwhelming.\n\n\"I hear every single noise,\" Max said.\n\n\" And I mean, like, every single little, tiny noise. \"\n\nWithout noise-cancelling headphones, \"all the noises just come rushing in at once\".\n\n\"Then it's just all loud and \u2026 it's just \u2026 overwhelming,\" Max said.\n\n\"It's very difficult for me to pay attention sometimes and listen. I get tired easily.\"\n\nSensory differences can make hospital environment overwhelming\n\nDr Alison Lally of the Canberra Hospital says overstimulation or hypersensitivity can be clinically risky on top of a patient's reason for presenting to the ED. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nDr Alison Lally, a Canberra Hospital emergency consultant, said a hospital setting can often turn up the volume on this kind of discomfort.\n\n\"You have different people, dressed in different colours, coming to do things,\" Dr Lally said.\n\n\"[They're] checking blood pressure, get a little prick on the finger to check blood sugar, ask you to step on some scales, and give you some medicine.\"\n\nSuch overstimulation or hypersensitivity, on top of a patient's reason for presenting to the ED, can also be clinically risky.\n\n\"Autistic kids \u2026 get dysregulated or start to become quite heightened,\" Dr Lally said.\n\n\"That results in things like a high heart rate, they start pacing, they start getting really anxious.\"\n\nMax Fenton sometimes experiences shutdowns after having surgery. (ABC News: Tobias Hunt)\n\nMs Fenton said Max will often \"go into shutdown\" post-surgery.\n\n\"He may have a period of being, basically, non-responsive for quite a number of days,\" she said.\n\n\"A shutdown is when I [give] no response,\" Max said.\n\n\"I'm just, like, on the desk face-first.\n\n\"You try to shake me \u2014 does not work. You try everything \u2014 does not work. I'm just out cold.\"\n\n'We have to do better' for neurodivergent kids\n\nThe Canberra Hospital's Neurodiversity Distraction Trolley has tools to help patients with both tactile and oral sensory needs, and acts as a distraction tool. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nDoctor Lally said her experience taking her now-10-year-old autistic son to the ED inspired advocacy \"for improved care for all kids but, in particular, our complex care kids and also neurodivergent kids\".\n\n\"Even though I know people here [and] I came prepared with headphones and an iPad [for my son], just the whole environment was really overwhelming,\" Dr Lally said.\n\n\"The lights are really bright, the procedure room was really small. We also have a lot of noise.\n\n\"It's quite unpredictable \u2026 lots of people coming and going, doors opening and closing. From there, I went, 'We have to do better'.\"\n\nInitial efforts involved staff education and environmental adjustments.\n\nThat included things like minimising noise where possible and reducing the lights, because many neurodivergent people are hypersensitive to light \u2014 in particular fluorescent lights.\n\nDr Alison Lally says dimming the lights, turning off unnecessary monitors, and minimising the number of staff was helpful.. (ABC News)\n\nA medical supply trolley was re-purposed, stocked with sensory tools and toys that could help staff provide inclusive care anytime, anywhere.\n\nDr Lally said the trolley includes aids based on each sense, with things like noise-cancelling earmuffs, colouring books, and Play-Doh.\n\n\"Just that ongoing squeezing of something [like Play-Doh] really helps. We also got iPads [and] some distraction tools, and little fidget toys,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not for all kids, but some kids do actually respond quite well to that [combination].\n\n\"Usually, just dimming the lights, turning off [unnecessary] monitors, and as minimal staff as clinically required was actually helping a lot.\"\n\nChanges see reduced dysregulation, stay length, and parental stress\n\nDr Alison Lally says the hospital has seen less neurodivergent children experiencing dysregulation since the sensory-friendly room's introduction. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nThe Canberra Hospital's new Critical Services Building, which opened last August, included a separate children's emergency area with a sensory-friendly room.\n\nDr Lally said changes have also been made in paediatric procedure and treatment rooms, and some strategies can be applied in the resuscitation area.\n\nShe said since the sensory-friendly room's introduction, the ED has seen a lot less neurodivergent children experiencing dysregulation.\n\n\"We've got some mood lighting [and] beanbags, which might not seem like much but it's a low stimulus [environment],\" Dr Lally said.\n\n\"[That] means there's not much light, there's not much noise, and the colours are quite calming for neurodivergent kids.\n\n\"There's a reduced length of stay, parents aren't feeling so stressed and overwhelmed.\"\n\nAnnabell Fenton (right) says the Canberra Hospital's new sensory-friendly room is a \"game changer\" for Max. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nMs Fenton said for Max the sensory-friendly room has been a \"game changer\".\n\n\"You can close that door and all sound disappears,\" she said.\n\nFor Ms Fenton, the improvement of sensory-friendly spaces in the ED is an important part of helping neurodivergent children learn how to advocate for their accessibility needs to be met.\n\n\"We're teaching young people that, 'This is okay: to ask for the things that I need',\" Ms Fenton said.\n\n\"And they're skills that they'll take through the health system with them, until they're older.\"",

        "text": "Collapsing productivity on Australian farms has left a once world-leading sector at risk of being left behind by international competitors.\n\nAnnual farm productivity today is just a quarter of what it was decades ago, prompting the national farming lobby to ring the alarm for a government-led policy overhaul, including changes to competition and workplace laws.\n\nProductivity measures how efficiently inputs such as feed, fertiliser, fuel, labour, land and water are used to produce outputs like beef, grain, milk or wool.\n\nExecutive director at the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), Jared Greenville, said the rate had fallen around 75 per cent from an annual rate of 2.2 per cent in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n\"Farm productivity has slowed and the average rate's about 0.6 per cent,\" Dr Greenville told Landline.\n\nJared Greenville says increased mechanisation and deregulation supercharged Australian farm productivity before 2000. (ABC Landline)\n\n\"That's put us back in relative terms to international competitors as they're getting stronger productivity growth.\n\n\" They're [just] starting from a lower base than we are. \"\n\nAs the federal government's commodity forecaster, ABARES has estimated the Australian farm sector will produce $91 billion of food, cotton and wool this year.\n\nAustralia has fallen behind its international competitors when it comes to making more from less. (Supplied: ABARES)\n\nIf that eventuated it would be one of the most valuable years for the farm sector, likely further driven by a big winter crop forecast to harvest almost 60 million tonnes.\n\nThe National Farmers' Federation said despite the high forecast it expected the productivity slump would worsen.\n\nNFF president David Jochinke claimed farmers were at the cutting edge of technology and \"clever sustainable practices\" but had been hampered by \"poor policy, administrative burden, and green tape\".\n\nThe NFF used the productivity announcement to again call on the federal government to overturn a ban on live sheep exports, change competition laws, improve access to workers, and restrict transmission lines on farm land.\n\nCall for wider implications to be considered\n\nKatie McRobert from the Australian Farm Institute said innovation typically drove productivity.\n\nThat could include technological advances, increased research spending and improved infrastructure.\n\n\"Often our productivity is held back by a lack of really good infrastructure that can just enable the good flow of goods around a trading system,\" Ms McRobert said.\n\nShe cited a 2017 study that found if farmers had adequate phone and internet access they would contribute an extra $20 billion to the economy.\n\nKatie McRobert says changes to farm policy should consider social and environmental impacts, not just productivity. (ABC Landline)\n\nMs McRobert said policy changes to drive productivity should also consider social, animal welfare and environmental impacts.\n\n\"Maybe a regional community doesn't want to see all the farms in the region consolidate and become one big farm,\" she said.\n\n\"As a society we need to step back a little bit from pure productivity measures and think about what it is we want to incentivise and what the goals are that we're seeking.\"\n\nMechanisation drove productivity before 2000\n\nDr Greenville said Australian farming's high productivity rate before the year 2000 was the envy of not only global competitors, but also other parts of the Australian economy.\n\nIt was driven by increased mechanisation \u2014 such as switching to larger tractors and rotary dairies \u2014 and major changes to trade rules such as deregulation.\n\nSimon Scowen's NSW dairy farm milks 800 cows a day. (ABC Landline)\n\n\"We saw producers shift out of wool production and we saw the sheep flock fall from over 120 million to about 70 million that we see today, and a massive shift of those operations into cropping,\" Dr Greenville said.\n\n\"The cropping industry became more productive as it could grow in terms of the scale of production.\"\n\nAs a mixed farmer from north-east Victoria, the productivity slump prompted a mixed response from fifth-generation farmer James Russell.\n\n\"It does surprise me a little bit as a grain grower. It doesn't surprise me as much as a sheep producer,\" Mr Russell said.\n\nVictorian farmer James Russell says the cost of growing crops and raising sheep means farmers rely on high returns. (ABC Landline)\n\n\"We've seen huge upticks in technology [in] our ability to grow a crop bigger and better.\n\n\"In the sheep industry, we still farm sheep in a very similar way than we did 20 years ago.\n\n\"We don't actually get a return, it costs us money to get sheep shorn [this year].\"\n\nCropping's annual productivity rate is sitting at 1.2 per cent, compared to 0.5 per cent for sheep, which has been plagued by low production and prices.\n\nDairy productivity shows two-speed industry\n\nDespite an annual productivity rate of almost 2 per cent in the 40 years before 2010, dairying's productivity rate has dropped away to basically zero.\n\nBut ABARES said the sector is largely a two-speed industry, with some dairy farmers faring much better than others.\n\nSimon Scowen started farming 30 years ago, milking 80 cows on a farm near Bega. (Supplied)\n\nOne of those driving up the sector's productivity is Simon Scowen, who farms on the New South Wales Mid North Coast.\n\nThis year Mr Scowen has built a large shed for his 800 milking cows.\n\nWith easy access to mixed feed rations, shelter, fans and sprinklers, in the first few months since moving into the shed he said milk production jumped by 20 per cent.\n\n\"Those that have been doing it for a couple of years in Australia, that we've gone and had a look at, they range from a 30 to 40 per cent increase in cow production by putting them in this facility,\" Mr Scowen said.\n\nDairy Australia says seven per cent of the milk produced in Australia comes from cows housed in a shed.\n\nThat figure is expected to increase.\n\nWatch ABC TV's Landline at 12:30pm AEST on Sunday or stream anytime on ABC iview.",

(ABC News: Emma Rennie)\n\nBut instead of paying her retirement income, the former nurse said she was forced back to work.\n\n\"There were so many sleepless nights, waking in the middle of the night thinking there has to be an answer \u2026 what can I do?\" she said.\n\n\"It's quite devastating to think that you've been taken for a ride.\"\n\nLeanne Crumpton says investing in accommodation for people with a disability struck a chord with her after she lost her daughter, who had cerebral palsy. (ABC News: Emma Rennie)\n\nMs Crumpton is one of eight investors with a company called NDISP who have spoken to the ABC about fears they've been ripped off.\n\nThe company, which rejected claims of misconduct and said most investors are happy, managed a $200 million portfolio of more than 140 homes for people with disabilities in Queensland.\n\nAsked about investor complaints, sector watchdog the NDIS Commission said it was \"looking into concerns raised about this provider\".\n\nInvestor says scheme offered potential high rental returns\n\nBack in 2016, the National Disability Insurance Agency, which oversees the NDIS, began encouraging investors to build specialist disability accommodation (SDA), suited for people with disability.\n\nThe modifications include things like hoists to help people take showers, wider doorframes for better accessibility and voice-activated lighting.\n\nIn return, if the homes are tenanted, landlords receive high government-subsidised rent, as much as $50,000 per participant per year according to the NDIA. But it can be a risky investment if the homes are not filled.\n\nLeanne Crumpton's Townsville property was managed by NDIS-approved accommodation provider NDISP. (Supplied: Leanne Crumpton)\n\nUnder government rules, SDA properties must be managed by a NDIS-registered SDA company, providing a conduit between investor landlords and NDIS participants \u2014 with the latter paying rent via their taxpayer-funded plans as well as monthly personal contributions.\n\nIn Ms Crumpton's case, she used her self-managed superannuation fund to buy land and build a three-bedroom SDA house for $600,000 in Townsville in 2021, and signed on NDISP to manage the property.\n\nEmails seen by the ABC show NDISP told Ms Crumpton it \"expected\" the property would get two tenants, and she could receive an annual income of $83,000.\n\nMs Crumpton thought the estimates were best-case scenarios, but that she could count on about half of that.\n\nInstead, the house sat empty for a year and there was no money coming in.\n\nLeanne Crumpton was told she could make $83,000 a year in rent with her SDA home. (ABC News: Emma Rennie)\n\n\"By the middle of the year I was thinking, are these people corrupt or just incompetent? I couldn't quite work it out,\" Ms Crumpton said.\n\n\"It was really difficult to get them on the phone, really difficult to get them to answer emails.\"\n\nShe, like several other investors the ABC has spoken to, has alleged the company did not adequately look for people to tenant the home, but kept sending bills for services including those provided by other companies also controlled by NDISP's owners \u2014 from mowing the lawns to providing electricity.\n\nInvestors have also told the ABC the company was frequently late with rent and often did not respond when landlords tried to find out what was going on with their homes.\n\nAfter a year of no rental income, and outgoings that included more than $4,000 to NDISP-related entities in the first financial year, Ms Crumpton was forced back to work.\n\n\"I couldn't stay retired \u2026 lucky I was a nurse that I could pick up casual work,\" she said.\n\nRetiree Leanne Crumpton, pictured with her grandkids, says she was forced back to work due to her SDA property. (ABC News: Emma Rennie)\n\nBut NDISP has rejected claims anyone was ripped off.\n\nRisks, such as homes going vacant, and inter-company dealings were fully disclosed and most investors were \"completely satisfied\", it told the ABC, adding the sector also faced compliance costs and lumpy cash flows from the NDIA.\n\n\"NDISP was a mission led, profit for purpose company that tried and in many ways succeeded in making the world a better place for people with a disability,\" the company said.\n\nMs Crumpton managed to break her lease with NDISP and sell her property.\n\nBut investors still with NDISP now face further uncertainty.\n\nLast week, the company announced it was shutting down operations after the Australian Tax Office took legal action to wind the company up over debts that in February this year stood at more than $600,000.\n\nNDISP said it would transfer the leases it manages to a new company.\n\nDisability accommodation sector plagued with issues\n\nThe events at NDISP come amid increased scrutiny on the activities of businesses that aim to make money from the multi-billion-dollar NDIS scheme.\n\nThe NDIS Commission has suspended SDA provider Cocoon, which is under investigation by the NDIA over allegations of fraud.\n\nA court has heard the investigation is the largest fraud probe currently on foot at the NDIA.\n\nLast month, the ABC revealed Melbourne businessman Khawaja Haroon was under criminal investigation over allegations of fraud in his NDIS empire.\n\nThe ABC also uncovered evidence of participants being allegedly mistreated. Mr Haroon denies doing anything wrong and says he is cooperating with authorities.\n\nUnlike Cocoon or Mr Khawaja's companies, NDISP only provided housing to NDIS participants and was not responsible for their care.\n\nJessica Walker, head of policy at the Summer Foundation, which advocates for better housing for people with disability, said the SDA sector was also plagued with problems.\n\n\"I think the NDIA could have done a much better job of stewarding the SDA market,\" Ms Walker said.\n\n\"There was a big need [for housing] and people have responded to that without always understanding some of the risks associated with investing.\"\n\nProvider denies any wrongdoing\n\nNDISP is run by former lawyer Darryl Richards and his business partner Jon Johnson.\n\nThe \"head lease\" signed between NDISP and landlords allowed NDISP to manage the properties for up to 20 years.\n\nThree investors the ABC has spoken to have said NDISP would not budge from the agreement when they tried to break leases for their properties.\n\nThe head leases also allow NDISP to use some companies of which Mr Richards and Mr Johnson are shareholders for maintenance, electricity and gardening.\n\nDarryl Richards and Jon Johnson both deny any wrongdoing. (Supplied)\n\nInvestors also paid up to $5,200 each year into a fund purportedly for residents to pay for extra services, until the NDIS Commission told the company to cease the practice, according to court documents.\n\nMr Richards and Mr Johnson deny any wrongdoing.\n\nMr Johnson said NDISP never promised investors they would make particular rental returns and always emphasised risks including that properties might stay empty.\n\nHe said NDISP created related companies \u2014 such as for utilities or services \u2014 out of necessity given stringent compliance obligations.\n\n\"The companies actually made losses,\" he added.\n\nHe said complaints came from a small number of investors and \"reflect a misalignment of expectations, not misconduct\".\n\nHe argued that dissatisfied investors represented four or five homes out of 150 homes.\n\nMr Johnson admitted that \"communication, cash flow, and reporting were affected during periods of high operational strain and technology failure, but [these issues were] never concealed.\"\n\nCouple takes legal action over lease dispute\n\nInvestors Russell and Judy Dunning resorted to pursuing NDISP in court to try and regain control of their four-bedroom SDA property in Cairns.\n\nThe Brisbane couple say they've struggled to understand how they've received so little information about a house they own.\n\n\"From the very beginning there was a distinct lack of communication [and] a lack of answering any questions we had,\" Mr Dunning said.\n\n\" There was an inability to include us in anything, literally anything, to do with the property. \"\n\nThey now know it has two tenants because of the court action they've taken, but say before that they weren't sure because NDISP would not give them details.\n\nJudy and Russell Dunning took legal action after struggling to get information about their own property. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)\n\nThey also allege they have no idea how much money they are entitled to through rent each month.\n\nSome months they've received nothing. Other months it's a few hundred dollars. On a good month, $9,000. The payments weren't accompanied by statements, so they don't know how it's calculated.\n\nThe income is meant to help the financial security of their four kids, two of whom have disabilities.\n\n\"We're always at sea about what's supposed to be coming in, what to expect and when to expect it,\" Ms Dunning said.\n\n\"It leaves you in a serious situation of thinking, 'Well, do we actually own it? Is it actually our property,'\" Mr Dunning said.\n\nThe Dunnings have struggled to understand communication from NDISP. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)\n\nNDISP said it limits the amount of information landlords can see about tenants due to strict privacy provisions under the NDIS, but disputed the Dunnings' claim they weren't told the number of tenants.\n\nNDISP said the NDIS was sometimes late with SDA payments and this impacted when payments could be made to landlords.\n\nWhen the Dunnings tried to get out of their lease, NDISP refused to dissolve the contract, prompting them to spend tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees to take them to the Queensland Magistrates Court.\n\nIn the end, the magistrate dismissed the application, saying the dispute might be heard in a different court.\n\nJon Johnson denies his company owes the Dunnings any money. (Supplied: Jon Johnson)\n\nIn a statement, NDISP's Mr Johnson rejected the Dunnings' allegations they had not received monthly statements or that NDISP owed them money.\n\nHe said the 20-year leases were in place so NDIS participants had certainty about their tenancies, and that NDISP fought the couple in court out of concern for their tenant who they feared would be forced to move out.\n\nMr Dunning says he's happy for the tenants to stay, he just wanted to get rid of NDISP.\n\nAustralian Taxation Office takes NDISP to court\n\nLast week, NDISP got out of the NDIS game after the tax office launched Federal Court action seeking to wind it up over the unpaid tax bill.\n\nIt's been a long-running struggle. Court documents filed by the ATO in a separate matter complain that NDISP was behind on some tax payments even in August 2021.\n\nThe ATO has issued director penalty notices holding both Mr Richards and Mr Johnson personally liable for the tax debts run up by NDISP.\n\nThe amount the ATO is now pursuing NDISP for was not available from the Federal Court. But the company told the ABC a debt was accumulated \"following significant cash flow disruptions\" including more than $1 million owed by the NDIA.\n\nNDISP said it was cooperating with the ATO.\n\n\"This [winding up] action came as a surprise and did not reflect the cooperative tone of previous engagements,\" the company said.\n\nAnother company where Mr Richards was a director, Yellow Card Builders, collapsed in March owing more than $240,000 to the ATO, company documents show.\n\nMr Richards was previously a lawyer who ran his own firm.\n\nHe did not renew his practising certificate in 2021 after a run-in with Queensland's Legal Services Commissioner.\n\nThe commissioner made a finding of unsatisfactory professional conduct for giving the wrong date in an affidavit, and later dropped an investigation involving Mr Richards after he agreed to see a therapist.\n\nIn 2023, when he was no longer a lawyer, Mr Richards nonetheless signed a letter to an NDISP investor in his capacity as \"in-house legal counsel\" of NDISP.\n\n\"I have not practised legal work since not renewing my certificate,\" Mr Richards told the ABC.\n\nInvestors wary as new entity takes over\n\nInvestors worry about what the future holds now that a new company has taken over from NDISP.\n\n\"This new company declares that there's no ties with NDISP, but my feeling is there still is,\" Judy Dunning said.\n\nShe said she was involved in a positive dialogue with new operator Sigma SDA Management, led by chief executive Paul Brunyee.\n\nJudy and Russell Dunning feel unsure about the new company that took over from NDISP. (ABC News: Lucas Hill)\n\nWhile Sigma said it had \"no ties to the former NDISP directors or registration\", its chief operating officer, James Brooker, has managed investment funds that channelled money into NDISP's properties.\n\nMr Brunyee said Mr Brooker's role at the funds \"was confined to investment management with no operational or governance involvement in NDISP\".\n\nSigma has promised its \"next steps\" will include giving investors a briefing as well as producing a \"Q&A resource addressing common concerns from participants, families, SILs and owners\".\n\nMr Brunyee said Sigma had bought leasehold interests from companies owned by Mr Richards and Mr Johnson for a confidential sum.\n\n\"There are no ongoing financial, operational or governance ties to NDISP or its former principals,\" he said.\n\nHe said Sigma will not be taking on NDISP's existing debts because it would \"undermine SIGMA's financial stability and disadvantage both participants and investors\".\n\nCalls for authorities to do better\n\nWhile the NDIS Commission has told the ABC it is looking into NDISP, the Dunnings and Ms Crumpton said nothing ever came of their multiple complaints to authorities.\n\n\"There was a reluctance of \u2026 government agencies to get behind us and back us in the situation against NDISP,\" Mr Dunning said.\n\nThey have called on the NDIA and NDIS commission to do better to help people trying to navigate the SDA sector, which they believe needs better regulation.\n\nThey know other NDISP investors who've been under enormous stress because of the situation \u2014 and are close to the brink.\n\n\"It's had dreadful mental health impacts on all of us,\" Ms Crumpton said.\n\nIn a statement, The NDIS Commission said it will take strong regulatory action where necessary and all SDA providers are subject to regular audits.",

(ABC News: Emma Siossian)\n\nMeanwhile, residents in Port Macquarie rallied to drop supplies by boat to isolated residents in the town's flooded North Shore community, on the northern side of the Hastings River.\n\nNorth Shore residents were without power on Friday, and the car ferries connecting the area were out of action.\n\nDale Jordan and his wife helped buy groceries and deliver them to a local barge doing a supply run on Friday morning.\n\n\"My brother Rodney has been there for 40 years, right on the river,\" he said.\n\n\"They are used to it, but this one is a bit different to the 2021 floods \u2014 the water is staying around for a lot longer.\"\n\nDale Jordan says local oyster farmers and boaters distributed food to North Shore residents. (ABC News: Emma Siossian)\n\nResident rescues\n\nOyster farmers in Coopernook, including Ian Crisp, picked up more than a dozen people across Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\"We've got the gear, we know the lay of the land pretty well. Why not go and help?\" Mr Crisp said.\n\nIan Crisp has experienced a lot of floods but would \"rather forget\" this one. (ABC News: Victoria Pengilley)\n\nChief Superintendent Burnes said it was \"amazing\" to see communities rally together, but encouraged residents to stay safe while assisting others.\n\n\"Spontaneous volunteers are something we need to embrace \u2026 if people can get out there and help communities in that crisis period,\" he said.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nCoopernook Rural Fire Service Captain Sherrie Gaul received phone calls from people isolated and in need of rescue this week.\n\nHer brigade banded together and commandeered an SES boat to rescue 17 people and 10 dogs.\n\nSherrie Gaul and her RFS brigade also performed flood rescues this week.

Not a lot changed.\u201d Against Richmond, Essendon\u2019s better players were around the ball. Nic Martin, voted best afield, combined with Merrett for 72 disposals. Jye Caldwell had 29, the enterprising Archie Roberts 34 and while hard nut Sam Durham had a modest 26, his impact was equal to that of Martin.

Merrett\u2019s Bombers aren\u2019t striving for glory and fame in 2025 so much as desperately seeking improvement. It was this desire to soak up the wisdom of elders that prompted Merrett to converse with \u201ca dozen or two dozen\u201d coaches and champions across the competition.\n\nThis week, he ventured closer to home by organising a meeting with four past Essendon captains. In chronological order: James Hird, Matthew Lloyd, Jobe Watson and Dyson Heppell. It is an initiative that he wants to cement with the current players. \u201cI got a free lunch. So I\u2019ll say thanks Hirdy for that. He\u2019s the big dog, he can pay for lunches. It was incredible. I mean, we\u2019re trying to bridge that connection and the fabric of generations of Essendon players and captains and trying to bring our fans along for the journey as well. Obviously, moving away from Windy Hill 12, 13 years ago. \u201cThose guys are very good with their time as well. So I\u2019m fortunate to have such good people mentoring me ... to me, it\u2019s more about just discussing what they\u2019ve learned. \u201cI\u2019ve been very lucky to meet a dozen or two dozen coaches, Brownlow medallists \u2013 you name it \u2013 across the journey. But it\u2019s hard to go past champions of your own footy club and the fabric they have; to bring Hirdy and Lloyd back into the fold in some way I think should excite fans as well.\u201d\n\nLoading Lloyd, speaking on 3AW on Friday night, said of the meeting: \u201cIt was more that I listened to him around the areas of the club that need to get better. \u201cWhich I don\u2019t want to go into, but I gave him some responses that have worked for me or us in the past that have helped us get to the highest level and how to challenge some of his teammates to drive standards harder. \u201cHe was really honest, which is why I want to be careful of what I say here because we were all there to support him and help him. Merrett wants the current Bombers to form bonds with the past greats he\u2019s cultivated.\n\nLoading \u201cI think internally we\u2019ve moved on from all those scars. But externally, I think there\u2019s a number of people still hurting a little bit. If we can try and bridge that gap as quickly as we can with a bit of urgency, I think those sort of meetings with Hirdy and Lloydy and Jobe of that era hopefully fast track that with that generation. \u201cThere was so much success with the \u201990s and 2000s and \u201980s for me and our players and our current generation of young talent want to immerse themselves with those guys and if I can try and facilitate that as much as possible. \u201cI know Brad\u2019s very open to those guys coming in and being part of our fabric as well.\u201d While disappointed to see Reid injured in the Dreamtime game on Friday night, Merrett said the key defender now knew what he can achieve.",

Credit: Bloomberg \u201cThe EU\u2019s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,\u201d Sefcovic said. \u201cEU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.\u201d Trump has also threatened import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. The tech giant now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major US companies in the White House\u2019s crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs. \u201cI have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cIf that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple to the US\u201d.\n\n\u2018I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering\u2019 Johann Wadephul, German foreign minister The statement by Trump is critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims, as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs on foreign countries over the past several months. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. In response to Trump\u2019s China tariffs, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the US during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $US1200 iPhone would, if made in America, jump in price anywhere from $US1500 to $3500. \u2018This one group in Brussels\u2019 US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump\u2019s postings in a Friday interview on Fox News.\n\nBessent said the EU has a \u201ccollective action problem\u201d because its 27 member states are being represented by \u201cthis one group in Brussels,\u201d such that the \u201cunderlying countries don\u2019t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf\u201d. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants Apple to bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the US. Credit: Bloomberg The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple chief executive this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the US. The core of Trump\u2019s argument against the EU is that America runs a \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export. From the vantage point of the EU\u2019s executive commission, trade with the US is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global centre for finance and technology, the US runs a trade surplus in services with Europe, offsetting some of the trade gap in goods and leaving the imbalance at \u20ac48 billion ($84 billion).\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU\u2019s executive commission has his country\u2019s full support in working to \u201cpreserve our access to the American market\u201d. \u201cI think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,\u201d Wadephul said in Berlin. \u201cSo we are still counting on negotiations and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.\u201d Trump aides have previously said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president\u2019s tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favour with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to \u201ceat\u201d the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to be deploying a similar degree of pressure on Apple.\n\nLoading Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened to impose separate 25 per cent import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes. Until recently, the US president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple pledged in February to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar. \u201cI had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,\u201d Trump told the audience. \u201cI said to him, \u2018My friend, I treated you very good. You\u2019re coming here with $US500 billion, but now I hear you\u2019re building all over India. I don\u2019t want you building in India.\u2019\u201d Analysts have been sceptical that Apple could quickly shift manufacturing to the US, mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories.",

Source: SBS News Neal said many farmers in the area made contingency plans for moving stock to higher ground after major flooding in 2021, but those areas were under water by half a metre this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In 2021, we had a flood that was recognised as one in 100. This year they're saying this is a one-in-500-year flood because all those areas that were normally flood-free are not flood-free anymore,\" Neal said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Cows just got washed away and basically got caught on fences. I've got heaps of photos of stock that has washed up and they're not even local ones, they've come from upriver where obviously people thought they were on flood free paddocks and they just weren't.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to WeatherZone, Oxley Island received 279 millimetres of rain on Tuesday alone, 500 millimetres over three days \u2014 equivalent to eight months\u2019 worth of rain.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeal said they weren\u2019t warned of the severity of the weather event, and modelling didn\u2019t reflect how much rain ultimately came.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe and many more on the island have been isolated for days without power and struggling to tend to their livestock that have survived with feed washed away and equipment destroyed.\n\n\n\nLaura Polson feeding a calf as she stayed with her isolated property during flooding on Oxley Island.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coffee\u2019s steaming hot at the Happy Frog caf\u00e9 in Coffs Harbour in northern NSW.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis cup is one of six billion consumed nationwide each year, according to Agrifutures Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike most, this one is made with locally grown beans.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cafe\u2019s owner is Kim Towner:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat's been a real passion of mine since I first went into the cafe business, was to buy as close to home as I could. And it's just a win-win all round for everybody, I think. It's beautiful coffee. We get to know the people that have grown it. And that has been probably my biggest, favouritest thing. But of course it's got the low food miles, so it's good for the environment. I know its story.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia grows less than half a percent of all the coffee we drink.\n\n\n\n\n\nProducing more sounds a great idea, but is it worth the effort?\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Southern Cross University in Lismore, Professor Tobias Kretzschmar is finding out by trialling new trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo we're part of a larger project with the World Coffee Research. They're interested in trialling 20 to 30 coffee varieties all around the globe. So we piggybacked on that global project to be able to trial those varieties in Australia. And our aim for Australia is to find new varieties that are better suited for this environment and better suited for the mechanized conditions of coffee farming in Australia.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Australian coffee grows in Queensland or northern New South Wales where farmers face climate challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey put their money on a variety that's much too vigorous for this environment. So we're looking at something that's semi-dwarf, easy to be machine harvested. So the next stage would be to take the two to three varieties that we're thinking will out-compete the current varieties and trial them at scale.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, coffee exports spiked recently after a run of falls and prices remained volatile due to trade tensions and fears of economic slowdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Joules is a research analyst with Rabobank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIn April we did see Arabica prices ease slightly but nonetheless on a year-on-year basis we're still around 100% higher.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that means ever-rising prices at the coffee shop. So could Australia ever compete with Brazil or Colombia?\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Tobias Kretzschmar again:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re covering around half a percent of what the Australian consumer is drinking at the moment. If we can double that, that'd be fantastic. If we can triple or quadruple that, we'd be punching above our weight.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also about finding a coffee style with broad appeal. For clues, scientists have turned to a unique taste wheel which helps analyse the makeup of a particular taste.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ben Liu is behind the taste wheel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFirst we actually have this coffee tasting by different professionals. They work in the coffee industry for decades. And then we actually collect a different type of data from them and from description from them. And then we summarise them with also some of the score for the taste and the flavour of the coffee. And then we bring the exact same sample they taste back to our lab and do carry out analysis. And so we can associate the data from the chemistry also to the taste and the smell of the coffee.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe taste wheel doesn\u2019t just identify the flavour of the coffee, but its character as well and uses words as diverse as \u2018yoghurty\u2019, \u2018apple like\u2019 and even dirty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c So this coffee character wheel basically helps the panel members to actually get an idea of what they think, what could be used to describe the taste, the flavour, or a different mouthfeel they actually feel. But saying that there are some bad words there because there are also some bad taste coffee there. Unfortunately, during our coffee research, (we not just taste the best coffee, we also taste bad coffee as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Dr Liu says Australian grown coffee does have some common characteristics:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe collect 100 single-origin coffee around Australian farmers. And when we run this tasting panel, the words that keep coming out for Australian coffee are they are sweet and they are fruity and they are nutty and roasty. So that's the thing that's coming up the most for Australian coffee.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Kim Towner, the decision to use locally grown coffee was simple.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "When a woman knocked on Geoffrey Horlock's door and told him that her baby brother had been buried in the same grave plot as his own brother, he was more than a little surprised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was not sure what to say at first,\" Horlock says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis brother Andrew had been stillborn in 1960. Horlock was around nine at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe recalls his mother telling him about how his brother was taken out of the delivery room in a white sheet and buried in the local cemetery while she was still recovering in hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is how infant loss was often dealt with in the 1960s.\n\n\n\n\"Mum never got over it,\" Horlock says.\n\n\n\nRight until the day she died, she always used to say: 'I wonder which side of the family he looked like.'\n\nThe family was issued a birth certificate and told about the burial site.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this was not always the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Harding family, whose baby died less than three weeks after the Horlocks' in the same regional Western Australian town, no birth certificate was issued.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike baby Horlock, baby Harding was live-born but arrived prematurely and tragically did not survive.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnbeknownst to both families, he was buried alongside baby Horlock in the lower part of his grave plot in August 1960.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until baby Harding\u2019s older sister, Susan Mead, showed up on Geoffrey Horlock's doorstep some 65 years later that the connection was finally made.\n\n\n\nSusan Mead tracked down one of the siblings of Andrew Horlock, whose grave her baby brother shares, to another small town near where she lives. Source: Supplied She had come to ask whether she could place a marking on the grave to recognise her brother.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorlock says once the initial shock passed, he realised there was only one answer.\n\n\n\nFinding Baby Harding\n\nMead lives on a property in the south-west of WA, about 65km east of the small town of Bridgetown where her mother gave birth to baby Harding. Mead and her siblings had spent decades hoping to find their baby brother\u2019s resting place.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut without formal documentation, such as a birth or death certificate, their efforts to find him were continually stymied.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, in March, they reached a turning point.\n\n\n\n\n\nMead's sister-in-law spotted a Facebook post from the Shire of Bridgetown-Greenbushes, about records for the nearby Bridgetown Cemetery having been uploaded to its website.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking over the shire's list of people buried there, Mead came across a mention of a 'Baby Harding'. That name had not been included in previous searchable listings for the cemetery.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt identified the exact location of the grave, too, but when family members went to visit, they found a gravestone for baby Horlock instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfused, the family contacted Bridgetown-Greenbushes Shire, which manages the cemetery. They confirmed that baby Harding is also buried in the plot, which, according to records, had been divided in two \u2014 a practice that the local government has since ceased.\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS News, a spokesperson for the shire acknowledged the challenges with historical burial records for stillbirths and neonatal deaths, noting it is \"currently completing an audit and correlation of hardcopy documents, current headstones and electronic records\" to ensure it has a fully digitised and accurate record of all listings.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson says the shire is aware of one other case in which two unrelated babies were buried in the same plot, dating back to 1954. In that case, two stillborn babies were buried in the same plot eight weeks apart, despite records showing it was not listed as a 'half plot'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Shire is committed to ensuring this information is researched and updated so that descendant family members can search for and locate loved ones,\" the spokesperson says.\n\n\n\nA taboo subject\n\nMany families who lost babies as a result of stillbirth or neonatal death before the 1980s in Australia remain in the dark about their loved one\u2019s final resting place.\n\n\n\n\n\nJoan Noonan is a volunteer co-leader with a group set up by Red Nose Australia, which seeks to prevent the sudden and unexpected death of babies and young children and gives bereavement support for those affected by death of a baby or young child. Its 'Older Loss Group' supports mothers who are still processing the grief of stillbirth years after losing a child.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the key aims of the group, which is based in Victoria, is to help families in tracking down burial sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nNoonan says many families search for the final resting place of their stillborn family members in the hope of finding some peace.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 78-year-old became part of the Older Loss Group about 30 years ago, having lost two infant daughters of her own in the 1970s.\n\n\n\nJoan Noonan, (pictured far right) has helped many women, including Lee (second from left), to find their baby's burial site, years after their loss. Source: Supplied / Red Nose Australia \"In most cases, you weren't given a chance to have a funeral,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The hospital staff would say they were 'looking after these babies', and the hospital would arrange burial and families weren't even told where they were buried.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNoonan says at that time, it was not the \"done thing\" to question the process. Stillbirth was treated as taboo.\n\n\n\nNobody talked about the death of a baby.\n\n\"In the majority of cases, they were buried in communal graves, they often waited for about 10 babies at a time and there's some places in Melbourne where there's hundreds of babies buried in mass graves.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNoonan\u2019s volunteer co-lead, Fotini Koklas, says given most babies they have located via the Older Loss Group are in mass graves, the situation involving the Hardings and the Horlocks appears to be \"extremely rare\".\n\n\n\n\n\nKoklas has come across one similar case in which a baby was buried in a grave with an unrelated adult, with no clear explanation as to why this happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's possible that it was a space issue, or perhaps the cemetery simply didn't know where to place the baby,\" she says.\n\n\n\nCo-leader of Red Nose Australia's Older Loss Group, Fotini Koklas, says while the process of finding a baby\u2019s final resting place should be a healing journey, unnecessary obstacles can make it more emotionally draining than it should be. Source: Supplied\n\nIn search of lost babies\n\nUntil this year, baby Harding's name would have only have been traceable via handwritten records stored in a very specific location by the Bridgetown-Greenbushes shire.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoklas says because of state-based variations in laws, record systems and how stillbirths are handled, it can be incredibly challenging for families to track down accurate information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every cemetery is different, and the level of detail they have in their historical records varies greatly,\" she says.\n\n\n\nHistorically, different stakeholders that may have details that could help families were very siloed from one another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's often a breakdown in communication between cemeteries, stonemasons, and families, in some cases, critical details aren't shared \u2014 either because of incomplete records or administrative oversights.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKoklas says the passage of time complicates the process further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Over the decades, cemetery management has often changed hands, record-keeping systems have evolved, and unfortunately, some older records have been lost, damaged, or simply never kept in the first place \u2014 especially for babies born before the 1980s.\"\n\n\n\nInconsistent records\n\nInaccurate and inconsistent historical records present an added hurdle for those searching for answers.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoklas explains that naming stillborn babies was subject to variation: they could be recorded with their mother's maiden name or married name, or referred to as names such as: \"Baby Smith,\" \"Stillborn Smith,\" or \"Baby of Kate Smith\".\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO \"I found it to be really lonely': Data show parents often silent after miscarriage or stillbirth SBS News 13/10/2023 04:38 Play\n\n\"While families can sometimes search online for burial records, the transition from handwritten paper records to digital systems has introduced a number of issues,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Dates are often misrecorded due to difficulties in reading old handwriting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In one case, a baby who passed away in April 1966 was entered into the system as April 1968.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNoonan says despite such challenges, it's often still possible to piece information together by cross-referencing available records, contacting multiple sources and a bit of compassionate persistence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've developed some records now that show in Victoria what hospitals used what undertakers and then what cemeteries they used and things like that,\" she says.\n\n\n\n'Something to be forgotten'\n\nIn years gone by, a birth may not have even been considered a birth if the baby was stillborn, so no birth or death certificate was issued. This also meant that protocols around burial fell outside of legal requirements.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News The statutory instruments and registration practices related to births and perinatal deaths \u2014 which include stillbirths and neonatal deaths \u2014 have varied between Australian states and territories over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in Queensland and Victoria, legislation around the registration of stillbirths came into place in 1989, while in NSW it was a 1995 Act that recognised stillbirth as a birth and therefore required formal registration.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate professor Fran Boyle from the University of Queensland's Institute for Social Science Research and Stillbirth Centre of Research Excellence says it was not until the mid-1980s that social attitudes toward perinatal deaths began to change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This was largely due to the voices of bereaved parents,\" she explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nParent advocacy groups under the banner of Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society (SANDS) \u2014 now part of Red Nose \u2014 were formed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of their many important achievements was the successful campaign for government to recognise stillborn babies through birth and death certificates,\" Boyle says.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, across Australia, a stillborn baby at 20 weeks gestation or more is required to be registered, in most states and territories that will warrant a birth certificate, noting stillbirth.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Boyle says burial practices tend to reflect the \"prevailing social norm\" of the time, and before the 80s \"the loss of a baby was something to be forgotten\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[It was] not something to be discussed or memorialised.\"\n\n\n\nLiving with the trauma\n\nBoyle says such sentiment informed the practice of withholding stillborn babies from their mothers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany were never given the chance to look at or hold their children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The widely held view was that parents needed to be protected, that seeing their baby, having contact with their baby, creating memories of any kind would be harmful, and intensify and prolong their grief,\" Boyle says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorlock still remembers his mother returning from hospital after giving birth without his baby brother.\n\n\n\nGeoffrey Horlock's recalls how his mother was deeply impacted by not only the loss of her baby, but by the process around the loss in not being able to hold her baby or say goodbye. Source: Supplied He says she spent days sitting by the wood fire stove in their kitchen, just staring at the fire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mum was distressed about it and it troubled her her whole life,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch has changed since laws recognising the births of stillborn babies were strengthened.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe national Care Around Stillbirth and Neonatal Death guidelines, updated in 2024, cover best practice for stillbirth and recommend offering all parents the opportunity to see and hold their baby immediately after birth and allowing them to interact with their baby through activities such as bathing and dressing them.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoklas has seen the benefit of these changes firsthand. As well as being involved in helping to find baby graves, she is a bereaved mum. Her two baby boys died in 2011 and 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am so grateful I got to hold my babies, name them and make funeral arrangements for them,\" she says.\n\n\n\nA healing process\n\nFor those who lost children in decades gone by, the hope of finding their graves remains.\n\n\n\n\n\nKoklas says every family she has supported to locate their baby has shared a similar feeling: a deep sense of peace and closure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Finding a baby's final resting place is one of the most healing and powerful experiences \u2026 it's something that goes beyond words, like a heavy weight being lifted.\n\n\n\nIt doesn't mean they've 'moved on' \u2014 because grief doesn't work that way \u2014 but they feel like they can now live again, just a little bit lighter.\n\nSimilarly, Noonan attests to the importance of finding burial sites. She says while the Older Loss Group has helped to locate hundreds of babies, there are still so many more Australian families out there wishing they knew where their babies were.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe encourages anyone needing help in their search to reach out, saying: \"it's never too late\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australia is running out of space to bury people.

        "text": "Elara was \"caught off guard\" and \"hurt\" when she was denied entry to the women-only gym Fernwood Fitness for not being a \"biologically born female\".\n\n\n\n\n\nA Melbourne-based transgender woman, Elara was drawn to a club owned by the national gym network because her wife and friends had recommended it. She also generally found women's spaces to be more inclusive and accepting of trans women than mixed spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's a lot easier for trans women in women's spaces, fundamentally,\" Elara told SBS News. \"My experience has been that women's spaces are more accepting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when she enquired via text message about whether she would be permitted access as a transgender woman, she was told by a manager at Fernwood Fitness in Melbourne that \"the Fernwood company policy is not inclusive of transgender women\".\n\n\n\nElara received a message from a manager at a Melbourne Fernwood Fitness gym, who said only \"biologically born females who identify as female\" could join the women-only gym. Source: Supplied Fernwood Fitness is one of the leading women-only gym chains in Australia. They have over 70 clubs across Australia and over 90,000 members.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fernwood offers membership only to biologically born females who identify as female,\" the message, which has been verified by SBS News, read.\n\n\n\n\n\nElara later shared her experience on Reddit, prompting an outpouring of support \u2014 and several anonymous accounts from other transgender women who claim they too were turned away by Fernwood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I found this out last year when I tried to join,\" one user wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the text exchange, Elara said she was phoned by the national CEO of Fernwood, which the company has confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was just flabbergasted,\" Elara said. \"My experience of being a trans woman so far in Melbourne has been that the level of vitriol and pushback and rejection that we expect from watching the news isn't there.\"\n\n\n\n\"I guess I got a little bit forgetful that the world is still like that,\" Elara said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It really took me aback and made me think about all the rights that we think we have here ... to just find out that some people can be like, 'nah,' that company policy is to just say no.\"\n\n\n\nIs it legal to exclude trans women from women-only spaces?\n\nThe federal Sex Discrimination Act 1984 makes it unlawful to treat someone unfairly because of their sex, sexual orientation, intersex status, or gender identity.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), gender identity includes \"the way people express or present their gender and recognises that a person's gender may be an identity other than male or female\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Terms commonly used to describe a person's gender identity include trans, transgender and gender diverse,' AHRC's website reads. \"It does not matter what sex a person was assigned at birth or whether the person has undergone any medical intervention.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Paula Gerber, an expert in human rights law at Monash University, said while women-only gyms are lawful both in Victoria and nationwide, excluding trans women is not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fernwood is perfectly entitled to have a women-only gym,\" she told SBS News. \"But women include trans women in Australia.\"\n\n\n\nPaula Gerber, a professor in human rights law at Monash University, said that while women-only gyms are lawful in Australia, excluding trans women from them is not. Source: Getty / Kazuma Seki \"It is not lawful to have a women's only venue and say that's only for people who were described as female on their birth certificate,\" Gerber said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The law says trans women are women.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery Australian state and territory has its own anti-discrimination laws that operate alongside federal legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Victoria, where Elara lives, it's against the law to discriminate against people based on gender identity \"that may or may not be the same as the sex you were designated with at birth\", under the Equal Opportunity Act 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut organisations are permitted to apply for temporary exemptions to the Act, which allows discrimination of any protected characteristics \u2014 which include gender identity \u2014 to be lawful, provided it would help the Act's goal of promoting equal opportunity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For example, some clubs may provide benefits for members of particular age groups or single sex,\" according to the Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission's website.\n\n\n\nFernwood is perfectly entitled to have a women-only gym. But women include trans women in Australia. Paula Gerber, human rights law expert\n\nIn 2021, Fernwood sought an exemption from Queensland's Anti-Discrimination Act 1991, concerned about members' religious freedom and psychological safety, as well as fears that their women-only fitness model \"could give rise to a complaint by a man that Fernwood is directly discriminating against men\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commission granted the exemption for five years, saying female-only fitness clubs were a \"welfare\" and \"equal opportunity\" measure.\n\n\n\nIt's unclear on what grounds Fernwood Fitness is excluding trans women, but at present, their publicly available 11-page membership terms and conditions do not reference sex or gender eligibility criteria.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, they operate under a franchise model, making it difficult to ascertain how widespread their policy is.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News has contacted Fernwood for clarification on this issue but has not received a response.\n\n\n\nFernwood defends policy as necessary for 'emotional and physical safety'\n\nIn a statement provided to both SBS News and Elara, Fernwood Fitness said they had \"a responsibility to consider the needs of its broader member community\", adding that female-only spaces \"based on sex\" were necessary to protect members' \"emotional and physical safety\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fernwood Fitness proactively reached out to Elara to acknowledge her as an individual and to talk about her experience,\" the statement provided to SBS News read.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Government announces federal review into gender-affirming healthcare for young people\n\n\"This outreach was made with genuine care, recognising the personal nature of her enquiry,\" the statement read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Fernwood appreciates the courage it can take to enquire about a membership as a transgender woman and acknowledges that the experience may have been hurtful or disappointing. Fernwood Fitness extends its sincere empathy in response.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At the same time, Fernwood Fitness has a responsibility to consider the needs of its broader member community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A significant number of Fernwood Fitness members come from backgrounds where experiences of domestic violence, sexual assault, cultural beliefs, or religious practices necessitate access to female-only spaces based on sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For many of these women, such spaces are not a preference but a requirement for their emotional and physical safety and for accessing the health and fitness services they need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is not a reflection on personal identity, but rather a commitment to maintaining the integrity of a space that many women rely on. Fernwood is currently reviewing all relevant legal requirements.\"\n\n\n\n'Trans women are women', legal expert says\n\nGerber said these arguments may not hold legal weight when used to exclude trans women.\n\n\n\nPaula Gerber, a professor of human rights law at Monash University, said Fernwood's argument may not hold legal weight when used to exclude transgender women. Credit: Paula Gerber \"Women include trans women in Australia \u2014 that's very clear from the decision in Tickle and Giggle and the Lesbian Action Group,\" Gerber said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTickle v Giggle was a case centred on transgender woman Roxanne Tickle being denied access to a women-only app, Giggle for Girls. The Federal Court found the app had indirectly discriminated against Tickle based on her gender identity, a breach of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Court ruled: \"The acceptance that Ms Tickle is correctly described as a woman, reinforcing her gender identity status for the purposes of this proceeding, and therefore for the purposes of bringing her present claim of gender identity discrimination, is legally unimpeachable.\"\n\n\n\nSupporters of Roxanne Tickle hold a sign outside the Federal Court of Australia in April 2024. TERF stands for 'trans-exclusionary radical feminist'.

The threat is from men.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said these cases may influence what the law says about Fernwood's exclusion of trans women: \"That's contrary to what the law says \u2014 the law says trans women are women.\"\n\n\n\nTrans safety in women's spaces\n\nElara said one of the most upsetting parts of the conversation was the implication that she, as a trans woman, might pose a safety threat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People who are saying that we need to exclude trans women for safety aren't really talking about women's safety. They're talking about an ideological position about whether or not trans women are women,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson from Zoe Belle Gender Collective (ZBGC), a trans and gender diverse-led advocacy organisation based in Victoria, told SBS News: \"Trans women and cis women have much in common, including being disproportionately impacted by men's violence.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The same drivers of violence that impact cis women equally drive violence against trans women, including rigid gender norms and dominant forms of masculinity,\" a ZBGC spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nA La Trobe University study found transgender and non-binary people were more likely to experience high psychological distress than cisgender people. Source: SBS News Trans women, trans men and non-binary people were also more likely to experience very high psychological distress compared to cisgender women and men, according to La Trobe University's Private Lives 3 report from 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2023 survey of 3,099 transgender people conducted by the Trans Justice Project and the Victorian Pride Lobby found one in two participants had experienced anti-trans hate. One in ten had experienced anti-trans violence, and nine in ten had witnessed online anti-trans abuse.\n\n\n\nTrans women and cis women have much in common, including being disproportionately impacted by men's violence. Spokesperson, Zoe Belle Gender Collective\n\nInternationally, a 2021 study by the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law found transgender people were over four times more likely to experience violent victimisation than cisgender people, or those whose gender identity corresponds with the sex assigned to them at birth. This included higher rates of violence than both cisgender men and women.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, analysis by the Australian Bureau of Statistics found 97 per cent of all sexual assault offenders were male, according to data recorded by police agencies in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When incidents of trans exclusion occur, it can reinforce the ideas that we don't belong, that we are not worthy of support, or that the violence perpetuated against our community does not matter,\" a ZBGC spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These incidents may also contribute to some trans women feeling unsafe to access the services our society has created to support victims of violence.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO 'A really dark place': Chantel is among LGBTIQ+ users fearful of Meta's changes SBS News 22/02/2025 06:45 Play\n\n'Trans women are not a threat'\n\nGerber also warned policies excluding trans women can lead to harmful \"policing\" of women's bodies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The privacy that's being violated is trans women having to prove their gender,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're seeing situations where complete strangers feel entitled to challenge someone's right to be in a space, based solely on how they look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is what we need to avoid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If somebody says they\u2019re a woman, then they are a woman.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also questioned traditional narratives that trans women were threats to women's safety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Men pretending to be women so that they can get into a women's only gym and assault someone \u2026 that's not what trans women are doing,\" Gerber said. \"Trans women are just trying to be themselves and live their authentic life.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nA celebration of strength and resilience, aimed to foster understanding and respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery year, from 27 May to 3 June, Australians are presented with the opportunity to learn more about the nation\u2019s shared histories, cultures and achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese dates commemorate two significant milestones in the reconciliation journey and the nation's history.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Paul Janke is NITV's National Indigenous Affairs Editor and host of NITV's flagship program, The Point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of course is the successful 1967 referendum, which for the first time included voted to include Aboriginal people within our senses. And the second one is the High Courts Mabo decision on June the third, which ended the legal fiction of Terra Nullius that when the British arrived here, that this land belonged to no one. So there two key dates that mark Reconciliation Week, and I encourage as many people as I know and everyone who's listening to learn more about those two dates.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNational Reconciliation Week started as the Week of Prayer for Reconciliation in 1993 - which also happens to be the International Year of the World\u2019s Indigenous Peoples.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was supported by Australia\u2019s major faith communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1996, the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation launched Australia\u2019s first National Reconciliation Week.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2001, Reconciliation Australia was established to continue to provide national leadership on reconciliation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same year, approximately 300,000 people walked across Sydney Harbour Bridge as part of National Reconciliation Week - and subsequently across bridges in cities and towns - to show their support for reconciliation.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, National Reconciliation Week is celebrated in workplaces, schools and early learning services, community organisations and groups, and by individuals Australia-wide.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Jackie Huggins is a prominent historian, academic and Bidjara and Birri Gubba woman with the University of Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer mother Auntie Rita Huggins was a key campaigner in the 1967 referendum, of which the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people received an overwhelming vote of over 90 per cent from the Australian public in favor of being included in the census.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"National Reconciliation Week is always a week to really feel excited about, but at the same time we know that there's a long way to go. While we see all these very positive things happening in our communities, there's still a lot of negatives that we have to fight against and we have to be vigilant of to get justice for our people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Huggins says the dial hasn't moved in terms of closing the gap, and is taking a very, very long time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It will take hundreds of years to reach any kind of parity with non-Indigenous Australians across all those levels. There's been here in Queensland, the tried treaty and truth telling programs that we've had and they've been dismissed by governments.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she says First Nations people are still making sure that they continue their long overdue and hard fought justice programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There hasn't been a let up in children going into care, foster homes or other care. It also, particularly around criminal justice system and with our young folk in jail. So there's a continuum of what needs to be done - housing, education, employment, the usual things that plague Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's lifestyle.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the theme this year Bridging Now to Next is very significant because it's the 25th anniversary of the bridge walk around Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Here in Brisbane it was about 80,000 people that walked and people who've walked in localised their localised areas for reconciliation. So that's been massive support for us. Right now we have a lot of young people who still have fire in their belly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Huggins says they want to see big changes come within their own lifetime as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For those of us have been in a struggle for a long time over decades. For me it's 45 years. We do want to hand over the baton and make sure young people step up to become the next because we have long endured massive changes. But also with that we've had some good political gain, but not nearly enough to close any gap in our country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, the Australian National Maritime Museum will mark Reconciliation Week 2025 with an installation of the 12 turtle shells hand-painted by Torres Strait artist Gail Mabo around the deck of the Endeavour.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn June 11th, 1770, Lieutenant James Cook's ship, the Endeavour, ran aground on a coral reef in Far North Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt happened in a part of the Sea Country that the Guugu Yimithirr people have ancestral kinship responsibility to oversee. The reef is also a part of the traditional Sea Country of several Eastern Yalanji Aboriginal clans ((including the Wyamburr, Yuki Baja-Muliku, Kuku Bididji, Kuku Yalanji, and Kuku Nyungkul)).\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Poll is the Manager of Indigenous Programs at the museum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They ended up spending about six weeks there, and there was all these different sorts of interactions that happened. But one of the most significant that Cook and Banks and the other people in the Endeavour talk about is when some people from the Guugu Yimithirr people came onto the boat one day and when they looked around the boat, they were horrified because they saw that there was all these turtles, full size turtles, which had been taken at the wrong time of the year and taken from a sacred breeding ground for turtles.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the Indigenous group saw this as a huge transgression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's literally like walking into a supermarket, not paying for anything. So they were confronted by the local community for breaking the law and that was the catalyst for this, a series of events which happened when they went ashore next time Cook and his men, the Guugu Yimithirr people, they burnt some ground and Cook fired at one of the local people as well in that incident.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs someone who prioritises contemporary First Nations voices across collections and exhibitions, Mr Poll is really proud to be able to have an installation from Gail Mabo - the daughter of land rights activist Eddie Mabo.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says they have virtual excursions available for school students who can't make it in person.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"On Monday, we have our virtual excursions for school students. Any school student around the state can dial in. You can find about this on our webpage. And we're doing a big presentation. Usually we get several hundred students and this virtual excursion will be about the history of Reconciliation week in Australia and practical stories of reconciliation around the country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey will also have a rooftop projection as part of the Vivid Festival.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn Paul Janke says the history of National Reconciliation Week goes back to the early 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Around 1991, there was a Royal Commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. And one of the recommendations was that from that was that there needs to be a sort of reconciliation to address Indigenous advantage in Australia. So from that recommendation came a 10 year process working towards reconciliation, working towards repairing the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people of this country, move now ahead to 2025, and that idea of reconciliation and really finishing the unfinished business.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says they hoped that they would achieve reconciliation by 2001, which was the centenary of Federation here in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's taken a bit longer, but that theme is still current, that they're looking for a united Australia that respects this land for everyone, but also values Aboriginal and Torres Strait heritage and history and people as part of the Australian nation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says this year's theme really builds on a keystone anniversary for the reconciliation movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's 25 years since the famous Sydney Harbour Bridge Walk for Reconciliation. 2000 was a pinnacle year for that 10 year process from 1991 to really build a people's momentum towards reconciliation. And that colonised in a walk of over 250,000 people across Sydney Harbour Bridge and really highlighted that people had prioritised the need for reconciliation in this country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe believes this year's National Reconciliation Week wants to build on that momentum, to recapture that spirit of the people's movement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Post the 2023 referendum, the voice referendum, people are saying, look, we need reconciliation more than ever and we need to actually finish what we call the unfinished business of this country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Huggins' calls for non-Indigenous people to join the push for change.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarvation and desperation is gripping the Gaza Strip.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinian health minister Majed Abu Ramadan says children and elderly have been the most affected by the severe deprivation of food aid in recent days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have info that more than 29 young children, infants and elderly lost their lives because of starvation-related issues.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations says a quarter of Gaza's 2.3 million people are currently at risk of famine.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter an 11-week total blockade, Israel has finally allowed some aid deliveries to resume into the desperate region.\n\n\n\n\n\nUN spokesman Stephane Dujarric says about 90 trucks have now delivered critical humanitarian aid to multiple destinations within Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYesterday about 90 loaded trucks left the Kerem Shalom crossing to multiple destinations inside Gaza. They carried nutrition supplies, flour, medicines and other critical stocks that were allowed in. They continue to face huge challenges in getting goods out of the crossings to where they are needed in Gaza. The shipment from yesterday is limited in quantity and nowhere near sufficient to meet the scale and scope of Gaza's 2.1 million people. Other supplies such as fresh food, hygiene items, water purification agents and fuel to power hospitals have not been let in for 80 days.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFlour and other aid began reaching some of Gaza's most vulnerable areas, with Palestinians in the southern city of Khan Younis, including children, scrambling to gather supplies that were being distributed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, for the first time in over a month, the Bana bakery in Gaza's central city of Deir al-Balah has opened its doors after the UN's World Food Program was able to bring in flour to bake flatbread, a local staple.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Program's Vladimir Jovcev says the supplies are insufficient but he hopes the borders can stay open and more food can flow in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Symbolically you know, the smell of fresh bread is the smell of hope. So we hope that you know, the borders remain open, the crossings remain open and then we\u2019re able to bring more humanitarian aid to assist everyone in here. The bread produced in this bakery will not be sold at the moment on the counters in the bakeries. It is going to be distributed through our existing network of partners, mainly the ones operating the hot meals kitchen, and given to the ones that are mostly in need.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as aid trickles in, a new, intensified Israeli ground offensive into Gaza has begun with local health authorities saying more than 500 Palestinians have been killed in the past week.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his military intends to seize all of the Gaza Strip, destroy Hamas, free Israeli hostages and displace the Palestinian population.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Fletcher, the UN's humanitarian chief, has issued a dire warning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The scaffolding built last century to protect us from inhumanity is crumbling. Those who will die as a result need us to act. Some parties to conflict have committed flagrant violations of the rules of law. Some have justified immense civilian harm through permissive interpretations of the law, loosely defining who is a lawful target, what constitutes a military objective, or what level of civilian harm is proportional.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe comments come two days after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with the leaders of France and Canada, demanded a ceasefire and an end to the Israeli blockade.\n\n\n\n",

There are a number that are still missing as well, and that search continues. And our thoughts are for those communities out there that have been affected by this major and significant weather event. It's going to take some time. As we know, Australians and New South Wales people are resilient, we will get through this, and we will be there to support you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese is travelling to flood-affected areas today.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal MPs have expressed broad support for reuniting with the Nationals, though concerns linger over the latter\u2019s policy demands.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth parties have delayed announcing their shadow cabinet line-ups as talks continue.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a virtual party room meeting last night, Liberal leader Sussan Ley said there was strong backing to remain in coalition, but not at any cost.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nationals are pushing for commitments to nuclear energy, divestiture laws, a regional investment fund, and improved phone coverage.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne Liberal source says that none of the proposals were deal breakers, but M-Ps remain cautious about unclear costings and the risk of signing what they call, a blank cheque.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael has allowed limited aid into Gaza for the first time in weeks, but shortages remain severe.\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinian officials say just 100 trucks carrying food and medical supplies entered on Wednesday local time, far below what's needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome southern bakeries have reopened using U-N-supplied flour, but many trucks remain stuck at the border.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent fears crowds may loot incoming aid.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahu says a new distribution zone will soon allow U-S companies to deliver food safely in military-controlled areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ultimately, we intend to have large safe zones in the south of Gaza. The Palestinian population will move there for their own safety, while we conduct combat in other zones, and receive humanitarian aid there without Hamas interference. In the meantime, we authorised letting trucks enter Gaza to provide for immediate needs. Yesterday, I think 100, more than 100 trucks went in. More will come in today.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael imposed the blockade in March, accusing Hamas of diverting aid, claims Hamas denies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN says a quarter of Gaza\u2019s population faces famine.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to health officials, at least 29 people, including children, have died from starvation in recent days.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials are working to understand how the ban on international student enrolments at Harvard University will impact Australians studying there.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration revoked the university's ability to enrol international students and is forcing existing students to transfer to other schools or lose their legal status.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Ambassador to the United States Kevin Rudd posted on X [[former Twitter]] that the Embassy is working to obtain further details from the U-S government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are monitoring closely developments at Harvard University in relation to the administration\u2019s statement this afternoon on the future enrolment of international students. I know this will be distressing for Harvard\u2019s many Australian students. The Embassy is working with the United States Government to obtain the details of this decision so that Australian students can receive appropriate advice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Rudd adds that he intends to engage with the U-S administration on the impact this decision will have on Australian students and their families both at Harvard and at other campuses across the United States.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a University of Queensland study, Australians are swearing less online than expected, ranking below the U-S and UK in global profanity use.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers analysed over 1.7 billion words from online content across 20 English-speaking countries, tracking 597 vulgar words using computational linguistics.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite Australia\u2019s reputation for colourful language, lead researcher Martin Schweinberger suggests Aussies may reserve swearing for in-person conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe notes many might find the findings surprising, as profanity and slang are often embraced as part of Australian culture, even in tourism slogans like \u201cso where the bloody hell are you?\u201d asked by model Lara Bingle.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nTo tennis, and Alex de Minaur faces a challenging first week at the French Open, with a potential quarter-final clash against rival Jannik Sinner looming, if he can get that far.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe draw has offered little relief for Australia\u2019s 15-strong contingent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the women\u2019s bracket, Maya Joint and Ajla Tomljanovic will meet in a first-round clash dubbed a 'battle of the generations'.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes just days after the two face off in the Morocco Open semi-final on Friday, Joint's first W-T-A semi-final and Tomljanovic\u2019s 10th French Open campaign.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "An in-principle agreement to four key policies has paved the way for the Coalition to reunite after their recent split.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberal party room met virtually on Friday, ticking off the demands the Nationals had made before breaking up their political arrangement for the first time in nearly 40 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe policies were removing a federal moratorium on nuclear energy, boosting rural phone connectivity, divestiture powers to keep big supermarkets in check and keeping a regional investment fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been reservations about the policies, including from Liberal free-marketeers who argue divestiture powers represent too much government intervention.\n\n\n\nPolicy details will still be the subject of negotiations given the Liberals only agreed to in-principle support.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a broad consensus a united Opposition was more important than infighting, despite anger at how the Nationals acted when they announced their exit from the Coalition on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regional party insists it was a policy-driven split and not a power play.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No matter how they want to dress it up, when our people in the regions are suffering way more than the people in the cities, a few polices that would help them being left on the table isn't a big ask,\" Nationals senator Ross Cadell told the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n'Tongue in cheek'\n\nLiberal leader Sussan Ley and Nationals leader David Littleproud will now need to bury the hatchet to form a shadow cabinet, which is made up on a proportional basis of MPs from both sides.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe portfolio division is negotiated by the leaders, who then choose their respective representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiner details of a coalition agreement will also need to be hammered out.\n\n\n\n\n\nLittleproud's handling of the saga has led to rumblings about his leadership, but Nationals sources insist only a small cabal is agitating against him.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked if he believed Littleproud's future as leader would be tenable if the Coalition reunited, Nationals MP Michael McCormack \u2014 who led the party from 2018 to 2021 \u2014 told ABC Canberra on Friday morning: \"That would be up to the party room.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd when questioned if Littleproud would have his full support, McCormack said: \"I'm ambitious for him.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the same comment former prime minister Scott Morrison used before he replaced Malcolm Turnbull as Liberal leader in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater, McCormack sought to cast it as a \"tongue in cheek\" remark in an interview with SBS News, saying he supported Littlepround but reiterated that his tenure would be up to the party room.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe didn\u2019t rule out a future leadership tilt, altough added that both he and the majority of the party room supported the Nationals leader \"at the moment\".\n\n\n\nNationals MP Michael McCormack (left) and David Littleproud.

But it\u2019s hard to go past champions of your own footy club and the fabric they have; to bring Hirdy and Lloyd back into the fold in some way I think should excite fans as well.\u201d\n\nLoading Lloyd, speaking on 3AW on Friday night, said of the meeting: \u201cIt was more that I listened to him around the areas of the club that need to get better. \u201cWhich I don\u2019t want to go into, but I gave him some responses that have worked for me or us in the past that have helped us get to the highest level and how to challenge some of his teammates to drive standards harder. \u201cHe was really honest, which is why I want to be careful of what I say here because we were all there to support him and help him. Merrett wants the current Bombers to form bonds with the past greats he\u2019s cultivated.\n\nLoading \u201cI think internally we\u2019ve moved on from all those scars. But externally, I think there\u2019s a number of people still hurting a little bit. If we can try and bridge that gap as quickly as we can with a bit of urgency, I think those sort of meetings with Hirdy and Lloydy and Jobe of that era hopefully fast track that with that generation. \u201cThere was so much success with the \u201990s and 2000s and \u201980s for me and our players and our current generation of young talent want to immerse themselves with those guys and if I can try and facilitate that as much as possible. \u201cI know Brad\u2019s very open to those guys coming in and being part of our fabric as well.\u201d While disappointed to see Reid injured in the Dreamtime game on Friday night, Merrett said the key defender now knew what he can achieve.",

Credit: Bloomberg \u201cThe EU\u2019s fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both,\u201d Sefcovic said. \u201cEU-US trade is unmatched & must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.\u201d Trump has also threatened import taxes against Apple for its plans to continue making its iPhone in Asia. The tech giant now joins Amazon, Walmart and other major US companies in the White House\u2019s crosshairs as they try to respond to the uncertainty and inflationary pressures unleashed by his tariffs. \u201cI have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cIf that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple to the US\u201d.\n\n\u2018I think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering\u2019 Johann Wadephul, German foreign minister The statement by Trump is critical in that he suggests the company itself would bear the price of tariffs, contradicting his earlier claims, as he rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs on foreign countries over the past several months. In general, importers pay the tariffs and the costs are often passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. In response to Trump\u2019s China tariffs, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook said earlier this month that most iPhones sold in the US during the current fiscal quarter would come from India, with iPads and other devices being imported from Vietnam. After Trump rolled out tariffs in April, bank analysts estimated that a $US1200 iPhone would, if made in America, jump in price anywhere from $US1500 to $3500. \u2018This one group in Brussels\u2019 US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent tried to provide some clarity on Trump\u2019s postings in a Friday interview on Fox News.\n\nBessent said the EU has a \u201ccollective action problem\u201d because its 27 member states are being represented by \u201cthis one group in Brussels,\u201d such that the \u201cunderlying countries don\u2019t even know what the EU is negotiating on their behalf\u201d. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wants Apple to bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the US. Credit: Bloomberg The Treasury secretary said he was not in a White House meeting this week that Cook attended, but he also spoke with the Apple chief executive this week. Bessent said the goal was to have Apple bring more of its computer chip supply chain into the US. The core of Trump\u2019s argument against the EU is that America runs a \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d trade deficit with the 27 member states. Countries run trade deficits when they import more goods than they export. From the vantage point of the EU\u2019s executive commission, trade with the US is roughly in balance if both goods and services are included. As a global centre for finance and technology, the US runs a trade surplus in services with Europe, offsetting some of the trade gap in goods and leaving the imbalance at \u20ac48 billion ($84 billion).\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the EU\u2019s executive commission has his country\u2019s full support in working to \u201cpreserve our access to the American market\u201d. \u201cI think such tariffs help no one, but would just lead to economic development in both markets suffering,\u201d Wadephul said in Berlin. \u201cSo we are still counting on negotiations and support the European Commission in defending Europe and the European market while at the same time working on persuasion in America.\u201d Trump aides have previously said the goal of his tariffs was to isolate China and strike new agreements with allies, but the president\u2019s tariff threats undermine the logic of those claims. Trump has run hot and cold on his relationship with Apple, a sign that currying favour with him might not necessarily shield a company from his anger. He has essentially told companies such as Walmart to \u201ceat\u201d the costs of his tariffs instead of raising prices, even though doing so could squeeze profits and cause layoffs. He now appears to be deploying a similar degree of pressure on Apple.\n\nLoading Trump had previously created an exemption on electronics imported from China to help companies such as Apple, something he could now remove. He also threatened to impose separate 25 per cent import taxes on computer chips and could have the tariffs schedule rewritten in ways that could expose Apple products to the taxes. Until recently, the US president repeatedly bragged about the $500 billion that Apple pledged in February to invest domestically as part of its development of artificial intelligence technologies. But he publicly turned against the company last week while speaking in Qatar. \u201cI had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,\u201d Trump told the audience. \u201cI said to him, \u2018My friend, I treated you very good. You\u2019re coming here with $US500 billion, but now I hear you\u2019re building all over India. I don\u2019t want you building in India.\u2019\u201d Analysts have been sceptical that Apple could quickly shift manufacturing to the US, mainly because it has spent decades embedding complex supply chains in China to feed the factories.",

        "text": "The current system of incentivising Aussie to buy oversized cars instead of making them pay more has been described as an \"outrage\". Should it change?\n\nAussies are shifting to larger cars, but there's one reason that should end, critics argue. Source: Reddit/Facebook\n\nThere are growing calls for Australian state governments to rethink their approach to how much drivers pay to use the roads and for the federal government to end a perverse incentive pushing Aussies to embrace oversized utes and trucks. As bigger and bigger cars proliferate on our roads, the massively accelerating trend is costing taxpayers, worsening congestion and polluting the environment, critics say.\n\nThe luxury car tax means Aussies who are buying a car worth more than $80,576 (this financial year) will pay an extra tax on the cost of the vehicle above that amount. However a loopholes means most utes and SUVs are exempt because they are classified as light commercial vehicles regardless of whether they are bought for private or commercial use.\n\nAssociate Professor Milad Haghani, an expert in urban resilience at the University of Melbourne, is among those who continue to question why the exemption is still in place.\n\n\"The luxury car tax exception has been one of the biggest incentives for people to go big and buy big cars,\" he told Yahoo News Australia.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Because if somebody is looking at a price range of $80,000 and above, there's really an incentive to buy a pick-up truck or big car because then they get exempted from the whopping 30 per cent luxury tax and it becomes quite attractive to the buyer.\n\n\"And a lot of the buyers don't use it for commercial purposes,\" he added.\n\nThe status quo means every tax payer is \"effectively subsidising\" the purchase of such mega utes Prof Haghani said. The Australian Institute recently calculated that comes at a cost of about $250 million a year.\n\nAnd that's before other externalities that impose a cost on society are considered with research showing the larger vehicles have an outsized impact on worsening congestion, polluting the environment and degrading our roads.\n\nSome imported vehicles have become seriously large. Source: Facebook\n\nAccording to Prof Haghani, a large ute that is twice the size of a smaller car will have 16 times the impact when it comes to road damage. That's because of something called the fourth powered law \"which is a very known thing in pavement engineering that says the amount of damage is proportional to the fourth power of its axle weight. So if the axle weight is doubled, the impact is 16 times bigger.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLess than 25 years ago, Australian buyers overwhelmingly bought small passenger vehicles like sedans and hatchbacks. But according to Prof Haghani, their percentage of new sales has plummeted in recent years, now making up just 17 per cent of new car sales. Instead, 80 per cent of cars bought in Australia are either an SUV, ute, van or light truck.\n\nWhile Aussie consumers appear to be embracing them, certain local politicians, like city councillors in Melbourne, have been pushing back against their adoption. Last year the Yarra City Council unanimously voted to investigate the potential to raise parking fees for large vehicles \u2014 following a policy adopted in Paris which has seen larger SUVs slugged a $30 per hour rate to park in the inner city.\n\nGreens Councillor Sophie Wade who led the push told Yahoo News the city's streets simply \"weren't designed for this kind of vehicle.\" Such a reality is clearly evidenced by the fact Standards Australia has been mulling whether to increase the size of standard carpark spaces due to the trend.\n\nShould bigger cars pay more for rego?\n\nProf Haghani would also like to see state registrations overhauled to put emphasise on the size of the vehicle and make the owners of American style large utes and trucks pay more.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCurrently, only NSW and WA consider the weight of the vehicle when charing for registration. Queensland and Tasmania use the number of engine cylinders, which is a proxy while Victoria set fees based on location.\n\n\"What would a truly equitable registration fee model look like? Based on the evidence, it would not only account for vehicle size and weight, but also how often the vehicle is driven,\" he wrote this week in The Conversation.\n\nAs it stands in most jurisdictions, \"the registration fee system is just not a fair and equitable one,\" he told Yahoo.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

Source: TikTok/proj3ct_lift\n\nA tradie and his mates have gone viral online for making a boat out of a picnic table, large olive oil drums and an esky to go cruising in on the weekend.\n\nKurt, 34, who opted to only tell Yahoo News his first name, said the idea started as a joke until one of his friends bought heaps of olive oil barrels on Facebook Marketplace, informing the group they really ought to make their dream a reality.\n\n\"We thought, alright, we're going to have to do it then... it only took us about five hours in the end,\" the mechanic told Yahoo. \"It's basically a picnic table fastened to the olive barrels \u2014 they're used as floats... we made sure to make the backend quite strong to hold all the weight and clamped on the small engine.\"\n\nFootage of the \"picnic boat\" in action shows Kurt and five mates heading down the Swan River in Perth before cruising along the coast once they hit the ocean.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We had lifejackets strapped underneath to the 'boat'... and it did have an esky built in it. Carlton Drys were pretty popular so it was an all-round decision to enjoy a few.\"\n\n\"There were plenty of memorable moments, as you can imagine it's not every day you see a bunch of lads floating down the river on a picnic table. Plenty of people on the water got a good laugh,\" he said.\n\nTradie continues to make whacky inventions inspired by 'boat'\n\nThe group of mates enjoyed the \"picnic boat\" on several occasions but Kurt admitted it's now \"pretty destroyed\" and the vessel has been retired for years. The footage was captured over six years ago, with Kurt only deciding to share it online now he's started to build other whacky inventions, explaining the 'boat' sparked his imagination.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe recently made a \"gas powered hot water dog wash on wheels\" as well as other practical guides to help Aussies update their home and yard.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

        "text": "A majority of campgrounds in NSW are set to become more expensive with authorities looking to streamline reservation systems and thwart ghost bookings.\n\nAvid campers and lovers of the great outdoors have only hours left to have their say about controversial changes to how camping grounds are managed by authorities in NSW as a proposed overhaul to booking systems is set to see travellers pay more to stay in public national parks.\n\nThe NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) has invited community feedback on the comprehensive overhaul with the deadline for public consultation ending on Sunday, May 25.\n\nThe proposal includes pegging fees to increases in the consumer price index, meaning prices would rise each year. It will also categorise all campsites into a hierarchy, with each tier being more expensive.\n\nA simple clearing with no facilities will remain free while campgrounds from tier 2 to tier 5 (which make up 85 per cent of sites) will range from $22 per night in high season for the most basic campground to $65 for sites that have water and access to a flushable toilet. The top campsites, tier 6, which have hot showers and BBQ facilities, will cost $89 per night.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe proposal has seen critics take to social media with many worrying about the disappearance of an \"affordable way to have a holiday\".\n\nAmong those who have voiced concerns about the changes is Mike Atkinson, who appeared on the popular survivalist TV show Alone Australia and produces content about life in Australia's outdoors.\n\n\"The really serious thing is that they are introducing camping fees to an enormous percentage of campgrounds that never had them before,\" he told Yahoo News earlier this month.\n\n\"Never in the history of parks has there ever been a camping fee there... and now my guess is 60 to 70 per cent of campgrounds will have fees for the first time ever. I feel that the executives in NSW National Parks are running it like a business, and it's not, it's a public service.\"\n\nIt could soon cost nine times more for a camper to sleep overnight at Thredbo Diggings campground. Source: TikTok/ExplorOz/OutbackMike\n\nThe higher costs are needed due to record investment in campground infrastructure, increased park management costs and changing community expectations, the National Parks and Wildlife Service says.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe NSW parks service manages 895 parks and reserves which make up roughly 10 per cent of the state's total land mass. According to the consultation paper, visitation has grown 49 per cent over the last decade, and there are now more than 50 million visits to national parks every year, including 1.8 million overnight campground stays.\n\nIn a recent video, Mike highlighted the Thredbo Diggings Campground in the Kosciuszko National Park which he believes will go from $6 to as much as $54 under the proposed system.\n\nPart of the justification is to tackle the issue of ghost bookings, which has been a problem in campsites across the country where booking systems have been introduced. The perception of ghost bookings is a big part of the reason Victoria is not renewing its free camping initiate from July.\n\nAnother keen camper, Jay from CampingMates, highlighted the same site in a video discussing the overhaul and calling on people to provide feedback, and shared his own anecdote of ghost booking.\n\n\"Out of 41 campsites at Thredbo Diggings, when I was there 30 campsites were booked but I was the only person for the entire campsite,\" he said.\n\nThose opposed to the changes say there is other ways to tackle the problem without raising prices on campers, such as automatic reminders and prompts to ensure cancellations are made.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith hours left to provide feedback, the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service says all public input will still be considered. You can do so here.\n\n\"All feedback on the proposal, which aims to introduce more consistent and simplified state-wide camping fees and bookings for NSW national parks and reserves will be carefully considered,\" a spokesperson told Yahoo News.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
