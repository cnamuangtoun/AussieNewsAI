        "text": "The Tasmanian government will pull the plug on greyhound racing in the state by 2029, making it the first Australian state to phase out the competitive betting industry.\n\nNewly-reinstated Premier Jeremy Rockliff announced today his government would cease funding for greyhound racing in the state in four years' time, which will effectively wipe out the industry in Tasmania.\n\n\"I'm concerned about the future of the industry and continue to be concerned about animal welfare,\" Rockliff said.\n\nThe Tasmanian government will phase out funding for greyhound racing by 2029. (Getty)\n\n\"It's time to draw a line in the sand and ensure an orderly exit from greyhound racing in Tasmania.\"\n\nThe Tasmanian government said it would cut public funding by June 30, 2029.\n\nIt will be the second jurisdiction in Australia \u2013 and the first state \u2013 to cut government funding for greyhound racing after the ACT banned it in 2018.\n\nRockliff acknowledged the announcement would make some industry members \"extremely disappointed\" but said the decision was made as greyhound racing no longer aligns with community values.\n\n\"As we deliver a measured and sensible phase-out of greyhound racing, I want to be crystal clear on my support for the broader racing industry, its participants, and our regional communities,\" he said.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Six men on the run after teenager allegedly slashed with machete in Melbourne\n\nPremier of Tasmania Jeremy Rockliff said the announcement would likely disappoint the industry. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\n\"I know there are many participants in the industry who care deeply for their animals who will be extremely disappointed by this policy decision.\n\n\"But the reality is the greyhound industry is at the crossroads, is in decline and it is increasingly clear it does not align with community expectations.\"\n\nA parliamentary committee will oversee the transition until 2029.\n\nGreyhound racing in Tasmania is almost 100 per cent dependent on state funding, according to the Australian Financial Review.\n\nIt was reported the state was spending more than twice the national average to keep the greyhound racing industry afloat, with $7.5 million in funding alone in 2024-25.\n\nAnimal advocacy groups have called for a national ban on greyhound racing in Australia.\n\nGreyhound racing was also banned in New Zealand last year.",

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)\n\nOn August 1, new regulations in Hong Kong came into effect, allowing companies to apply for a licence to issue stablecoins.\n\nUnlike more typical cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, whose value fluctuates wildly, the value of stablecoins is pegged to that of currencies or commodities, removing the volatility that deters some investors.\n\nThey don't just account for pocket change, either.\n\nAccording to ANZ, stablecoin transactions were worth $US27.6 trillion ($42.5 trillion) last year alone.\n\nThat's more than all transactions made using Visa and Mastercard combined, and about 15 times the value of the entire Australian economy.\n\nHong Kong isn't the only jurisdiction to regulate stablecoins recently.\n\nUS President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act (officially the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act) on July 18, one of three major bills to clear the House during what was touted as \"crypto week\".\n\nUnlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, stablecoins' value is intended to be more reliable. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)\n\n\"The regulations in the US and Hong Kong have attracted significant market attention,\" ANZ chief greater China economist Raymond Yeung wrote.\n\n\"Companies involved in issuing and trading stablecoins have seen their stock prices rally massively.\"\n\nIn Australia, meanwhile, the RBA has ruled out the idea of a central bank digital currency for now, but announced the start of a trial of tokenised currencies\ufeff, including stablecoins, in July.\n\nNot that everyone thinks they're a good idea.\n\nLaw professor and prominent crypto critic Hilary Allen compared the GENIUS Act to the pre-regulated financial era that led to the Great Depression.\n\nDonald Trump signed the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins last month. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\n\"It won't just be crypto taking advantage, it'll be everybody,\" Allen told CNN last month.\n\n\"And then we get to unregulated markets for all kinds of investments, which is where we were in the 1920s, and we saw how that ended.\"\ufeff\n\nThe Hong Kong regulations come as some Chinese tech giants, including e-commerce behemoth JD.com and the Alibaba-linked Ant Group, have reportedly pushed Beijing to allow stablecoins linked to the yuan to counter the surge of US dollar-backed crypto.\n\nMore than a few commentators and analysts have talked of Hong Kong acting as a testing ground for the mainland.\n\n\"The emergence of stablecoins in the 2020s gave hope to the internationalisation of the (yuan), and the passing of Hong Kong's stablecoins ordinance was viewed as a further step in that direction,\" Yeung said.\n\nAt the same time, it's no secret China wants to get away from the reliance on the US dollar in international transactions, and promote the yuan in its place.\n\nSo could a yuan-backed stablecoin offer a way to do just that?\n\nREAD MORE: Where your dog sits in the car could cost you thousands in fines \ufeff\n\nChina wants to decouple from the US dollar and promote its own currency in its place. (Chinatopix via AP)\n\nAccording to Yeung, even if Beijing does allow them, a stablecoin on its own won't drive dedollarisation \u2013 it'll come down to a host of other factors.\n\n\"Some observers think it could help,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But it's likely any currency diversification will depend on the popularity of the yuan, rather than any one technology\u2026\n\n\"Should China want to allocate less foreign reserve to $US, then stablecoins backed by other currencies are the alternative, not the yuan-backed stablecoin.\n\n\"The issuance of yuan-backed stablecoin requires sufficient high-quality liquid assets.\n\n\"This could be limited by the issuers' access to renminbi deposits, offshore China sovereign and sub-sovereign bonds and their access to the onshore bond market.\n\n\"Stablecoin issuance, and their reserve funds, will increase demand for these assets.\n\n\"But ultimately, the success of renminbi internationalisation will drive yuan-backed stablecoins \u2014 not the other way round.\"",

Contact reporter Maddison Leach at mleach@nine.com.au\n\nWhat is UGC and how does it work?\n\nUGC is digital \ufeffcontent created by everyday people and/or influencers to promote products or services for brands.\n\nUGC can be used to promote everything from skincare, to restaurants, \ufeffthe latest tech products, and online services.\n\nBrands typically provide free products or services to UGC creators in exchange for them making content about it.\n\nSome brands also pay creators a fee to create content or to use \ufeffit for advertising.\n\nCommon examples of UGC include:\n\n\ufeffunboxings\n\nproduct reviews\n\nskincare routines\n\nrecipe hacks\n\nREAD MORE: Grim data reveals how a global superpower is on the brink of disaster\n\nThe UGC Sullens creates is predominantly beauty, wellness and lifestyle content. (TikTok/@ugc.ashlee)\n\nWhat sets UGC apart from traditional branded content\ufeff is that it's usually shot \"on a phone, in real homes, by real users\".\n\n\"UGC is relatable, cost-effective and often performs better than polished brand ads because it feels like a recommendation, not a sales pitch,\" said Felicity Grey, founder and managing director at Theory Crew\ufeff, a social media marketing and PR agency.\n\nIt can also help everyday Aussies make extra cash on the side.\ufeff\n\nSullens first noticed UGC on her social media feeds in 2023 and decided to give it a go.\n\nUsing her background in social media marketing, she started by filming videos about \"random products\" she had lying around the house on her iPhone.\n\n\"Before I knew it, I had brands reaching out to work together,\" she told 9news.com.au.\n\nThe \ufeffbrand deals started small but were a great boost to her part-time income.\n\nWant a pay rise?

(Supplied/Ashlee Sullens)\n\n\"Everyday people are turning their creativity into careers, getting paid to produce content from their own homes,\" Grey said.\n\n\"You don't need a huge following, just a camera, a spark of creativity, and a willingness to show up authentically on screen.\"\ufeff\n\nHow do you become a UGC creator?\n\nGetting started as a UGC creator is fairly simple, according to both Sullens and Grey.\n\n\"Shoot content in natural light, use your own voice, and focus on being helpful or entertaining,\" Grey advised.\n\n\"You don't need a massive audience, just a clear idea of what makes a good piece of content. And don't be afraid to put yourself out there.\"\n\nYou don't need to invest in any fancy tech either.\ufeff\n\nSullens began with an iPhone and didn't pay for a tripod, microphone or editing software until she was already making money from UGC.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump calls on Intel CEO to resign for alleged ties to China\n\nSullens said Aussies don't need to invest in fancy tech to start making UGC.

(ABC News: Robert Koenig-Luck)\n\n\"There's an extraordinary amount of additional work looking after cats,\" he said.\n\n\"Most of them are not microchipped so you can't easily find the owners of these cats, so a lot of them then don't get claimed and they end up being moved on to Cat Haven.\"\n\nMichelle Muller has been running the Wagin Cat Rescue with her husband Larry Stanbridge, a local ranger, for about four years and believes owners need to take more responsibility.\n\nLarry Stanbridge is a local ranger and also runs the Wagin Cat Rescue with his wife. (Supplied: Michelle Muller)\n\n\"The lack of understanding that cats need to be sterilised, they need to be microchipped, they need to be registered to the shire,\" she said.\n\n\"Not having your cat sterilised is the biggest issue, because they just continue to breed and we had one household alone had over 40 cats that got out.\"\n\nChallenges with containment\n\nSupport for containment laws among local governments in the state is strong, with at least 80 in favour of permanent containment for pet cats, according to a WA Feral Cat Working Group survey released last month.\n\nBut attempts to introduce stricter local laws have fallen foul of state parliament, which has oversight of the regulation local governments attempt to introduce.\n\nOf the 26 councils that have tried to introduce containment laws under the WA Cat Act, only the shires of Northam, Narrogin and Christmas Island have been successful.\n\nThe Shire of Pingelly's cat containment policy, known as the Save the Numbats Local Law, is waiting to go before the recently reformed joint standing committee after its first attempt was knocked back last year.\n\nThe City of Bayswater's cat containment laws have been recommended for disallowance by the committee and are listed for the Legislative Council in September.\n\nThe Wagin Shire has chosen not to go down that path, at least for now.\n\n\"If we were to expand that out further, as many other shires have tried to do, they run up against some state government resistance to changes to cat local laws,\" Mr Blight said.\n\n\"We may well go further and look at the containment part of it down the track; it will largely be dependent on if those other councils succeed or if they have not.\"\n\nPhillip Blight says household limits on cats is a first step. (Supplied)\n\nThe battle with ferals\n\nVeterinarian Kate Clayton, who owns clinics in the nearby towns of Kojonup and Katanning, said feral cats were the real problem.\n\n\"The feline AIDS virus and the feline leukaemia virus are endemic in the feral population, and those retroviruses do not have any cure and they can be life-threatening,\" she said.\n\n\"Owned cats, if they're outside and they come in contact with a feral cat that is infected, they can become infected themselves.\"\n\nEdiegarrup Reserve is a former farming property undergoing restoration, sitting between Fitzgerald and Stirling national parks. (Supplied: Greenman Media)\n\nFurther south, 145 feral cats have been culled in the past five years as part of a fauna recovery project in an area surrounding the Fitzgerald River and Stirling Range national parks.\n\nThe culling of 3,500 foxes, feral cats and rabbits through baiting, trapping and shooting across 50,000 hectares involved 2,000 volunteers, 20 private landowners, a conservation group and a state agency.\n\nJeff Pinder says the Bush Heritage project to remove feral animals was highly collaborative. (Supplied: Nic Duncan)\n\nProject officer Jeff Pinder said the collaborative approach was needed, especially when dealing with varying landscapes.\n\n\"As much as we could remove a number, we were being reinvaded by additional animals from outside, and that emphasises the importance of creating a buffer around key reserves so that you can try and add that extra layer of protection,\" he said.\n\nCamera footage in the final year of the project showing a chuditch, a threatened species also known as a western quoll, was positive news for the project.\n\nA chuditch has been sighted at Monjebup Reserve. (Supplied: Bush Heritage Australia)\n\n\"We can't hang our hat on that and say, 'Yes, we've created a new population', but it does show a level of survivorship,\" Mr Pinder said.\n\n\"There was another sighting as well in Corackerup Nature Reserve, so there's a suggestion that animal may be coming back into our landscape.\n\n\"It's a sort of watch this space and hopefully through our management efforts we continue to see chuditch in our reserves.\"",

(ABC Rural: Brandon Long)\n\n\"I would have done that route [Longreach to Roma] numerous times, I don't know how many times but done it quite a fair bit,\" he said.\n\n\"Some years were flat out, and then other years I've had a couple of quieter years compared to some blokes around.\n\n\"It's all about the stock routes to me ... hopefully they keep maintained so travelling stock will always get through.\"\n\nAbout 1,670 head of cattle travelled 770 kilometres from Longreach to Roma over three months. (ABC Rural: Brandon Long)\n\nParticipants were provided a horse, meals and transfers to the nearest town \u2014 a \"bit different\" to the drives Mr Prow was used to.\n\n\"I've never had that many people around me before around the mob of cattle,\" he said.\n\n\"They've been pretty good ... they always try to listen to what you're trying to say. They don't get in the middle of them [the cattle] too much.\"\n\nCountry musician James Blundell makes an appearance at the camp. (ABC Rural: Brandon Long)\n\nAffectionately called the \"tourists\" around camp, there were plenty of authentic droving moments for volunteers along the way, such as bad weather and the herd spooking.\n\n\"A few wet days back there and they've only had the one rush, so that's not too bad with a mob of travelling cattle,\" Mr Prow said.\n\nFor \"tourist\" Dean Nalder, the event was a chance to get back in the saddle for the first time in 20 years.\n\n\"I grew up in the bush and we had horses on the farm when I was a kid,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of people back home in Perth were horrified that I was doing such a thing.\n\n\"But I've been pleasantly surprised.

        "text": "The RBA Board is meeting this week (on Monday and Tuesday) to discuss interest rates.\n\nIt surprised markets last month by keeping rates on hold, but analysts think we will see a rate cut this week.\n\nRate cuts feed into higher house prices, so what should we expect?\n\nHome price climb continues despite interest rate pause Photo shows A drone shot of rows of houses in Shell Cove, Wollongong's south. Australian property prices have scaled new record highs as demand for housing offsets buyer concerns about the Reserve Bank's shock call to hold interest rates steady.\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank's chief economist, Luke Yeaman (a former deputy secretary of the Commonwealth Treasury), and associate economist Lucinda Jerogin, updated their forecasts recently.\n\nThe CBA is Australia's largest home lender, so it has a clear interest in having accurate house price forecasts.\n\nThey said by the end of this year, home price rises would be higher than they were previously thinking, but next year prices will probably rise by less than they were previously thinking.\n\n\"We now expect growth of 6 per cent in 2025 (previously 4 per cent) and 4 per cent in 2026 (previously 5 per cent),\" they wrote. \"The upward revision this year reflects current market momentum, a still sound labour market and strong real household disposable incomes. \"However, given our forecast for a relatively shallow interest rate cycle, easing population growth and continued headwinds in the construction sector, this home price upswing is still expected to be relatively modest and taper out in 2026.\"\n\nTheir forecast is conditional on the RBA cutting rates by 25 basis points this week, and by another 25bp in November.\n\nIf the RBA cuts rates again after that, in early 2026, it could see a stronger rise in property prices than they're forecasting.\n\nThey say Australia's housing affordability woes are far from over, in this situation.\n\n\"There is little cause for celebration,\" they say.\n\nWhat home price growth can we expect this rate-cutting cycle?\n\nYeaman and Jerogin say interest rates are the dominant driver of property prices in the short run (when the supply of housing is fixed).\n\nThey say their statistical models suggest 100 basis points of interest rate cuts could see home prices (as measured by the Cotality National Hedonic Home Value Index) rise by 9 per cent.\n\nThe RBA has already cut rates by 50bp this year (in February and May combined), and a rate cut this week (25bp), followed by another rate cut in November (25bp), would bring the total to 100bp.\n\nInflation eases further in June quarter Photo shows Cost of living image of old hand holding cash with bills, calculator, glasses and cup of tea The \"trimmed mean\" measure of inflation \u2014 the Reserve Bank's preferred measure of underlying inflation \u2014 has also declined.\n\nHowever, they say if the RBA cuts rates again in early 2026, by another 25bp, that would lift the expected interest rate impact on home prices from 9 per cent to 11.5 per cent.\n\nThey say the expected increase in property prices will not be good for housing affordability.\n\nThat figure of 6 per cent annual price growth is also a national figure.\n\nDwelling prices are forecast to grow at very different rates across Australia's major cities in 2025.\n\nThey're forecasting annual growth of 13 per cent for Darwin, 8 per cent for Brisbane, 7 per cent for Perth, and 6 per cent for Adelaide and Canberra.\n\nBut next year, those rates of growth are forecast to be much lower (at this stage).\n\nAre the long-run drivers of interest rates stabilising?\n\nYeaman and Jerogin say the long-run drivers of interest rates appear to be stabilising.\n\nThey say real household disposable income is recovering strongly back towards trend levels.\n\nPopulation growth is expected to continue easing through 2025 and 2026, which will take pressure off housing demand and prices.\n\nHas high immigration fallen out of favour in Australia? Photo shows The corner of a piece of paper which reads 'Australian Government, Department of Home Affairs'. Some of the harshest criticism of high immigration is coming from people who work for the exact organisations that have supported high immigration for decades.\n\nThey expect a modest pick-up in new construction activity. (As interest rates come down, you typically see a lift in building approvals, feeding into higher completions.)\n\nThey say \"household size\" has also increased again, after collapsing during the pandemic, as cost-of-living pressures, falling housing affordability and higher rents have led to more people living together under the same roof (which helps to reduce demand for housing).\n\n\"The combination of lower population growth and rising construction activity should see the flow of housing supply and demand move closer to balance by the end of 2026,\" they say.\n\n\"Estimates from the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council suggest underlying housing demand will exceed underlying supply over 2025 and 2026, but the gap is closing.\n\n\"This should take some pressure off house prices,\" they say.\n\nHowever, they say housing affordability will remain a \"significant challenge\" for home buyers, especially first home buyers.\n\nWhat does it mean for first home hopefuls?\n\nThey say over the long term, home price growth should broadly match growth in household incomes.\n\nBut in contemporary Australia, home price growth has consistently exceeded income growth.\n\nSince 1990, real home prices have grown by 3.3 per cent a year, while real household disposable income has only grown by 2.9 per cent. That makes a big difference over 35 years.\n\nOver that period, they say a structural shift towards lower interest rates and easier access to credit have allowed price-to-income ratios to rise.\n\nStrong population growth, coupled with relatively unresponsive supply, has also contributed to higher property prices.\n\n\"This has made Australia's housing market one of the least affordable in the world,\" they say. \"The ratio of real median house prices to real household disposable income is 7.9, according to Cotality. \"And Sydney and Melbourne rank among the least affordable global cities.\n\nThey say, according to the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council, affordability deteriorated in 2024, with 50 per cent of median household income needed to meet repayments for the average mortgage.\n\nHousing debt servicing costs as a percentage of disposable income also surged to record levels last year.\n\nWhy mega landlords 'can't lose' Photo shows A drone shot of rows of houses in Shell Cove, Wollongong's south. Despite the surge in interest rates and a jump in loss-making rentals, few landlords are selling up. Experts say it's because negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount protect their investments.\n\n\"The rate of decline in affordability has slowed since 2023, as real household disposable incomes picked up and financing costs have eased,\" they say.\n\n\"While this trend is expected to continue in coming years, there is little cause for celebration.\n\n\"Our calculation of housing affordability, based on the percentage of pre-tax income directed towards the mortgage for a dual average full-time income household buying a median priced dwelling, suggests unaffordability peaked \u2026 in November 2024.\n\n\"Affordability is estimated to improve over the next two years, even as dwelling prices rise.\n\n\"Notwithstanding, housing affordability will remain stretched in a historical sense, particularly relative to pandemic lows.\"",

(Supplied)\n\n'Whopping bank balance'\n\nThe soft-cap rules mean AFL clubs can spend $7.67 million on their men\u2019s program in 2025, with that amount increasing by $750,000 in 2026, and a further $350,000 in 2027.\n\nHarley Reid touted as future AFL great Photo shows Harley Reid Luke Shuey believes Harley Reid will become an AFL great, as the midfielder grapples with scrutiny over how he approaches the game.\n\nIf club\u2019s spend more than that limit, they are hit with a tax, which varies depending on how far over the limit they are.\n\n\"They're one of the clubs that actually could (pay the tax) no problems at all,\" Bell, who won two premierships with North Melbourne, said on ABC Perth's Sports Talk program.\n\n\"They've got a whopping bank balance that is just sitting there, so should they on a short-term basis, say 'we're going to try and improve our number of development coaches to players ratio, and we're going to go over the soft cap. We're going to write out the cheque'.\n\n\"Because that's going to, if they choose the coaches right, that has to expedite the development process.\"\n\nLook further afield\n\nBell said the club should also commit to filling its entire list of players, including Category B players, for a decade, in the hope it finds some decent performers from outside the AFL pathway.\n\n\"Go to Ireland if there's not enough (talent) within your own academy,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a numbers game.

(AAP/Richard Wainwright)\n\nWest Coast coach Andrew McQualter has flagged he wants to bring in experienced players to fill the mid-20 age bracket, an area the club is struggling in.\n\nBell said the Eagles should do that through drafting and not trading.\n\n\"You need your high-end draft picks to go to the draft. Nail your picks, get them right, and develop them,\" he said.\n\n\"If you want to bring some experience in, have a look at players you can bring in as delisted free-agents, free-agents, or at worst maybe a pick slide with one of your own picks.\n\n\"Players will move for opportunity, but some of the teams up the top may need to shed some total player payment.\n\n\"So can we attract a player that's not getting an opportunity, that's a big contract, which West Coast can afford, can we get that player and can we get another draft pick?\"\n\nWho should they bring over?\n\nExamples of players the Eagles could target include Deven Robertson and Brandon Starcevich at Brisbane, Adelaide's Luke Peddler, or Elijah Tsatas from Essendon.\n\nDeven Robertson has been linked with a return to Western Australia after managing just 46 games in almost six seasons at Brisbane.

        "text": "The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) shocked many in the finance sector when it voted against cutting the cash rate last month.\n\nThe news came as a blow to people paying off home loans, who hoped a rate cut would reduce their mortgage bills.\n\nMany are now looking towards the next meeting with anticipation.\n\nHere's what you need to know before the next RBA's next monetary policy meeting.\n\nWhen does the RBA meet next?\n\nTomorrow.\n\nBut it's a two-day meeting, so we won't hear about the decision until Tuesday afternoon.\n\nWe're expecting an announcement at 2.30pm AEST on Tuesday, August 12.\n\nWill there be a rate cut?\n\nWe can't say for sure.\n\nHowever, many people are banking on one after the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) published the quarterly inflation figures at the end of July.\n\nRate cut 'seems a done deal' amid falling inflation Photo shows Cost of living image of old hand holding cash with bills, calculator, glasses and cup of tea The \"trimmed mean\" measure of inflation \u2014 the Reserve Bank's preferred measure of underlying inflation \u2014 has also declined.\n\nThose figures showed inflation was now well and truly within the RBA's preferred range of between 2 and 3 per cent.\n\nWithin the inflation data, there were two main figures people were paying attention to:\n\nHeadline inflation: 2.1 per cent\n\n2.1 per cent Trimmed mean: 2.7 per cent\n\nThe trimmed mean is also called \"underlying inflation\".\n\nThe trimmed mean is the statistic the RBA had previously said it was focusing on to measure inflation, which meant a lot of people were watching for that figure in particular.\n\nOn the graph below, you can see headline inflation \u2014 the red line \u2014 has been within the RBA's target range for longer than the trimmed mean.\n\nHeadline inflation reached that range in September last year.\n\nBut the trimmed mean \u2014 the blue line \u2014 only reached that range in March, when it hit 2.9 per cent.\n\nWhat is the cash rate target?\n\nCurrently, the cash rate target is 3.85 per cent.\n\nThis figure is often referred to as \"the interest rate\" in conversation, but it's not the rate people with mortgages pay.\n\n\"The cash rate is the interest rate that banks pay to borrow funds from other banks in the money market overnight,\" the RBA's website says.\n\n\"It influences all other interest rates, including mortgage and deposit rates.\"\n\nThat's why, if you're paying interest on a loan, your interest rate is probably higher than 3.85 per cent.\n\nWhen the RBA changes the cash rate target, interest rates for mortgages don't automatically change \u2014 the individual banks decide that.\n\nWhy didn't the RBA cut rates last time?\n\nThe RBA said it was waiting on more data.\n\nMany people expected the RBA to cut rates at the July meeting off the back of monthly inflation data from the ABS.\n\nThe RBA has repeatedly said it wants Australia's inflation to get down to 2 to 3 per cent \u2014 and that monthly data was within that range.\n\nHowever, that was monthly data, not quarterly data, which takes in three months at a time.\n\nAnd it's this quarterly data that's regarded as Australia's key inflation measure.\n\nAt the time of the July meeting, the most recent batch of quarterly data had come out in April \u2014 and the RBA wanted to wait until the next drop of inflation figures at the end July.\n\nNow those figures are out.\n\nAnd they look promising for people hoping for a rate cut.\n\nWe'll find out what's happening with rates on Tuesday afternoon. (ABC News: Dannielle Maguire)\n\nWhen will interest rates go down?\n\nNo one can say for sure.\n\nIf the RBA does cut the cash rate target, that doesn't mean mortgage interest rates will automatically go down.\n\nIt'll be up to the banks to decide if they'll pass that cut on to customers.\n\nSo if you have a mortgage, you'll have to wait to hear from your lending institution about whether your rates are changing.\n\nWe typically hear from the major banks within a few hours of the RBA's decision, though, so you probably won't have to wait very long.\n\nHowever, there is often a lag between banks announcing they'll cut their interest rates and that cut taking effect.\n\nThey usually keep charging the higher rate for a week or two before the rate goes down \u2014 meaning it could be about a fortnight before people paying off a loan start to see any savings on their bills.",

(ABC News: Brant Cumming)\n\nThe 6-kilowatt wind turbine was used to power CPB Contractors's construction site, and project manager Andrew Coonan said that there were advantages to having an energy source that can potentially run all day.\n\n\"Obviously the sun doesn't shine 24 hours of the day \u2026 so we really see this as integrating into the mix of energy sources,\" Mr Coonan said.\n\n\"Our compounds typically are powered by fossil fuels and having to tap into the [electricity] network, so having the ability to use wind power, solar power, sometimes there's bio-fuel generators that can be used as well.\n\n\"Having a real mix in there, means we can get away from fossil fuels for our projects.\"\n\nAndrew Coonan says the turbine could become part of the mix of energy sources used. (ABC News: Brant Cumming)\n\nAim for commercial version to be ready next year\n\nVAWT-X Energy managing director Gary Andrews said it had taken several years to create the current prototype, but he hoped he would have a product ready for manufacture within 12 months.\n\n\"The aim is to learn from it to see what faults there are and find solutions to fix those and have a commercial version by early next year,\" Mr Andrews said.\n\n\"Solar only operates during the day, so if you want to go off-grid, ideally, you want to be able to have the potential to be able to generate electricity 24/7.\n\n\"So if you have solar and a wind turbine, then you're potentially getting electricity day and night.\"\n\nGary Andrews hopes to start manufacturing the turbines within a year. (ABC News: Brant Cumming)\n\nMr Andrews said he hoped to be able to manufacture locally in South Australia and wants to keep the cost to around $36,000, plus installation.\n\n\"We hope that this will be adopted across Australia and elsewhere in the world as a form of distributed renewable energy,\" Mr Andrews said.\n\nThe project has been given support from federal and South Australian governments, including a $300,000 grant from the Department of State Development.\n\nMinister for Climate, Environment and Water, Susan Close, said the vertical axis wind turbine was an \"exciting development\".\n\n\"This wind turbine is able to capture more energy from low wind, which means is more useful for longer,\" she said.\n\n\"You would expect that the state that is the most switched on in Australia for wind and solar would see the most innovation, and that's exactly what's happening.\"\n\nSusan Close says the turbine is an \"exciting development\". (ABC News: Carl Saville)\n\nSmall-scale turbines could fill the niche\n\nDavid Burton, from Monash University's Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, said large wind farms that use horizontal axis wind turbines have dominated the global wind energy market.\n\nMr Burton said they had been found to be more commercially viable than vertical axis options like the VAWT-X prototype.\n\n\"As a general rule, horizontal axis turbines are significantly more efficient than vertical axis wind turbines \u2026 so primarily that's the challenge,\" he said.\n\n\"There's quite a large number of manufacturers who have delved into that [vertical] technology, previously \u2026 it's not a new thing.\n\n\" The advantage of a vertical axis wind turbine is that it doesn't need to face the wind so it tends to perform the same, regardless of the wind direction. \"\n\nBut Mr Burton said smaller scale turbines could potentially be the best way for the vertical technology to find its niche.\n\n\"If I was to look at a place for vertical axis wind then it's in the area that they're targeting, that sort of application seems to be the most logical,\" he said.\n\n\"That seems to be where the technology is most likely to succeed, at least at this stage.\"",

        "text": "The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is widely expected to cut the cash rate when it meets on 12 August.\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomists are predicting a drop of 0.25 percentage points from 3.85 to 3.6 per cent., following the RBA\u2019s surprise decision in July to hold rates steady despite easing inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf announced, a cut could help lift consumer sentiment amid global uncertainty, but some experts are warning that the benefits are a 'double-edged sword'.\n\n\n\nHow likely is a rate cut?\n\nEconomists say two factors are likely to influence the RBA's decision: easing inflation and growing unemployment.\n\n\n\nRising unemployment levels could be a sign that the RBA will cut interest rates on Tuesday Source: AAP / Joel Carrett The Australian Bureau of Statistic's (ABS) June quarter Consumer Price Index figures showed annual inflation easing from 2.4 to 2.1 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nJune labour figures from the ABS also show unemployment has risen to its highest level since November 2021 at 4.2 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you put rising unemployment, overlay that with disinflationary trends, and then you look at the GDP report which painted a really tepid picture of growth for the Australian economy , it really does warrant further interest rate cuts,\" IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Sally Tindall from financial comparison site Canstar says that while a cut is \"highly likely\", it\u2019s important to remember that \"nothing is guaranteed until the RBA actually does make that decision at 2.30pm on Tuesday\".\n\n\n\nWho benefits from an interest rate cut?\n\nTindall said mortgage holders can expect to see the biggest benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The winners are mortgage customers, particularly those who use the market to their advantage by going and haggling with their bank or refinancing,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople thinking of buying a home may also have more borrowing power. Households that earn $150,000 before tax may be able to access more than $17,000 extra.\n\n\n\n\n\nTindall urged caution because rate cuts can sometimes be a \"double-edged sword\" as it can lead to an increase in house prices.\n\n\n\nWhy could an interest rate cut mean higher house prices?\n\nMore buyers on the market squeezes an already short supply of houses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It brings buyers to the market, buyers have deeper pockets and they can spend more on a home,\" Domain\u2019s Nicola Powell says.\n\n\n\n\n\nA report from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) found the RBA\u2019s February reduction in the cash rate saw housing prices increase by 3.1 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt forecasts that RBA rate cuts in August and November would lead to house prices rising by 6 per cent in 2025 and 4 per cent in 2026.\n\n\n\nWhere will housing prices be affected?\n\nCapital cities tend to see bigger shifts, with Sydney and Melbourne more sensitive to interest rates changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CBA also forecasts that an interest rate cut could lead to house price increases of 8 per cent in Brisbane, 7 per cent in Perth and 6 per cent in Adelaide.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News\n\n\n\nBut Canstar\u2019s Tindall says this is not a reason why the RBA shouldn\u2019t reduce the cash rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What will help cool the situation is increased stock, and I think that still needs further intervention from the government,\" she said.\n\n\n\nWhat about people who don't own a home?\n\nTindall says renters may also be hit with higher costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rents are rising at four-and-a-half per cent every year, which is a difficult hurdle for many households to clear, and unfortunately it's still going to be tough times ahead for renters.\"\n\n\n\nAn RBA interest rate cut could make renting less affordable Source: AAP / Lukas Coch Sycamore from IG Markets says a common knock-on effect of higher house prices is that landlords may be encouraged to put up rent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And that\u2019s not really something we need at this point in time.\"\n\n\n\nSo is an interest rate cut a good or a bad thing?\n\nSycamore says an interest rate cut would be a symbol of growing optimism in the Australian market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is real benefit in terms of just lifting the gloom which has really been lingering over the Australian economy since COVID, because that's when the cost of living crisis really came to the forefront,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTindall says it is a good time to re-examine your finances to make sure you\u2019re getting the best deal for your circumstances, especially since interest rate cuts are not always passed on by banks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat ultimately matters is the rate you\u2019re currently on.\"\n\n\n\n",

Picture: Willy Weather\n\nRunners in Sydney\u2019s City2Surf have faced wet conditions as competitors come across the finish line at Bondi.\n\nThere was plenty of rain on the radar shortly before 8am on Sunday as the first groups of runners began the 14km course.\n\nThere would have been some regretful sighs as people laced up in the early hours; areas of Sydney received about 6mm of rain between 4.30am and 7am.\n\nFemale winner Bronte Oates, 20 of Sydney, came across the line in 45:51, behind male winner Isaac Heyne who clocked 40:33. Heyne, 25 years old from Adelaide, won the men\u2019s division for the second year in a row.\n\nThe weather turned toward the end of the race. Picture: NewsWire / Monique Harmer\n\nVideos posted online show pouring rain, with runners trudging away from the finish line, medals around their necks, drenched from the showers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSome competitors found time and co-ordination to post videos as they ran, with further videos showing a sea of sneakers stomping through puddles.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology rain gauge in the city at Millers Point recorded 8.2mm of rain from 9am to 11am, while the Canterbury gauge showed 9.4mm in the same period.\n\nWinds gusts are getting up to 30km/h in the late morning.\n\nIsaac Heyne, centre, won the men\u2019s division. Picture: NewsWire / Monique Harmer\n\nBronte Oates, centre, won the women\u2019s division. Picture: NewsWire / Monique Harmer\n\nSydney\u2019s City2Surf is billed as the world\u2019s largest fun run, and has raised $59m since 2008. About $3.5m has been raised for 600 charities this year.\n\nRoads shut because of the event are reopening from 11.30am, and most roads in Bondi and Bondi Junction are expected to be reopen by 4pm.\n\nSunday\u2019s patchy weather comes after forecasts a massive cloud bank - estimated to be roughly the size of Western Australia - would soak millions of Aussies throughout the weekend.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt would be only the latest drenching for Sydneysiders, with the city recording its wettest August in almost a decade, according to Weatherzone.\n\nSydney is forecast to receive up to 10mm of rain on Sunday. Picture: Willy Weather\n\nElsewhere in NSW, flood waters are easing in the northwestern slopes of New England. Major flooding at Wee Waa continues to fall, after the Naomi River peaked on Thursday night.\n\nBut the river is causing minor flooding to the west at Bugilbone and is forecast to rise Sunday night into Monday.\n\nThe Namoi River at Goangra was at 5.57m and rising on Saturday, the Bureau of Meteorology says. The river may exceed the moderate flood level (6.7m) on Wednesday and could reach 7.50m on Friday.\n\nElsewhere, there are frost warnings in place Sunday for much of regional Victoria. People in parts of the Northern Country, North Central, North East, Central, West and South Gippsland and East Gippsland should be wary of frost.",
