(Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nIt comes amid persistent property price rises nationwide, despite renewed cost of living pressures on the eve of a forecast interest rate hike.\n\nThe newly released Home Value Index also shows that it is the most affordable properties - those in the lowest quarter of the price range - where prices are rising fastest, in a trend that risks pushing home ownership ever further out of reach for thousands of Australians.\n\nWhile Sydney remains by far the most unaffordable city for house ownership, with a median price of $1,598,819, growth has slowed to just 0.3 per cent in January.\n\n\ufeffNationally, the value of Australian homes (both houses and apartments) rose by 0.8 per cent in January, according to Cotality's Home Value Index - a slight uptick from 0.6 per cent in December. \ufeff\n\nStubbornly high property prices are a fresh blow to prospective home buyers who are bracing for a cut to their borrowing power if the Reserve Bank hikes interest rates tomorrow as forecast.\n\n\"Despite the most unaffordable conditions on record in many cities, along with a rebound in cost of living pressures and prospect of a rate hike as early as (tomorrow), we are still seeing a broad-based rise in housing values,\" Cotality's research director Tim Lawless said.\n\nHowever, Lawless suggested price rises are likely to ease this year, as demand eased and forecast interest rate hikes limited people's ability to service larger mortgages.\n\nFewer homes are being put on the market this month compared to the same time last year.

(Supplied: Newcrest)\n\n\"This case follows \u2026 three years of investigation by the community, [looking] at the impact upon their properties from the dust and water pollution, \" principal lawyer Oliver Gayner said.\n\nMr Gayner said the community felt it had \"no choice\" other than to litigate.\n\n\"They've communicated those science-based results to the mine operator and sought a collaborative process to try and resolve the pollution issues, but those requests have been refused,\" he said.\n\nWater scientist Dr Ian Wright has contributed his expertise to the community's testing program. (ABC Central West: Micaela Hambrett)\n\nCommunity members are seeking compensation from the mining giant, saying the pollution has damaged their property values through a \"toxic trifecta\" of air, surface and groundwater pollution.\n\nThey are also seeking an injunction to restrain further pollution from the Cadia site, which has a production rate of more than 30 million tonnes of ore a year.\n\n\"Success for us is not about money, it will be measured by the change in operations at Cadia,\" Mr Gayner said.\n\nIn a statement, Newmont Cadia confirmed it had been served with proceedings in the Supreme Court of NSW and would \"respond through the appropriate legal processes\".\n\n\"As the matter is before court, it is not appropriate to comment further at this time,\" the statement read.\n\nDust up\n\nResidents of the Cadia and Errowanbang valleys near Orange flagged pollution concerns with the NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) in 2018, after the mine's tailings dam wall collapsed.\n\nJann Harries, who lives 2 kilometres from the mine's boundary, said the impact of the structural failure was obvious.\n\n\"Everything was covered in off-white dust, day in, day out,\" Ms Harries said.\n\n\"It had that taste and smell, if I breathed it in, I'd start coughing.\"\n\nA photograph taken at Jann Harries fence line during a dust event in May, 2023. (Supplied: Cadia Community Sustainability Network)\n\nConcerns were raised again after extractor fans over an underground crusher were found to be blasting unfiltered dust into the atmosphere at 18 times the legal limit.\n\nDrinking water tanks on neighbouring properties were subsequently found to contain heavy metals, including lead.\n\nFuture implications\n\nThe class action is being bankrolled by UK litigation fund Aristata, whose executives travelled from London to visit allegedly affected farms last year.\n\nIn a statement, head of portfolio management, Michael Hartridge, called the case \"important\", saying it supported the \"UN's sustainable development goals\".\n\nClaimants said they were not arguing the mine should be shut down, acknowledging its role in the region's economy.\n\nHowever, they claim the current operating rate is not sustainable for the health of their own interests.\n\nLawyer Oliver Gayner says the class action may end up being a test case for regulators. (ABC Central West: Micaela Hambrett)\n\nMr Gayner said the case was unusual because it was being bought by people with similarly valuable assets to protect.\n\n\"What's unusual is the close juxtaposition of a mine within an [organised and determined] community, with farmland and residential properties which are high value,\" he said.\n\n\"These people want to protect their interests now and for the future.\"\n\nCourt history\n\nIn 2023, Newmont pleaded guilty in the Land and Environment Court to three counts of air pollution and was fined $350,000.\n\nTwo additional charges were dropped in exchange for the mine installing five new dust monitors in 2024.\n\nThat same year, farmers on the mine's southern border reported slabs of white foam appearing on the Belubula River, an important source of irrigation for the region.\n\nFoam was recorded in the Belubula River in July 2024. (Supplied: Cadia Community Sustainability Network)\n\nLaboratory tests revealed the foam was predominantly PFOS, a synthetic chemical used in a variety of industrial applications, including firefighting.\n\nA year-long sampling program by the Environment Protection Authority established PFAS was present in the Upper Belubula River catchment at 16 sites, including the Blayney tip, landscape supplier ANL and Cadia, but the risk was low for livestock and the environment.\n\nThe EPA later banned fishing in the Belubula and erected warning signs after testing revealed the flesh of some fish species contained 40 times the daily intake limit for PFOS.\n\nA hearing has been directed for March.",

(Supplied: Infrastructure NSW)\n\nMr Oppedisano said the company had not had alternative locations proposed by the state government.\n\nBrad Hosemans from Polaris Marine, a maintenance contractor for Transport for NSW, wrote a submission during the Bays station consultation process in which he said there was no other site on the harbour that would allow the company to continue at the same scale.\n\n\"That is because no such site exists,\" he said.\n\n\"The combination of deep-water access, industrial zoning, sufficient land area, and continuous navigational access does not exist elsewhere in the harbour.\"\n\nMr Hosemans rejected the idea of moving to Port Botany or Port Kembla, south of Wollongong, as it would make the day-to-day maintenance of harbour assets untenable.\n\nCabinet review of port ongoing\n\nDespite the planning department website stating the Bays West TOD rezoning plan would be publicly available in 2025, they have not been published.\n\nBays West is one of eight TOD precincts in Sydney and is the only one that does not have a finalisation report exhibited.\n\nThe website states that the Bays West TOD rezoning will track on a different timeline due to the need to \"resolve working harbour and ports uses\".\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Planning, Housing and Infrastructure said the rezoning proposal was subject to a review led by the Cabinet Office.\n\nThe review is examining the potential of housing coexisting with the working port, according to a 2025 Transport for NSW report.\n\n\"The review has involved extensive consultation with stakeholders, including leaseholders operating out of the precinct,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"No decision has been made on the future of the precinct. The NSW government will have more to say once it has considered the findings of the review.\"\n\nThe precinct includes parts of the working harbour at Glebe Island in White Bay, which handles large amounts of the state's cement, sugar, salt and gypsum.",

        "text": "An Amsterdam-based band is bringing its psychedelic take on traditional Indonesian music to Australia for the first time in March.\n\nNusantara Beat topped the Transglobal World Music Chart in January and is scheduled to play in South Australia at world music, art and dance festival WOMADelaide.\n\nAll members of the Dutch band have Indonesian ancestry, and guitarist Jordy Sanger said they decided to dive into their roots through music.\n\n30 years of Womadelaide for a tree Womadelaide has grown in 30 years from small beginnings in Adelaide's Botanic Park, but so too have the trees its musical notes have bounced about.\n\n\"Psychedelic music, for me, is where your thoughts float away, not being afraid of making bold choices in a sonic way, trying to connect different harmonic realms, like a trip,\" Sanger said.\n\n\"And indeed, it's so much fun to combine that with traditional Indonesian music and instruments.\n\n\" The traditional instruments can make the music sound very dangerous \u2026 we love that. \"\n\nSanger said everyone in the six-piece band had sought to discover their ancestry.\n\nJordy Sanger says it felt \"unreal\" to hit number one on the Transglobal World Music Chart. (Instagram: @nusantara_beat)\n\n\"When I was a kid and living in the east of the Netherlands, all my friends were white; I was the only brown kid at school,\" Sanger said.\n\n\"So when I looked in the mirror, I always saw something different compared with my local environment and that was fine. I experienced it as something rather neutral.\n\n\"But when I grew older, I became more curious about my roots and ancestry, especially in my late 20s.\"\n\nLive music is integral to Indonesian culture \u2014 in traditional music settings, but also in guitar-based rock'n'roll that is exceptionally popular among locals.\n\n\"Live music runs in their veins,\" Sanger said.\n\n\"In the Netherlands, almost every Indonesian-descended person I know, knows how to play guitar.\"\n\nHe said it felt very \"exciting to discover 60s and 70s Indonesian pop music\".\n\nNusantara Beat is fronted by vocalist Megan de Klerk. (Instagram: @nusantara_beat)\n\n\"Although I don't understand all the words immediately, the music and the words do resonate with me,\" he said.\n\nSanger also studied the compositional aspect of Indonesian music.\n\nThis included the scales and harmony used in traditional Indonesian music and Sunda pop [Sundanese popular music].\n\nIn what he described as a generally unplanned approach, the band acquired some traditional instruments like gamelan gangsa (metallophones), kecapi, kendang, ceng-cengs and gongs.\n\n\"The gangsa and gongs were sampled and loaded into samplers,\" he said.\n\n\"The kecapi was played by Rouzy [Portier]. It's a sitar-ish instrument. Kendang is a drum from Java or Bali.\n\n\"Ceng-cengs are thick, brass cymbals you hit against each other and, together with the gongs, they were played by Gino [Groeneveld], our percussionist.\"\n\nThe result is a highly rhythmic sound, a mix of western electric guitar licks and Indonesian folk, and fun, playful grooves.\n\nTopping global chart\n\nNusantara Beat in January hit number one on the Transglobal World Music Chart, which is ranked by an international panel of music critics.\n\nIt makes its choices based on merit rather than popularity, big productions or record sales, and disbands with geographical barriers.\n\nSanger said it felt a bit \"unreal\" for a band that did not follow the charts.\n\n\"But when we actually looked at the chart and saw the other artists on it, it felt very special,\" he said.\n\n\" For us, it mostly feel like encouragement, something like, 'OK, this strange mix of Indonesian roots and psych folk actually connects with people far outside of our own bubble. \"\n\nThey have also built a following in Indonesia.\n\n\"On Instagram, about 70 per cent of our following is from Indonesia,\" Sanger said.\n\n\"We've been touring in Indonesia twice. We haven't played a show in Bali \u2014 yet, please invite us.\"\n\nSanger also met Indonesian family for the first time while touring there in 2024.\n\n\"That was mental. It felt like I'd known them for my whole life,\" he said.\n\n\"The immediate warmth is, for me, very special.\"\n\nNusantara Beat will play two sets at WOMADelaide.\n\nSanger said audiences could expect to hear \"Indonesian psych folk tunes served with good vibes and quite possibly jetlag\".",

(ABC Radio Sydney: Declan Bowring)\n\nFormer ABC Radio Sydney manager Peter Wall, who hired Valentine in the early 1990s, said he could tell he was a natural in the studio from his first shift.\n\n\"When you listen to the first hour, you punch the air and you know that you're happy with what you got \u2014 that's what I did with him,\" he said.\n\nWhat separated Valentine from his peers was the \"looseness\" he projected on the airwaves.\n\n\"Some of those people just have this thing which breaks through. They manage to stay themselves, notwithstanding the pressures on them \u2026 he was one of those special people on radio.\"\n\nABC managing director Hugh Marks described Valentine as \"one of the great creative forces in Australian broadcasting\".\n\n\"He has an extraordinary gift for turning everyday moments into joyful, smart and surprising radio, and the connection he has built with his audience over decades simply cannot be overstated,\" he said.\n\n\"We're proud to celebrate everything he has brought to the ABC, and we wish him strength and support as he focuses on his health.\"\n\nListeners will have a chance to enjoy Valentine's most memorable moments with a special retrospective that will air on Friday, showcasing the best of Valentine's past programs.\n\nCallers thank Valentine for bringing joy to dull days\n\nHundreds of listeners flooded the text line, thanking Valentine for his work over the years and wishing him well as he dealt with cancer.\n\nIn March 2024, Valentine announced his initial diagnosis of oesophageal cancer and took a leave of absence to receive treatment.\n\nValentine returned to the program later that year, hosting Afternoons until June 2025, when the new tumours were discovered.\n\nJames Valentine, who is a talented jazz musician, is also stepping away from his ABC Jazz program Upbeat. (Supplied: James Valentine)\n\nLong-time listener Jacqueline said she was gutted Valentine was not returning.\n\n\"James Valentine turned me into a serial pest. I just couldn't resist his segments. He's kept me company through parental leave, through boring days during lockdown when I was living alone. I'm so sorry to hear he's not coming back. He's brought so much joy to all of us.\"\n\nListeners praised his welcoming, warm and kind style.\n\n\"No affectation, no feigned tolerance, it was legit,\" Sarah said.\n\nMany were fans of Valentine's This is What I Live With talkback segment, which allowed people to vent about their partner's foibles.\n\nTony described him as a free marriage counsellor while Louise credited the segment with helping keep couples together.\n\n\"I think it's probably helped normalise some of the madness of our pairings \u2026 sometimes it's those little quirky things that really irritate people more than important things,\" he said.\n\nValentine could also handle serious events, with Jill praising his coverage of the shootings at a Christchurch mosque in 2019.\n\n\"He was rightly shocked and horrified, but equally full of compassion and full of empathy. It was just a time where I felt we really need that, and I really will miss him in the afternoon,\" she said.\n\nJames O'Loghlin is filling in as host of Afternoons, but a permanent replacement has yet to be announced.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nA key section of Brisbane\u2019s Riverwalk has reopened, marking a milestone for the city and the revitalisation of the flood-prone CBD stretch. With the backdrop of the Story Bridge, the ribbon was cut on Tuesday by Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner and representatives of Dexus to officially open the Riverwalk following a three-year, $42 million transformation. The 256-metre stretch from Charlotte Street to Alice Street creates a continuous walking and cycling route from the Story Bridge at Howard Smith Wharves to the Botanic Gardens. Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner was among the group officially reopening the Riverwalk on Tuesday. Brittney Deguara \u201cYou couldn\u2019t imagine Brisbane without the Riverwalk, just like you couldn\u2019t imagine Brisbane without the CityCats and the Story Bridge,\u201d Schrinner said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the council contributed $22 million to the project to upgrade it from a narrow section of path to the wide, flood-resilient promenade, but the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d came from Dexus. \u201cThis is the section that I have no doubt tourists in 2032 will be flocking to as this whole precinct is activated. This is about making sure that Brisbane embraces its river,\u201d Schrinner said. He said ratepayers were getting \u201cbang for their buck\u201d through the funding partnership with Dexus, and that paying for the project in full would have cost the council tens of millions of dollars. The section has been fenced off since 2023, while work was done at the multibillion-dollar Waterfront Brisbane site, which will boast retail tenancies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe entire project was scheduled to open in 2027, but was delayed last year owing to construction complexities and bad weather. \u201cFor [Dexus] to keep ploughing ahead and delivering this great outcome against the odds is a fantastic outcome,\u201d Schrinner said. Schrinner walking the new path with Dexus chief executive Ross Du Vernet and project director for Waterfront Brisbane Matthew Beasley. Brittney Deguara \u201cI\u2019m more interested in what it does for the community rather than whether there [were] a few delays suffered. \u201cFor generations to come, people will forget about the extra few months it took, and they\u2019ll remember the great outcome that\u2019s been delivered.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocals Wayne and Cathy Jeffries were among the first pedestrians to walk along the new path. \u201cI think after the floods they had to do something to bring it back, and looking forward, we\u2019ve got the Olympic Games coming up, so you\u2019ve got to make it look impressive for all the overseas guests,\u201d Wayne said. Wayne and Cathy Jeffries said they would use the walkway every couple of months when they ventured into the city. Brittney Deguara \u201cIt\u2019s great to see Brisbane progress and the new Kangaroo Point Bridge as well, and lovely new restaurants around the city, Queen\u2019s Wharf ... it is the place to be,\u201d Cathy added. The passage has been rebuilt with new paths and banisters, and three local street artists painted a Brisbane-themed mural at the start of the walkway in three days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great aquatic theme, which is appropriate for a river city and a city based on Moreton Bay,\u201d Schrinner said. Waterfront Brisbane will eventually comprise two new office towers, shops, restaurants and public space. The aquatic-themed mural at Brisbane\u2019s Riverwalk took just three days to complete.

The pair met on Monday night and held what both parties described as constructive talks to reform the Coalition after it blew apart last month over a dispute about shadow cabinet discipline. Opposition Leader Sussan Ley on Tuesday morning. Alex Ellinghausen Ley revealed the offer in a Liberal Party room on Tuesday morning. According to sources in the room, Ley said the offer she made to Littleproud included that the three senators who resigned from the shadow cabinet a fortnight ago after crossing the floor would not be eligible to sit on the frontbench until July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer second demand was that shadow cabinet solidarity be reaffirmed by both parties. The backbench party rooms of both parties would not be able to overturn decisions made by the shadow cabinet, a point that was queried by two conservative MPs who raised concerns about the party room\u2019s right to have its say on party policy. These first two demands were put to Littleproud as non-negotiable by Ley, according to party sources. Opposition leader Sussan Ley addresses the media this morning. Alex Ellinghausen The Nationals expressed frustration that Ley\u2019s offer leaked out to the media before its own MPs were briefed on the offer. Littleproud released a statement at midday saying he would take his time to respond. \u201cAs per media reports, the Nationals have received a written offer from the Liberal Party,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will take our time to consider the details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Nationals are united in our endeavours to reset the Coalition, but we won\u2019t be providing updates on any negotiations through the media.\u201d As secondary requests, the Liberals would also reclaim the shadow assistant treasurer portfolio from the Nationals, with the skills portfolio given back in return. The Liberals covet the assistant treasurer portfolio because it takes in important policy areas such as superannuation. Nationals leader David Littleproud at the traditional pre-parliament church service on Tuesday morning. Alex Ellinghausen The Nationals would be able to pick three other MPs to fill the frontbench spots left by the resignations of Bridget McKenzie, Ross Cadell and Susan McDonald. Pressure has intensified on Littleproud this week as his own MPs backed a motion to get the Coalition back together, weeks after Liberals blamed him for recklessly allowing his party to vote against Labor\u2019s post-Bondi hate speech laws despite the shadow cabinet agreeing to back it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut both Littleproud and Ley have boxed themselves in, with Littleproud taking a hard line on a demand to reinstate the three frontbenchers who resigned last month, which Ley and her party room oppose, and also seeking greater flexibility for Nationals to cross the floor. While announcing the split 12 days ago, Littleproud said that the Nationals \u201ccannot be part of a shadow ministry under Sussan Ley\u201d, so any reconciliation would be a major backdown for the Nationals leader. Many MPs in both parties would like to see the two parties rejoin, even though some Moderate Liberals are keen to remain apart so that the Liberals can focus on city voters. Queensland backbencher Terry Young argued the split should be long-lasting. One Liberal MP said after Ley\u2019s briefing that the Nationals were \u201cparasitic\u201d as the regional party \u201csee the relationship with the Liberal Party as a way to enrich themselves\u201d rather than achieve mutual success. \u201cMany Liberals believe that are an unworthy coalition partner. Until they adopt a new mind set we are better off without them dragging us down to their level of mediocrity,\u201d said the MP, who spoke off the record to be candid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition leader Sussan Ley take their seats for an ecumenical service for the commencement of Parliament at St Paul\u2019s Anglican Church in Canberra. Alex Ellinghausen \u201cDavid Littleproud is no longer credible as a leader and a parliamentarian. He should consider his future,\u201d the MP said. \u201cPreferably a vocation that does not require any form of relationship management.\u201d This masthead reported on Monday that Ley\u2019s allies, battling to stave off a challenge from leadership rival Angus Taylor, were asking MPs to keep Ley in the job until at least the time of the federal budget in May. Speaking outside a church service to mark the opening of parliament on Tuesday, Ley said: \u201cVery confident of delivering a strong budget in reply speech in May.\u201d \u201cLots of work between now and May because we have a big agenda to prosecute,\u201d she said, adding that talks with Littleproud had been positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLittleproud retained his position after facing a failed leadership challenge from rogue Nationals MP Colin Boyce on Monday. The Nationals leader said conversations last night between the two had been \u201cpositive\u201d but did not end in the Coalition re-forming. Nationals MP Darren Chester, who has been pushing Littleproud to soften and reunite with Ley, said on Tuesday that the Liberals could not determine who the Nationals appointed to the frontbench. \u201cI would have thought the leaders of both teams would choose their best performers in their eyes, to be on the shadow ministry, in the shadow cabinet. So that\u2019s really a conversation they need to have behind closed doors,\u201d he said on ABC Radio National. Cut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

Ayres notified the federal parliament on Tuesday that, following a legal change late last year that extended Canadian citizenship eligibility to the grandchildren of people born in the country, he had involuntarily become a dual citizen. Minister for Industry and Innovation Tim Ayres. Alex Ellinghausen The episode revived memories of the federal parliament\u2019s so-called constitutional crisis in 2017. Starting in July that year, a number of senators and members were disqualified from sitting in the federal parliament because they had failed to renounce or were eligible to hold citizenship of a second country, which they had failed to renounce. It eventually led to the disqualification of 15 MPs, including then-deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, now-Greens leader Larissa Waters and the current Finance Minister Katy Gallagher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrior to his election in 2019, Ayres took all possible steps to renounce his Canadian citizenship by descent, but was told at the time by the Canadian government that he had nothing to renounce as he was not eligible for citizenship. Related Article Live\n\nNational News Live Australia news LIVE: RBA interest rate decision today; Cory Bernardi recruited by One Nation as Ley, Littleproud fail to reach Coalition resolution But that changed in June last year when laws were introduced into the Canadian parliament to expand the right to citizenship, automatically, to anyone born to a Canadian parent and, in many cases, grandparent. The Canadian parliament made the changes to its citizenship laws after a 2023 court decision found that the country\u2019s laws, which limited citizenship by descent, were unconstitutional. After the laws to reclaim so-called \u201clost Canadians\u201d were introduced into the nation\u2019s parliament in June 2025, but before they came into effect on December 15 last year, Ayres sought advice from the Canadian government about how to renounce his citizenship, but was told he could not pre-renounce his dual citizenship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAyres also took advice from senior counsel, who told him that he was still eligible to be a senator and minister because \u201cthe implied qualification to s 44(i) of the Australian Constitution recognised by the High Court would prevent a newly enacted foreign law from disqualifying a sitting member of the Australian parliament\u201d. Ayres\u2019 lawyer also advised him to renounce his Canadian citizenship as quickly as possible, which he did. Ayres on December 10 last year, days before he involuntarily became a Canadian citizen. Dominic Lorrimer It was not until Bill C-3, as the law is known, came into effect on December 15 that Ayres could renounce his Canadian citizenship. The very next day, he contacted the Canadian government and was advised that he could finally renounce his citizenship of that country. The process took two weeks, according to a letter dated December 29 from the director-general of the Canadian passport office in Ottawa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat letter states that \u201cthis document confirms that your application to renounce Canadian citizenship that was automatically conferred on you by operation of Canadian citizenship law was approved and you ceased to be a Canadian citizen on December 29, 2025\u201d. \u201cAs this document attests that you ceased to be a Canadian citizen, we suggest that you keep this document in a secure place for future reference.\u201d Ayres became a Canadian citizen because his grandfather was born in Canada in 1910, and was at that time a British subject. His grandfather later moved to Australia, and his father was born in Australia. The law change conferred Canadian citizenship on his father and, retrospectively, on the minister when the law change took effect. Ayres is one of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s most trusted lieutenants and a key powerbroker in the party\u2019s left faction. He told this masthead that while grandfather was born in Canada, he had taken all steps possible to ensure before the 2019 and 2025 elections that he was only an Australian citizen and eligible to sit in parliament.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor's pick Political leadership Ley reveals fresh demand to Littleproud, including benching rebels for six months \u201cIn December 2025, Canada\u2019s Bill C-3 came into effect. As soon as the new Canadian law received Royal Assent, I established as soon as was legally possible that I was solely an Australian citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe advice I have received from constitutional experts is clear: I have always been \u2013 and remain \u2013 eligible to sit in the parliament. I take my constitutional responsibilities seriously and today have made an addendum to my Qualification Checklist confirming that I remain not a Canadian citizen.\u201d Professor Anne Twomey, a constitutional law expert at the University of Sydney, said previous High Court cases related to dual citizenship had not dealt with \u201cthe unusual case of a person being validly elected, but then, against their will, having foreign citizenship conferred upon them, and immediately renouncing it\u201d. \u201cIf this matter came before a court, there would be a good case to argue that it fell within an exception from disqualification, just as an exception also arises where there is an irremediable impediment to renouncing foreign citizenship,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn practical terms, it is unlikely to come before a court, because it could only get there if the Senate referred it. Doing so would have no advantage, other than clarifying the law, because the senator could simply resign and then fill the resulting vacancy, as he is no longer a Canadian citizen.\u201d Cut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

Got it Share A A A\n\nWhy did the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s flagship publication publish at the weekend comments made by Xi Jinping back in 2024? The obvious answer, given that their publication would have had to be made with Xi\u2019s approval, is that he sees an opportunity as the \u201cSell America\u201d trade gains traction. Trump\u2019s chaotic policymaking is causing significant levels of distrust in America and its future. Getty The remarks published in Qiushi magazine focus on the role China\u2019s renminbi can play in global trade and foreign exchange markets, with Xi posing the rhetorical question of \u201cWhat constitutes a strong financial nation?\u201d \u201cFirst, it should have a powerful currency, widely used in international trade, investment and foreign exchange markets, holding the status of a global reserve currency,\u201d he answered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo achieve those objectives, China would need a powerful central bank capable of effective monetary management, globally competitive financial institutions and international financial centres able to attract global capital and exert influence over global pricing, he said. Xi\u2019s ambition of internationalising China\u2019s currency isn\u2019t recent or secret. Related Article Opinion\n\nFederal Reserve Trump\u2019s hand-picked man may not do his bidding Stephen Bartholomeusz Senior business columnist In recent years, it has accelerated its push to have the renminbi used as at least one side of trade transactions and has been doing that increasingly in trade with Russia, Iran, India, the Middle East and South American and African countries. About a third of its bilateral trade is now settled in renminbi. The recent stand-off with BHP, where China refused to allow the company to land some of its iron ore unless the trade was settled in renminbi, was a sign of a new willingness to use strong-arm tactics to coerce counterparties into using its currency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also built the payments infrastructure \u2013 its Cross-Border Interbank Payment System \u2013 to clear and settle international transactions in renminbi, to promote its internationalisation and to reduce reliance on the US dollar and the dominant US-dominated SWIFT financial messaging system. So, why dust off an old speech to articulate a previously largely unspoken but widely recognised ambition? With governance in the US apparently dysfunctional, its traditional allies unsettled and fearful and investors, governments starting to reduce their exposure to treasury markets and an economy whose settings are no longer regarded as risk-free, Xi senses a moment. Bloomberg It\u2019s because the US and the US dollar appear vulnerable. Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic policymaking, the international hostility and distrust generated by his trade war on the rest of the world, his assaults on multinational and domestic institutions, his threats to seize the territory of a NATO ally, his kidnapping of another country\u2019s president, his disdain for the US Constitution and domestic laws, his attack of the Federal Reserve board\u2019s independence, the accelerating build-up of US government debt and a fear that the administration is going to monetise that debt through money-printing and dollar depreciation are causing significant levels of distrust in America and its future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe demonstrated effect of the US-led seizure of Russian foreign exchange reserves at the onset of the war in Ukraine is another reason for foreign governments and their central banks to look for alternatives which, at the moment, appear to be largely a switch from US assets to gold. Central banks have doubled their purchases of gold since the seizure of Russia\u2019s reserves on 2022. In the post-war era, the US dollar and the US Treasury securities market have been regarded as the world\u2019s \u201csafe havens\u201d, but their status has been eroding since Trump first took office in 2017 and has deteriorated in the first year of his second term. It is reflected starkly in a depreciation of the dollar approaching 11 per cent against the basket of America\u2019s major trading partners since Trump\u2019s inauguration last year. Last week, Trump said he welcomed that decline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great. Look at the business we\u2019re doing. The dollar\u2019s doing great,\u201d he said. A weaker dollar makes US exports more competitive abroad. His Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, immediately tried to walk those comments back, saying America remained committed to a strong-dollar policy. \u201cIf we have sound policies, the money will flow in,\u201d he said. That is, of course, a big \u201cif,\u201d given the nature of Trump\u2019s policies to date. Xi\u2019s ambition of internationalising China\u2019s currency isn\u2019t recent or secret. A concern for foreign investors in the US and central banks holding US dollar-denominated reserves is that the chairman of Trump\u2019s council of economic advisers and his temporary appointee as a Fed board governor, Stephen Miran, authored a paper in 2024 which set out how to boost US exports and the US manufacturing sector, narrow its trade deficit and lower the cost of US government debt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe key to the \u201cMar-a-Lago Accord\u201d, as it has become known, is a controlled depreciation of the US dollar. While Miran seems to have envisaged a grand agreement with other countries to intervene in markets to achieve that objective, it\u2019s been happening anyway, in an uncontrolled fashion \u2013 which might explain why Bessent was so quick to try to distance himself and US Treasury policy from Trump\u2019s comments. For Miran\u2019s thesis to work, if it could work, dollar depreciation would have to occur in a measured way over a significant period. The \u201cSell America\u201d trade is gaining traction on markets. AP Igniting an exodus from US markets at a time when US government debt has surpassed $US38 trillion ($54.5 trillion) and is climbing \u2013 and when nearly half that debt will now roll over within two years because Bessent has replaced maturing longer-term bonds with lower interest cost Treasury bills and notes \u2013 would be a potentially destabilising and potentially crisis-inducing exercise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the US governance apparently dysfunctional, its traditional allies unsettled and fearful, investors and governments starting to reduce their exposure to Treasury markets and an economy whose settings are no longer regarded as risk-free, Xi senses a moment. Sensing it is one thing. Taking advantage of America\u2019s moment of vulnerability is another. Related Article Analysis\n\nChina relations The 2027 question: Will Xi Jinping annex Taiwan this soon, or not? While the dollar\u2019s share of foreign exchange transactions, trade and central bank reserves has been sliding, it still remains the dominant currency in global financial activity. It\u2019s used in about 89 per cent of foreign-exchange transactions, about 60 per cent of global debt is denominated in dollars and 57 per cent of foreign exchange reserves are dollar-denominated. In contrast, China\u2019s currency is used in fewer than 9 per cent of foreign exchange transactions and constitutes only 1.93 per cent of global reserves. The euro has a stronger position, used in about 29 per cent of FX transactions and is the currency for about 20 per cent of the world\u2019s official reserves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo ever challenge the dollar as a reserve currency, China would need to make very significant changes to its policy settings, changes that would probably be unpalatable to the Communist Party. A reserve currency needs to be completely freely traded, which requires an open capital account and a freely floating currency whose value is determined by the market. China has tight capital controls \u2013 cross-border transactions have to be approved by a government agency \u2013 and manages its exchange rate tightly to ensure its stability. Related Article Opinion\n\nTrump's White House Trump is pushing China and Europe together to create a new world order Xi isn\u2019t going to relinquish control over his financial system so, even without the other features needed to achieve reserve currency status \u2013 transparent and trusted legal and judicial systems and deep and very liquid financial markets \u2013 his ambitions are unlikely to be realised within the forseeable future. China, and Europe, can, however, keep chipping away at the dollar\u2019s dominance and the effective subsidies of borrowing costs and the US standard of living that the rest of the world provides America, if only to reduce their own vulnerabilities to the Trump-driven shifts in America\u2019s relationship with the rest of the world.

Share A A A\n\nI\u2019m five minutes early to meet celebrated writer Kathy Lette at Crafted, the restaurant at the Art Gallery of NSW \u2013 and I\u2019m feeling a little nervous. The previous evening, I\u2019d watched her Australian Story profile \u2013 it ends with footage of a recent launch of one of her books, where she invites everyone to come up on stage and dance. She\u2019s also famous for serving up a \u201cDisco Diet\u201d at her many London dinner parties, with participants bopping for hours after dessert. Would this lunch go the same way? As a founding member of Inhibited Anonymous \u2013 and the last person to join a Gloria Gaynor flashmob \u2013 I sincerely hope not. Suddenly, Lette arrives, dressed in a trademark brightly patterned frock with matching lipstick and a pair of stilettos. She has chosen the restaurant because the gallery is currently showing an exhibition of Australian women artists, which is firmly in her wheelhouse. I\u2019m conscious she is going to visit her 91-year-old mother that afternoon, so we quickly peruse the menus and order what I call a \u201cStandard Girl Lunch\u201d \u2013 vegetables, fish and mineral water. Lette orders bottarga with crudite vegetables. The beetroot salad is calling me and we both order the barramundi. Kathy Lette says her mantra for her musician husband Brian O\u2019Doherty is \u201cthat he adores me, doesn\u2019t bore me, and does all my chores for me\u201d. Photo: Sam Mooy I clearly radiate AA vibes as none of my lunchers ever orders a drink. Of course, eliciting personal secrets from interview subjects by getting them tipsy is a well-worn journalistic technique, but it turns out that here, it\u2019s redundant. The 67-year-old author is quite capable of telling you her most intimate life stories \u2013 over a glass of water. Lette has been famous since 1979, when a book she co-wrote with the late Gabrielle Carey rocketed onto the Australian literary scene. Puberty Blues, about two very young women growing up in a surfer community in Cronulla, became a cause celebre for its graphic portrayals of underage sex and drug-taking, including heroin. Two years after publication, it was made into a movie directed by Bruce Beresford. Lette in 2021 at Elouera Beach, Cronulla, where the Puberty Blues movie based on her book was set. Photos: Louise Kennerley, Supplied\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHerald journalist Helen Pitt wrote about the movie on its 40th anniversary in 2021, saying it \u201cwas criticised for whitewashing the feminist themes of the book, in relation to rape, abortion and miscarriage ... The original movie shows a culture in which gang rape is incidental and unremarkable, and mindless violence is amusing. And yet it serves as a valuable timepiece\u201d. I asked Lette, who grew up in Cronulla, how many of her 21 books were based on her own life. All of them, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper than therapy \u2013 putting it on the page is a way of making sense of the drama. I\u2019ve written about everything: being a single girl around town in Sydney, trying to find a man who wasn\u2019t married or gay, moving to LA. I\u2019ve written about pregnancy, motherhood, raising a teenage daughter, raising an autistic son. I\u2019ve written about divorce, I\u2019ve written about affairs, I\u2019ve written about midlife trauma, and now I\u2019m writing about women post-menopause, because I think that\u2019s the most interesting time in a woman\u2019s life.\u201d The barramundi and spring vegetables. Kathy Lette\u2019s order of bottarga with crudite vegetables. The heirloom beetroot salad with whipped sunflower seed, mustard greens and pieces of orange. Photos: Sam Mooy\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA woman\u2019s 60s are liberating, she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the marriages, the divorces, we\u2019ve raised the children. We\u2019ve had the betrayals, the affairs, the heartbreak, the backstabs, all of that and the financial ups and downs. That material is so rich. And women survive it with such a good sense of humour,\u201d she says. Lette says hormones are key to women\u2019s lives, joking that she\u2019s book-ended her writing career with tomes about puberty and menopause. \u201cI think women don\u2019t come into their true selves till post-menopause, because women are brought up to be decorative and demure. But then after the menopause, when your estrogen drops, we no longer care what people think about us,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so I just find women this age fabulous, funny, fascinating. I\u2019m trying to encourage women my age to go forth and be fabulous because if not now, when?\u201d The author is a generous interviewee, talking in long sentences that give me time to eat my heirloom beetroot salad, which has whipped sunflower seed, mustard greens and pieces of orange, and is absolutely scrumptious. She doesn\u2019t have time to touch her entree of whipped cod roe, bottarga and crudites and asks to take it home to give to her partner, Irish-born musician Brian O\u2019Doherty, whom she describes as a \u201cbrilliant cook\u201d. We have both ordered the barramundi, which is on the menu as a special. It comes out as a thick wedge of beautifully tender fish topped with a crisp rectangle of skin, surrounded by a melange of mirepoix spring vegetables and crunchy seeds. For the thousandth time, I wonder why my own amateur kitchen offerings cannot achieve this perfect balance of textures and flavours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a few mouthfuls, we return to a perennial topic \u2013 when are our unmarried offspring going to give us some grandchildren? Lette reveals that she has given her daughter a gift of egg freezing for her next birthday. She has written about it (with her daughter\u2019s permission) for a British newspaper. The bill from Crafted, the restaurant at the Art Gallery of NSW. \u201cI used to think women could have it all. I still think women can have it all, but it\u2019s not all at once,\u201d she says. Lette says that when she gives talks in schools, she tells the young women to choose their partner carefully. \u201cBecause if you choose an alpha male, he\u2019s going to have a big career. If the child is sick, who do you think is the one who has to pull back? Yeah, it\u2019s always the woman,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had two alpha men, whom I adore [her former husbands ABC chair Kim Williams and London barrister Geoffrey Robertson, KC]. I still love them both, and I\u2019m very close to them. Right now, I\u2019ve got a beta. My mantra for him is that he adores me, doesn\u2019t bore me, and does all my chores for me. And it\u2019s incredible to have a beta man, and he wants me to be shining, and I earn more money, right? That\u2019s OK.\u201d I\u2019ve cyberstalked Lette\u2019s social media, finding photos of her going on holidays with Robertson and the children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGeoffrey\u2019s and my divorce was pretty amicable. We\u2019ve got two kids, one who has special needs [their 35-year-old son, Julius, is on the autism spectrum] so we\u2019ve got to stay friends,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I always say to my girlfriends, \u2018there was something about that person you loved and it is still there\u2019. Once you get over the pain and the wrangling, you can find that in that person again and try and concentrate on that. So especially if you\u2019ve got kids, it makes it much easier.\u201d Lette lives between a house in London and a light-filled apartment in Sydney\u2019s inner east. Being an Australian means you can escape the worst aspects of the British class system, she says. Rubbing royal shoulders: Prince Charles (now the King) greets Kathy Lette at a reception to mark Camilla\u2019s 70th birthday at Clarence House in 2017. Photo: Getty Images I ask her about her well-known friendship with the King and Queen. \u201cWhen I\u2019m with a member of the royal family and I say something cheeky, there\u2019s an audible gasp from the minders \u2013 \u2018did she really say that to the King?\u2019 But he always finds it funny and so does Camilla. I mean, I always say to them, \u2018I really like you, even though I don\u2019t believe in you.\u2019 I am a republican.\u201d How do they take that? I ask. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty sanguine,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, look what they\u2019ve been through.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Share A A A\n\nIt\u2019s been seven years since The Economist boldly declared 2019 \u201cthe year of the vegan\u201d, and it appears the vegan revolution is running out of steam, with some joking on social media that life has just become too depressing to swear off meat. Signs of veganism\u2019s decline first appeared back in 2023 when a YouGov survey found that just 6 per cent of Australians follow a vegan or vegetarian diet. For many industry experts, the collapse in the vegan boom has been a long time coming. It appears the vegan revolution is running out of steam. Getty Images \u201cI told investment companies 10 years ago that veganism is a niche of a niche,\u201d says Ged Futter, a retail expert and former buyer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Diet What\u2019s for dinner? The debate over fresh, frozen or canned veg \u201cIt was no surprise to me at all. Veganism sits within vegetarianism and no one really talks about vegetarianism any more.\u201d The current state of affairs is a far cry from five years ago, when shoppers could hardly move for vegan ad campaigns. Woolworths, Coles and Aldi all unveiled plant-based ranges while KFC, Krispy Kreme and Magnum made similar attempts to cash in on the vegan hype. But many are starting to realise that consumer appetite isn\u2019t there. Last year, Woolworths confirmed to 9News that it had reduced its vegan offering due to a decline in customer interest. Similarly, Coles also told the outlet it had \u201crefined\u201d its vegan range \u201cto better reflect customer demand\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the UK, popular restaurant chain Wagamama axed a string of vegan favourites from menus, including its \u201cVegatsu\u201d curry and its \u201cvegan K-Dogs\u201d. Andy Hornby, the chief executive of the chain\u2019s owner, The Restaurant Group, argued that interest from diners wasn\u2019t high enough to justify continuing the dishes. Marketing for the chain\u2019s most recent menu additions makes noticeably less of a fuss about its vegan credentials. \u201cPeople are realising that the volumes going through fully vegan products are very low,\u201d says Futter. \u201cFor manufacturers, when volumes are that small and you can\u2019t see a long-term future, there comes a point where you decide to do something else.\u201d Last year was also a reckoning for businesses that sought to dominate the vegan market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Fitness The goal posts for a longer, healthier life are closer than you think In April, Neat Burger, the vegan burger chain backed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Lewis Hamilton, shut all of its UK restaurants after suffering substantial losses. Vegan specialities have also vanished from menus across Europe. The McDonald\u2019s plant burger was quietly pulled from Austrian Branches in July while Domino\u2019s shrank its vegan offering as part of a November relaunch. Meat-free menus are only a cost-saver for restaurants if vegan dishes sell, says Grace Withers, of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) \u2013 but consumer appetite has been overestimated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven when veganism was at its most popular, we saw far more people claiming to be vegan than actually managing to stick to it,\u201d says Withers. \u201cPeople often lapsed when they were hungry and wanted something tasty. We saw this during Veganuary as well.\u201d Only 1 per cent of those who signed up for Veganuary made it to the end of the month having stuck to the diet, according to the AHDB, a public body which supports farmers and growers. Cost has also been a factor, as plant-based substitutes such as Quorn and tofu have increased in price more than cheaper meats in recent years. \u201cConsumers are very price-driven because of the cost-of-living crisis,\u201d says Withers. \u201cMeat-free products are more expensive than pig meat and chicken, so they are not competing on price.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Opinion\n\nNutrition RFK\u2019s new food pyramid is all sizzle and no steak Sarah Berry Lifestyle Health Editor Compounding vegan woes is the fact that some health-conscious consumers have moved on to other fads. \u201cAs the trend for strength training continues to grow in popularity, protein intake has become more of a priority,\u201d says Jenni Tardiff, a trainer at the Gym Group. Data from retail analyst Kantar show that 46 per cent of shoppers try to include high-protein in their diets, up from 38 per cent in 2022. Cultural headwinds have similarly shifted, particularly since Donald Trump re-entered the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe food pyramid unveiled by his health department earlier this month put dairy and healthy fats at the top. \u201cWe are seeing culture swing back towards celebrating real, simple food: red meat, butter and full-fat milk,\u201d says Bia Bezamat, of Kantar. \u201cProtein is easier to get from animal sources. Simplicity is resonating with people in a world that feels increasingly multi-layered and complex.\u201d The rise of weight-loss drugs has also been a factor, Bezamat says: \u201cWhen you are on medication, you need to make sure you eat the nutrients you need and a diet as restrictive as veganism does not really support that.\u201d Elsewhere, a growing pushback against so-called \u201cultra-processed foods\u201d has dented the popularity of meat-free substitutes. \u201cWhen you look at the back of the pack on some vegan products, the list of ingredients is enormous,\u201d says Futter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA large proportion of vegan products are made from things people don\u2019t really recognise or understand. Brands and supermarkets have recognised that this is not what customers are looking for.\u201d Despite the cut-through of the odd vegan product like oat milk, the hope of a wholesale vegan revolution has unravelled. \u201cI think there was an overestimation of how popular veganism would be,\u201d says Bezamat, who compares it to the rise and fall of gluten-free diets. \u201cThat was the original restrictive diet, where there was initially very little offer and then suddenly lots of products,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it just sits there on the shelf.\u201d The Telegraph, London\n\nSave You have reached your maximum number of saved items.

Got it Share A A A\n\nIt is almost common knowledge these days that a capital gain is taxed in the financial year that the contract is signed, not the year of settlement, and getting this wrong can result in double taxation of the same capital gain. Edward Sunna\u2019s case, ruled on by the Federal Court at the end of last year, highlights the danger of declaring the capital gain in the wrong year as you could end up being taxed in both years. Take careful note of the date you sign your sale contract, as it could be what saves \u2013 or costs \u2013 you thousands in tax. Suzanne White This is because the ATO has an unlimited time period to amend old tax returns to include a capital gain, but if the amendment period (usually 2 years) has passed, they cannot remove the capital gain from the incorrect year. In some scenarios, it is not so common knowledge as to which year applies. In Sunna\u2019s case, he signed the contract on June 28, 2019, but did not receive the deposit \u2013 which was nearly 50 per cent of the sale price \u2013 until after June 30, now in the 2019-2020 financial year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe then included the deposit in his 2020 tax return and when the sale of the $5.5 million Sydney unit went through in August 2022, he included the rest of the gain in his 2023 tax return. In reality, the whole of the gain should have been included in the 2019 tax return. So if you\u2019re planning on buying or selling a house soon, here\u2019s what you need to know: Sale of Asset: The capital gain goes in the tax return for the year that the contract was signed, regardless of when the deposit was received. If no contract was signed, then the year that the ownership of the asset transferred. As you can see, this can result in the deadline for lodging tax returns expiring before the outcome is known. You can lodge your tax return without the capital gai,n while the outcome remains uncertain, then amend within a month of settlement. The ATO undertakes not to charge interest or penalties providing the amendment is made within a reasonable time, generally a month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOptions: If you enter into an option to sell your property and the option is exercised, the option proceeds are just included with the sale proceeds in the financial year that the option is exercised \u2013 i.e., the year that the contract for an actual sale is signed. Editor's pick Opinion\n\nProperty development Knocking down and rebuilding? Don\u2019t fall for these tax traps If the option is not exercised, then you need to include the option proceeds in the tax return for the year, back at the start, when the option was entered into. Forfeited Deposit: This goes into the tax return for the year that the deposit was forfeited. Note if the deposit is not forfeited, it just becomes part of the sale proceeds, so it applies to the tax return when the contract was signed. Section 107 of the Income Tax Assessment Act prevents the two-year amendment period limitation applying when an amendment is made to include a capital gain that has not been previously been included in the tax return for that year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe catch is that there is no similar provision to extend the amendment period to correct a capital gain incorrectly included in another year. So, the ATO can go back as far as it likes to include your capital gain in the correct year without having to remove it from the tax return for the year in which it was mistakenly included. This will result in the capital gain being taxed twice. Sunna\u2019s case found that there was no real impediment to this happening. If this article has raised any concerns, you can apply to the ATO to exercise their discretion to allow the amendment period to be extended on the tax return where the capital gain was incorrectly included.

        "text": "Deaths linked to a notorious party drug have surged tenfold in Australia, a study has found, as a prominent hospital warns overdose presentations are on the rise.\n\nGamma-hydroxybutyrate, also known as GHB and \"liquid ecstasy\" is used for its euphoric and disinhibiting effects at low doses.\n\nBut the clear, liquid substance is notorious for the razor-thin margin between the amount required for a positive experience and an overdose.\n\nA study has found the number of GHB-related deaths in Australia has increased tenfold since 2013, while the number of hospitalisations has tripled.\n\nThe study, led by the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre (NDARC) at the University of New South Wales, analysed coronial records, hospital data, treatment services, population surveys and interviews with drug users.\n\nIt found there was a statistically significant increase in GHB-related deaths from 0.02 per 100,000 people in 2013 to 0.24 per 100,000 people in 2022.\n\n'These number are a cause for alarm'\n\nResearchers found GHB-related hospitalisations increased from 5.3 to 19.1 cases per 100,000 people, while treatment episodes increased tenfold, straining hospital and ambulance resources.\n\n\"GHB is a drug that carries quite a high risk of overdose and other harms,\" senior author of the study, NDARC deputy director Amy Peacock, told AAP.\n\n\"Those harms are rising and they are preventable.\"\n\n\"These numbers are a cause for alarm. Without targeted action, the situation will only worsen, and more people will be harmed,\" she warned.\n\nSt Vincent's Hospital Melbourne's emergency medicine director, Dr Jonathan Karro, said GHB-related presentations at the emergency department had spiked in recent years.\n\n\"It's now a daily occurrence,\" Karro told AAP.\n\n\"The spread of patients is much wider now too, with patients of all ages and backgrounds presenting at odd times.\"\n\nKarro said the substance poses unique challenges to clinicians because there is no antidote and patients are often unconscious.\n\nCall for better health messaging\n\nUsers are increasingly purchasing the substance by the litre, given its affordability at about $5 per dose, he added.\n\nAlthough overall use remains low, national survey data suggests the share of Australians who have used it in the past year tripled over the decade.\n\nPeacock called for urgent improvements in health messaging related to GHB, focusing on the risks posed by repeat dosing and drug mixing.\n\n\"Repeated dosing can quickly lead to overdose because GHB builds up in the body faster than people realise,\" Dr Peacock said.\n\n\"And using it with alcohol, ketamine, or other depressants greatly increases the risk of respiratory depression and loss of consciousness.\"\n\nIllegal imports on the rise\n\nThe study suggested increasing availability was behind the spike in GHB-related hospitalisations, with illegal imports on the rise.\n\nIn May, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) warned of a \"tidal wave\" of illegal importation of 1,4-Butanediol, the precursor to GHB.\n\nThe AFP seized more than 18.3 tonnes of the substance in the 12 months leading to March, more than any other drug.\n\nREAD MORE How an offer to carry a strange package to Australia almost turned Susi into a drug courier\n\n\"Our message to the community remains clear \u2014 there is no safe dose of this drug,\" AFP acting assistant commissioner Paula Hudson said at the time.\n\n\"By importing this substance into Australia, criminal networks are creating a demand and appetite for this illicit drug and the bigger the appetite, the bigger the profits.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "The Reserve Bank of Australia's first board meeting of the year could deliver a rate hike \u2014 though some economists say there's a case to hold.\n\nAll of Australia's 'big four' banks, as well as economists from major investment banks and consultancy firms, are forecasting a hike when the RBA's monetary policy board meets on Tuesday.\n\nIf they are right, the RBA would become the first major central bank to reverse course from a series of rate cuts as inflation eased following a surge between mid-2020 and late 2022 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSally Tindall, data insights director at financial comparison site Canstar, said a 0.25 percentage point increase in the cash rate to 3.85 per cent would all but wipe out home loan rates below 5 per cent.\n\n\"There are now just six lenders offering fixed rates under five per cent,\" Tindall said.\n\n\"A February hike would almost certainly close the door on the last remaining options.\"\n\nHowever, some believe the board may opt to keep the cash rate at its current level.\n\nOn the Money podcast: Property values accelerate ahead of RBA meeting Property values accelerate ahead of RBA meeting & gold and silver prices smashed SBS News 20:05 English\n\nWhy some economists expect the RBA to hold\n\nAMP chief economist Shane Oliver expected the RBA to leave the cash rate unchanged, but he said a hike would likely follow soon after if inflation doesn't continue to ease.\n\nHe said that, if the board does not move today, an increase by March remains a strong possibility.\n\n\"Our initial reaction after the CPI was that they'll hike,\" Oliver said, referencing the Australian Bureau of Statistics' (ABS) latest release of consumer price index data last week.\n\n\"But then when we looked a bit more at the data, we thought it was a lot more complicated.\"\n\nCanstar's 'big four bank' forecast data shows broad agreement on a near-term hike, but less clarity on how far rates may rise through 2026. Source: SBS News\n\nOliver acknowledged that, across most measures, inflation remained above the RBA's 2-3 per cent target band and the labour market was still tight, with unemployment at 4.1 per cent.\n\nHowever, he said recent data suggested inflation momentum was easing.\n\n\"The monthly trimmed mean inflation rate (which strips out volatile items) has progressively fallen from a high in October \u2026 to 0.23 per cent in December,\" Oliver said.\n\n\"I don't think you can totally ignore that.\"\n\nHe also pointed to slower growth in rents and new dwelling prices in December, a stronger Australian dollar reducing imported inflation, and business surveys showing output price inflation closer to the RBA's target band.\n\n\"When you run through all of that, I think it's a close call,\" he said.\n\n\"We put [the odds] at 51 hold and 49 hike.\"\n\nA hike is not guaranteed, Westpac chief economist Luci Ellis said.\n\nWhile the former RBA assistant governor expected the central bank to raise rates, there is a chance the board could wait a little bit longer.\n\nThere is a case to be made that data shows inflation is not moving further away from target and there are also arguments to be cautious given the ABS' new monthly measure has made inflation harder to interpret, she said.\n\nBut HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham said the case to hike is a strong one.\n\n\"By not having hiked as much, and not having delivered as big a downturn, it seems the RBA should have held its cash rate higher for a bit longer,\" he said in a research note.\n\nFinancial markets are pricing in roughly a 70 per cent chance of a 0.25 percentage point increase.\n\nWhat a rate hike could cost borrowers\n\nFor borrowers with variable-rate mortgages, the consequences of a rate hike would likely be immediate.\n\nCanstar analysis shows that a 0.25 per cent increase would lift minimum monthly repayments across a wide range of mortgage sizes, increasing pressure on household budgets already strained by elevated living costs.\n\nAn owner-occupier with a $600,000 mortgage and 25 years remaining would see their minimum monthly repayments rise by $90, assuming banks pass it on to their variable customers. Source: SBS News\n\nTindall said the impact would depend on how borrowers responded to last year's rate cuts.\n\n\"In 2025, we saw three cash rate cuts, and a number of variable borrowers didn't actually lower their minimum monthly repayments,\" she said.\n\n\"That meant they were paying more than required and building an important buffer.\"\n\nHowever, she acknowledged that many had reduced repayments out of necessity as grocery, fuel and essential costs rose.\n\n\"For those families, the pressure has intensified,\" Tindall said, warning that further increases could push some households into repayment stress.\n\nShe said Canstar's big four bank forecast data showed broad agreement on a near-term hike, but less clarity on how far rates might rise through 2026.\n\nCanstar modelling also shows how higher rates would reduce borrowing capacity for new buyers, while loan-size analysis highlights how repayment pressure escalates quickly for larger mortgages.\n\nCanstar modelling shows how higher rates would reduce borrowing capacity for new buyers.\n\n\"Prepare your budget as if we're going to see more than one rate hike,\" Tindall said.\n\n\"It's better to be overprepared than fall short.\"\n\nSpending risks and housing pressures\n\nOliver said the RBA would also be weighing how quickly higher rates could hit consumer spending.\n\nA pickup in household consumption late last year was partly driven by the three rate cuts in 2025 and expectations that more relief was coming, he said.\n\n\"There is a danger here that if we now move into rate hikes, we could see a setback in consumer spending,\" Oliver said.\n\nBeyond household budgets, the decision also carries broader consequences for housing.\n\nHousing Industry Association chief economist Tim Reardon said higher rates risk worsening housing inflation by constraining new supply, adding that, while not the only factor, housing costs remained the most persistent driver of inflation.\n\n\"We are seeing house prices rise due to a scarcity of housing,\" he said. \"Higher interest rates exacerbate that scarcity and make the problem worse.\"\n\nHe said the burden of higher rates would fall disproportionately on first home buyers and renters, the latter of which would feel the pain as landlords passed on higher repayment costs to their tenants.\n\n\"Raising rates to slow rental and home price growth is perverse,\" he said. \"It adds to supply shortages and inflationary pressure over the long run.\"\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "Billionaires and delivery giants were among the donors who bet big on politics ahead of the 2025 election.\n\nOn Monday, the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) released its annual financial disclosure return information, revealing the biggest donors and spenders in 2024-25.\n\nIt shows Clive Palmer's mining company, Mineralogy, was the biggest donor, funnelling $52.9 million into his Trumpet of Patriots party and a further $302,901 to his United Australia Party, which was deregistered in 2022.\n\nDespite a publicity campaign that featured a plethora of texts and advertisements, the right-wing political party failed to pick up a lower house seat.\n\nSeveral mining companies spent big in the lead-up to the election, with Coal Australia Limited the second-highest donor.\n\nIt donated $2.7 million to Australians for Prosperity, a coal-industry-funded group campaigning against progressive candidates and a further $1.3 million to an advocacy group promoting the interests of mining communities.\n\nMining magnate Gina Rinehart was the biggest contributor to Advance Australia.\n\nHancock Prospecting, run by Australia's richest person, Gina Rinehart, contributed $895,000 to the conservative lobby group Advance Australia, which focused on disrupting Greens seats.\n\nAnthony Pratt's recycling and packaging empire Pratt Holdings, which owns Visy Industries, donated $2 million to Labor and $1 million to the Liberal Party.\n\nClimate 200, founded by Simon Holmes \u00e0 Court, declared $2,709,200 in donations to third parties, Hothousemag \u2014 a third-party entity that fundraises and spends on political advertising \u2014 and climate action advertising group It's Not a Race.\n\nThat's on top of the $10,875,934 declared to the AEC last year for specific 2025 election donations, which were made directly to independent candidates.\n\nPolitical parties are not required to submit election-specific returns to the AEC, only independent candidates.\n\nTurnbull's son and DoorDash among donors\n\nDelivery giant DoorDash donated $785,000 to the Liberal Party in the four months before the election, compared with $3,000 to Labor. It did not donate in the previous financial year.\n\nDoorDash and fellow delivery outfit Uber Eats vehemently opposed Labor's 2024 Fair Work laws to regulate the gig economy and protect workers. After two years of negotiations with the Transport Workers Union, a landmark minimum pay deal was struck in November.\n\nSBS News has confirmed former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull's son Alex donated $25,000 to independent Wentworth MP Allegra Spender, the same amount as before the 2022 election, as well as $50,000 to Climate200.\n\nOnline gambling company Sportsbet hedged its bets, donating exactly $71,500 to both Labor and the Coalition, with the latter split between the Nationals and Liberals.\n\nCrypto company Coinbase Australia did similarly, spending $100,000 on NSW Labor and $130,000 on the NSW Liberal Party.\n\nMeanwhile, telecommunications giant Optus spent $41,000 on several Labor branches and $42,800 across the Liberals and Nationals.\n\nCoalition outspent Labor in election loss\n\nThe annual snapshot also revealed how much the major parties spent on their 2025 election campaigns.\n\nLabor used $159 million in electoral donations on advertisements and campaign efforts to get Prime Minister Anthony Albanese re-elected, less than the $161 million it received.\n\nMeanwhile, the former Liberal-National Coalition spent $55 million more than Labor, with a total of $214 million across its federal, state and territory divisions.\n\nHowever, it also amassed larger donations, with a total of $221 million in receipts for the financial year.\n\nCommon uses of political donations include fundraising activities, research and polling and campaign material as well as advertising including on television and radio.\n\nAny donation above $16,900 needs to be declared to the AEC, and no foreign entities can donate to Australian parties.\n\nLast February, Labor passed electoral reforms which have reduced the disclosure threshold to $5,000, expedited reporting and introduced new donation caps, which independents claim will benefit the major parties. These come into effect on 1 July 2026.\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by Rania Yallop.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nThe closure of the Afghan embassy in Canberra, in the pipeline for some time, has now been confirmed with a timeline.\n\nThe embassy will officially shut on the 30th of June this year.\n\nThe decision comes after reports late last year that the Australian government advised the embassy's ambassador, Wahidullah Waissi, that his diplomatic credentials would not be renewed.\n\nCEO of the Afghan Women on the Move organisation, Maryam Zahid, says it's a substantial loss for the Afghan diaspora in Australia.\n\n\"This announcement has created a lot of fear, confusion and disappointment. because this embassy for Afghan diaspora here in Australia, it was more than a diplomatic platform, especially for women and elders, it was a place of connection, identity. They could have or they should have worked with Afghan diaspora and ask us what we need and they didn't do that.\"\n\nThe Afghan embassy has served as a diplomatic, cultural and community bridge between Afghan Australians, civil society organisations, schools and universities, plus local, state and federal government.\n\nMs Zahid says the closure leaves a gap the government is yet to explain how it will fill.\n\n\"Because our government here in Australia hasn't offered us something to replace it in terms of having a community platform outside of religious views, community politics, and fights about who is who in the community, that hasn't been given to us, and it hasn't been invested in the Afghan community.\"]]\n\nThe diplomatic mission had been operating as an embassy-in-exile following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.\n\nIt continued to issue official documents such as passports and visas, and to verify IDs for thousands of Afghan citizens living in Australia.\n\nHowever, its services haven't been operating normally since the Taliban announced in July 2024 that it would no longer recognise consular documents issued by 14 embassies related to the former republic, including the Canberra facility.\n\nDirector of the Afghan Cultural Association of Newcastle Sami Zakhil told SBS Pashto for this reason, he doesn't expect the closure to have a significant impact.\n\n\"The embassy has largely operated in a symbolic capacity and, by its own admission, has not been in contact with the current government in Kabul. As a result, it has not been able to meaningfully assist Afghans with consular or official matters.\"\n\nProfessor of Diplomacy at Australian National University, William Maley, says the decision to close the embassy follows a demand from the Taliban that all embassies under the control of an anti-Taliban ambassador be closed.\n\n\"Even though Australia might deny a connection between the letter and the decision, this really dents, if not fatally, Australia's credibility when complaining about the human rights performance of the Taliban. It's a terrible blow not only to the Afghan community, but also to Australian service personnel who served in Afghanistan, they really would feel like the government has spat in their faces.\"\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the government doesn't intend to accept a Taliban-appointed representative in a statement which in part reads:\n\n\"We do not recognise the Taliban as the legitimate representatives of the Afghan people. We strongly condemn the Taliban\u2019s persistent systematic abuses of human rights, particularly against women and girls, and voices of dissent. We reaffirm our shared commitment to human rights and the dignity of the people of Afghanistan.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the foreign minister told SBS the Albanese government \"will not accept a Taliban representative.\"\n\nBut Professor Maley says DFAT's official statement doesn't rule it out as an option in future .\n\n\"If one looks at the statement that was put out of the Foreign Affairs Department, it's rather slippery on that particular point. It didn't say that Australia will never accept a Taliban diplomat representative or honorary consulate, it said Australia has no intention of doing so. And of course that's the kind of wording that people use if they want later to be able to say, oh, well we didn't intend it at the time, but we changed our minds.\"\n\nMs Zahid says she's firmly against the prospect of Australia accepting a Taliban representative as a diplomatic figurehead.\n\n\u201cI'd be more than upset and women like me in communities that are very much against having that kind of mind-set and ideologies to represent us. That would be a big no for us. And I'm sure we can at least rust this promise from our government, that our embassy will not be controlled or represented by those views.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone is opposed to the idea.\n\nFazal Katawazai, a former Afghan diplomat in Australia, says a relationship should be established to avoid further practical issues for Afghan Australians.\n\n\"The closure will create significant practical hurdles for Afghan Australians planning to visit Afghanistan. And also the travel documents, passport problems. In some extent, I think Australia need to have some kind of consular relationship as an honorary consular in Australia with the existing Taliban government.\"\n\nNeither the Australian government nor the embassy have outlined how Afghan citizens will receive essential consular services.\n\nErfan Abidi is the founder of an underground network of schools for girls in Afghanistan, and an active member of the Afghan community in Adelaide.\n\nHe told SBS Pashto for his community, the decision to close the embassy is about much more than being able to travel back to Afghanistan.\n\n\"For many Afghans in Australia, the Afghanistan embassy is more than an office. It is a wider symbol of identity, dignity, and connection to your homeland. It has also been the only official space where Afghans, particularly Afghan women, could raise their voices, share their concerns, and advocate for their rights. The panned closure feels like another fall of Afghanistan, but this time in exile, not in Afghanistan.\"",

Got it Share A A A\n\nA key section of Brisbane\u2019s Riverwalk has reopened, marking a milestone for the city and the revitalisation of the flood-prone CBD stretch. With the backdrop of the Story Bridge, the ribbon was cut on Tuesday by Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner and representatives of Dexus to officially open the Riverwalk following a three-year, $42 million transformation. The 256-metre stretch from Charlotte Street to Alice Street creates a continuous walking and cycling route from the Story Bridge at Howard Smith Wharves to the Botanic Gardens. Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner was among the group officially reopening the Riverwalk on Tuesday. Brittney Deguara \u201cYou couldn\u2019t imagine Brisbane without the Riverwalk, just like you couldn\u2019t imagine Brisbane without the CityCats and the Story Bridge,\u201d Schrinner said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said the council contributed $22 million to the project to upgrade it from a narrow section of path to the wide, flood-resilient promenade, but the \u201clion\u2019s share\u201d came from Dexus. \u201cThis is the section that I have no doubt tourists in 2032 will be flocking to as this whole precinct is activated. This is about making sure that Brisbane embraces its river,\u201d Schrinner said. He said ratepayers were getting \u201cbang for their buck\u201d through the funding partnership with Dexus, and that paying for the project in full would have cost the council tens of millions of dollars. The section has been fenced off since 2023, while work was done at the multibillion-dollar Waterfront Brisbane site, which will boast retail tenancies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe entire project was scheduled to open in 2027, but was delayed last year owing to construction complexities and bad weather. \u201cFor [Dexus] to keep ploughing ahead and delivering this great outcome against the odds is a fantastic outcome,\u201d Schrinner said. Schrinner walking the new path with Dexus chief executive Ross Du Vernet and project director for Waterfront Brisbane Matthew Beasley. Brittney Deguara \u201cI\u2019m more interested in what it does for the community rather than whether there [were] a few delays suffered. \u201cFor generations to come, people will forget about the extra few months it took, and they\u2019ll remember the great outcome that\u2019s been delivered.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLocals Wayne and Cathy Jeffries were among the first pedestrians to walk along the new path. \u201cI think after the floods they had to do something to bring it back, and looking forward, we\u2019ve got the Olympic Games coming up, so you\u2019ve got to make it look impressive for all the overseas guests,\u201d Wayne said. Wayne and Cathy Jeffries said they would use the walkway every couple of months when they ventured into the city. Brittney Deguara \u201cIt\u2019s great to see Brisbane progress and the new Kangaroo Point Bridge as well, and lovely new restaurants around the city, Queen\u2019s Wharf ... it is the place to be,\u201d Cathy added. The passage has been rebuilt with new paths and banisters, and three local street artists painted a Brisbane-themed mural at the start of the walkway in three days.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great aquatic theme, which is appropriate for a river city and a city based on Moreton Bay,\u201d Schrinner said. Waterfront Brisbane will eventually comprise two new office towers, shops, restaurants and public space. The aquatic-themed mural at Brisbane\u2019s Riverwalk took just three days to complete.

Got it Share A A A\n\nNationals MPs who were sacked for breaching shadow cabinet solidarity would be benched for six months under a fresh demand put by Opposition Leader Sussan Ley to Nationals leader David Littleproud. The pair met on Monday night and held what both parties described as constructive talks to reform the Coalition after it blew apart last month over a dispute about shadow cabinet discipline. Opposition Leader Sussan Ley on Tuesday morning. Alex Ellinghausen Ley revealed the offer in a Liberal Party room on Tuesday morning. According to sources in the room, Ley said the offer she made to Littleproud included that the three senators who resigned from the shadow cabinet a fortnight ago after crossing the floor would not be eligible to sit on the frontbench until July.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHer second demand was that shadow cabinet solidarity be reaffirmed by both parties. The backbench party rooms of both parties would not be able to overturn decisions made by the shadow cabinet, a point that was queried by two conservative MPs who raised concerns about the party room\u2019s right to have its say on party policy. These first two demands were put to Littleproud as non-negotiable by Ley, according to party sources. Opposition leader Sussan Ley addresses the media this morning. Alex Ellinghausen The Nationals expressed frustration that Ley\u2019s offer leaked out to the media before its own MPs were briefed on the offer. Littleproud released a statement at midday saying he would take his time to respond. \u201cAs per media reports, the Nationals have received a written offer from the Liberal Party,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will take our time to consider the details.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe Nationals are united in our endeavours to reset the Coalition, but we won\u2019t be providing updates on any negotiations through the media.\u201d As secondary requests, the Liberals would also reclaim the shadow assistant treasurer portfolio from the Nationals, with the skills portfolio given back in return. The Liberals covet the assistant treasurer portfolio because it takes in important policy areas such as superannuation. Nationals leader David Littleproud at the traditional pre-parliament church service on Tuesday morning. Alex Ellinghausen The Nationals would be able to pick three other MPs to fill the frontbench spots left by the resignations of Bridget McKenzie, Ross Cadell and Susan McDonald. Pressure has intensified on Littleproud this week as his own MPs backed a motion to get the Coalition back together, weeks after Liberals blamed him for recklessly allowing his party to vote against Labor\u2019s post-Bondi hate speech laws despite the shadow cabinet agreeing to back it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut both Littleproud and Ley have boxed themselves in, with Littleproud taking a hard line on a demand to reinstate the three frontbenchers who resigned last month, which Ley and her party room oppose, and also seeking greater flexibility for Nationals to cross the floor. While announcing the split 12 days ago, Littleproud said that the Nationals \u201ccannot be part of a shadow ministry under Sussan Ley\u201d, so any reconciliation would be a major backdown for the Nationals leader. Many MPs in both parties would like to see the two parties rejoin, even though some Moderate Liberals are keen to remain apart so that the Liberals can focus on city voters. Queensland backbencher Terry Young argued the split should be long-lasting. One Liberal MP said after Ley\u2019s briefing that the Nationals were \u201cparasitic\u201d as the regional party \u201csee the relationship with the Liberal Party as a way to enrich themselves\u201d rather than achieve mutual success. \u201cMany Liberals believe that are an unworthy coalition partner. Until they adopt a new mind set we are better off without them dragging us down to their level of mediocrity,\u201d said the MP, who spoke off the record to be candid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition leader Sussan Ley take their seats for an ecumenical service for the commencement of Parliament at St Paul\u2019s Anglican Church in Canberra. Alex Ellinghausen \u201cDavid Littleproud is no longer credible as a leader and a parliamentarian. He should consider his future,\u201d the MP said. \u201cPreferably a vocation that does not require any form of relationship management.\u201d This masthead reported on Monday that Ley\u2019s allies, battling to stave off a challenge from leadership rival Angus Taylor, were asking MPs to keep Ley in the job until at least the time of the federal budget in May. Speaking outside a church service to mark the opening of parliament on Tuesday, Ley said: \u201cVery confident of delivering a strong budget in reply speech in May.\u201d \u201cLots of work between now and May because we have a big agenda to prosecute,\u201d she said, adding that talks with Littleproud had been positive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLittleproud retained his position after facing a failed leadership challenge from rogue Nationals MP Colin Boyce on Monday. The Nationals leader said conversations last night between the two had been \u201cpositive\u201d but did not end in the Coalition re-forming. Nationals MP Darren Chester, who has been pushing Littleproud to soften and reunite with Ley, said on Tuesday that the Liberals could not determine who the Nationals appointed to the frontbench. \u201cI would have thought the leaders of both teams would choose their best performers in their eyes, to be on the shadow ministry, in the shadow cabinet.

Ayres notified the federal parliament on Tuesday that, following a legal change late last year that extended Canadian citizenship eligibility to the grandchildren of people born in the country, he had involuntarily become a dual citizen. Minister for Industry and Innovation Tim Ayres. Alex Ellinghausen The episode revived memories of the federal parliament\u2019s so-called constitutional crisis in 2017. Starting in July that year, a number of senators and members were disqualified from sitting in the federal parliament because they had failed to renounce or were eligible to hold citizenship of a second country, which they had failed to renounce. It eventually led to the disqualification of 15 MPs, including then-deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, now-Greens leader Larissa Waters and the current Finance Minister Katy Gallagher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrior to his election in 2019, Ayres took all possible steps to renounce his Canadian citizenship by descent, but was told at the time by the Canadian government that he had nothing to renounce as he was not eligible for citizenship. Related Article Live\n\nNational News Live Australia news LIVE: RBA interest rate decision today; Cory Bernardi recruited by One Nation as Ley, Littleproud fail to reach Coalition resolution But that changed in June last year when laws were introduced into the Canadian parliament to expand the right to citizenship, automatically, to anyone born to a Canadian parent and, in many cases, grandparent. The Canadian parliament made the changes to its citizenship laws after a 2023 court decision found that the country\u2019s laws, which limited citizenship by descent, were unconstitutional. After the laws to reclaim so-called \u201clost Canadians\u201d were introduced into the nation\u2019s parliament in June 2025, but before they came into effect on December 15 last year, Ayres sought advice from the Canadian government about how to renounce his citizenship, but was told he could not pre-renounce his dual citizenship.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAyres also took advice from senior counsel, who told him that he was still eligible to be a senator and minister because \u201cthe implied qualification to s 44(i) of the Australian Constitution recognised by the High Court would prevent a newly enacted foreign law from disqualifying a sitting member of the Australian parliament\u201d. Ayres\u2019 lawyer also advised him to renounce his Canadian citizenship as quickly as possible, which he did. Ayres on December 10 last year, days before he involuntarily became a Canadian citizen. Dominic Lorrimer It was not until Bill C-3, as the law is known, came into effect on December 15 that Ayres could renounce his Canadian citizenship. The very next day, he contacted the Canadian government and was advised that he could finally renounce his citizenship of that country. The process took two weeks, according to a letter dated December 29 from the director-general of the Canadian passport office in Ottawa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat letter states that \u201cthis document confirms that your application to renounce Canadian citizenship that was automatically conferred on you by operation of Canadian citizenship law was approved and you ceased to be a Canadian citizen on December 29, 2025\u201d. \u201cAs this document attests that you ceased to be a Canadian citizen, we suggest that you keep this document in a secure place for future reference.\u201d Ayres became a Canadian citizen because his grandfather was born in Canada in 1910, and was at that time a British subject. His grandfather later moved to Australia, and his father was born in Australia. The law change conferred Canadian citizenship on his father and, retrospectively, on the minister when the law change took effect. Ayres is one of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese\u2019s most trusted lieutenants and a key powerbroker in the party\u2019s left faction. He told this masthead that while grandfather was born in Canada, he had taken all steps possible to ensure before the 2019 and 2025 elections that he was only an Australian citizen and eligible to sit in parliament.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEditor's pick Political leadership Ley reveals fresh demand to Littleproud, including benching rebels for six months \u201cIn December 2025, Canada\u2019s Bill C-3 came into effect. As soon as the new Canadian law received Royal Assent, I established as soon as was legally possible that I was solely an Australian citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe advice I have received from constitutional experts is clear: I have always been \u2013 and remain \u2013 eligible to sit in the parliament. I take my constitutional responsibilities seriously and today have made an addendum to my Qualification Checklist confirming that I remain not a Canadian citizen.\u201d Professor Anne Twomey, a constitutional law expert at the University of Sydney, said previous High Court cases related to dual citizenship had not dealt with \u201cthe unusual case of a person being validly elected, but then, against their will, having foreign citizenship conferred upon them, and immediately renouncing it\u201d. \u201cIf this matter came before a court, there would be a good case to argue that it fell within an exception from disqualification, just as an exception also arises where there is an irremediable impediment to renouncing foreign citizenship,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn practical terms, it is unlikely to come before a court, because it could only get there if the Senate referred it. Doing so would have no advantage, other than clarifying the law, because the senator could simply resign and then fill the resulting vacancy, as he is no longer a Canadian citizen.\u201d Cut through the noise of federal politics with news, views and expert analysis.

Got it Share A A A\n\nWhy did the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s flagship publication publish at the weekend comments made by Xi Jinping back in 2024? The obvious answer, given that their publication would have had to be made with Xi\u2019s approval, is that he sees an opportunity as the \u201cSell America\u201d trade gains traction. Trump\u2019s chaotic policymaking is causing significant levels of distrust in America and its future. Getty The remarks published in Qiushi magazine focus on the role China\u2019s renminbi can play in global trade and foreign exchange markets, with Xi posing the rhetorical question of \u201cWhat constitutes a strong financial nation?\u201d \u201cFirst, it should have a powerful currency, widely used in international trade, investment and foreign exchange markets, holding the status of a global reserve currency,\u201d he answered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo achieve those objectives, China would need a powerful central bank capable of effective monetary management, globally competitive financial institutions and international financial centres able to attract global capital and exert influence over global pricing, he said. Xi\u2019s ambition of internationalising China\u2019s currency isn\u2019t recent or secret. Related Article Opinion\n\nFederal Reserve Trump\u2019s hand-picked man may not do his bidding Stephen Bartholomeusz Senior business columnist In recent years, it has accelerated its push to have the renminbi used as at least one side of trade transactions and has been doing that increasingly in trade with Russia, Iran, India, the Middle East and South American and African countries. About a third of its bilateral trade is now settled in renminbi. The recent stand-off with BHP, where China refused to allow the company to land some of its iron ore unless the trade was settled in renminbi, was a sign of a new willingness to use strong-arm tactics to coerce counterparties into using its currency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also built the payments infrastructure \u2013 its Cross-Border Interbank Payment System \u2013 to clear and settle international transactions in renminbi, to promote its internationalisation and to reduce reliance on the US dollar and the dominant US-dominated SWIFT financial messaging system. So, why dust off an old speech to articulate a previously largely unspoken but widely recognised ambition? With governance in the US apparently dysfunctional, its traditional allies unsettled and fearful and investors, governments starting to reduce their exposure to treasury markets and an economy whose settings are no longer regarded as risk-free, Xi senses a moment. Bloomberg It\u2019s because the US and the US dollar appear vulnerable. Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic policymaking, the international hostility and distrust generated by his trade war on the rest of the world, his assaults on multinational and domestic institutions, his threats to seize the territory of a NATO ally, his kidnapping of another country\u2019s president, his disdain for the US Constitution and domestic laws, his attack of the Federal Reserve board\u2019s independence, the accelerating build-up of US government debt and a fear that the administration is going to monetise that debt through money-printing and dollar depreciation are causing significant levels of distrust in America and its future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe demonstrated effect of the US-led seizure of Russian foreign exchange reserves at the onset of the war in Ukraine is another reason for foreign governments and their central banks to look for alternatives which, at the moment, appear to be largely a switch from US assets to gold. Central banks have doubled their purchases of gold since the seizure of Russia\u2019s reserves on 2022. In the post-war era, the US dollar and the US Treasury securities market have been regarded as the world\u2019s \u201csafe havens\u201d, but their status has been eroding since Trump first took office in 2017 and has deteriorated in the first year of his second term. It is reflected starkly in a depreciation of the dollar approaching 11 per cent against the basket of America\u2019s major trading partners since Trump\u2019s inauguration last year. Last week, Trump said he welcomed that decline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great. Look at the business we\u2019re doing. The dollar\u2019s doing great,\u201d he said. A weaker dollar makes US exports more competitive abroad. His Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, immediately tried to walk those comments back, saying America remained committed to a strong-dollar policy. \u201cIf we have sound policies, the money will flow in,\u201d he said. That is, of course, a big \u201cif,\u201d given the nature of Trump\u2019s policies to date. Xi\u2019s ambition of internationalising China\u2019s currency isn\u2019t recent or secret. A concern for foreign investors in the US and central banks holding US dollar-denominated reserves is that the chairman of Trump\u2019s council of economic advisers and his temporary appointee as a Fed board governor, Stephen Miran, authored a paper in 2024 which set out how to boost US exports and the US manufacturing sector, narrow its trade deficit and lower the cost of US government debt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe key to the \u201cMar-a-Lago Accord\u201d, as it has become known, is a controlled depreciation of the US dollar. While Miran seems to have envisaged a grand agreement with other countries to intervene in markets to achieve that objective, it\u2019s been happening anyway, in an uncontrolled fashion \u2013 which might explain why Bessent was so quick to try to distance himself and US Treasury policy from Trump\u2019s comments. For Miran\u2019s thesis to work, if it could work, dollar depreciation would have to occur in a measured way over a significant period. The \u201cSell America\u201d trade is gaining traction on markets. AP Igniting an exodus from US markets at a time when US government debt has surpassed $US38 trillion ($54.5 trillion) and is climbing \u2013 and when nearly half that debt will now roll over within two years because Bessent has replaced maturing longer-term bonds with lower interest cost Treasury bills and notes \u2013 would be a potentially destabilising and potentially crisis-inducing exercise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith the US governance apparently dysfunctional, its traditional allies unsettled and fearful, investors and governments starting to reduce their exposure to Treasury markets and an economy whose settings are no longer regarded as risk-free, Xi senses a moment. Sensing it is one thing. Taking advantage of America\u2019s moment of vulnerability is another. Related Article Analysis\n\nChina relations The 2027 question: Will Xi Jinping annex Taiwan this soon, or not? While the dollar\u2019s share of foreign exchange transactions, trade and central bank reserves has been sliding, it still remains the dominant currency in global financial activity. It\u2019s used in about 89 per cent of foreign-exchange transactions, about 60 per cent of global debt is denominated in dollars and 57 per cent of foreign exchange reserves are dollar-denominated. In contrast, China\u2019s currency is used in fewer than 9 per cent of foreign exchange transactions and constitutes only 1.93 per cent of global reserves. The euro has a stronger position, used in about 29 per cent of FX transactions and is the currency for about 20 per cent of the world\u2019s official reserves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo ever challenge the dollar as a reserve currency, China would need to make very significant changes to its policy settings, changes that would probably be unpalatable to the Communist Party. A reserve currency needs to be completely freely traded, which requires an open capital account and a freely floating currency whose value is determined by the market. China has tight capital controls \u2013 cross-border transactions have to be approved by a government agency \u2013 and manages its exchange rate tightly to ensure its stability. Related Article Opinion\n\nTrump's White House Trump is pushing China and Europe together to create a new world order Xi isn\u2019t going to relinquish control over his financial system so, even without the other features needed to achieve reserve currency status \u2013 transparent and trusted legal and judicial systems and deep and very liquid financial markets \u2013 his ambitions are unlikely to be realised within the forseeable future. China, and Europe, can, however, keep chipping away at the dollar\u2019s dominance and the effective subsidies of borrowing costs and the US standard of living that the rest of the world provides America, if only to reduce their own vulnerabilities to the Trump-driven shifts in America\u2019s relationship with the rest of the world.

Share A A A\n\nI\u2019m five minutes early to meet celebrated writer Kathy Lette at Crafted, the restaurant at the Art Gallery of NSW \u2013 and I\u2019m feeling a little nervous. The previous evening, I\u2019d watched her Australian Story profile \u2013 it ends with footage of a recent launch of one of her books, where she invites everyone to come up on stage and dance. She\u2019s also famous for serving up a \u201cDisco Diet\u201d at her many London dinner parties, with participants bopping for hours after dessert. Would this lunch go the same way? As a founding member of Inhibited Anonymous \u2013 and the last person to join a Gloria Gaynor flashmob \u2013 I sincerely hope not. Suddenly, Lette arrives, dressed in a trademark brightly patterned frock with matching lipstick and a pair of stilettos. She has chosen the restaurant because the gallery is currently showing an exhibition of Australian women artists, which is firmly in her wheelhouse. I\u2019m conscious she is going to visit her 91-year-old mother that afternoon, so we quickly peruse the menus and order what I call a \u201cStandard Girl Lunch\u201d \u2013 vegetables, fish and mineral water. Lette orders bottarga with crudite vegetables. The beetroot salad is calling me and we both order the barramundi. Kathy Lette says her mantra for her musician husband Brian O\u2019Doherty is \u201cthat he adores me, doesn\u2019t bore me, and does all my chores for me\u201d. Photo: Sam Mooy I clearly radiate AA vibes as none of my lunchers ever orders a drink. Of course, eliciting personal secrets from interview subjects by getting them tipsy is a well-worn journalistic technique, but it turns out that here, it\u2019s redundant. The 67-year-old author is quite capable of telling you her most intimate life stories \u2013 over a glass of water. Lette has been famous since 1979, when a book she co-wrote with the late Gabrielle Carey rocketed onto the Australian literary scene. Puberty Blues, about two very young women growing up in a surfer community in Cronulla, became a cause celebre for its graphic portrayals of underage sex and drug-taking, including heroin. Two years after publication, it was made into a movie directed by Bruce Beresford. Lette in 2021 at Elouera Beach, Cronulla, where the Puberty Blues movie based on her book was set. Photos: Louise Kennerley, Supplied\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHerald journalist Helen Pitt wrote about the movie on its 40th anniversary in 2021, saying it \u201cwas criticised for whitewashing the feminist themes of the book, in relation to rape, abortion and miscarriage ... The original movie shows a culture in which gang rape is incidental and unremarkable, and mindless violence is amusing. And yet it serves as a valuable timepiece\u201d. I asked Lette, who grew up in Cronulla, how many of her 21 books were based on her own life. All of them, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s cheaper than therapy \u2013 putting it on the page is a way of making sense of the drama. I\u2019ve written about everything: being a single girl around town in Sydney, trying to find a man who wasn\u2019t married or gay, moving to LA. I\u2019ve written about pregnancy, motherhood, raising a teenage daughter, raising an autistic son. I\u2019ve written about divorce, I\u2019ve written about affairs, I\u2019ve written about midlife trauma, and now I\u2019m writing about women post-menopause, because I think that\u2019s the most interesting time in a woman\u2019s life.\u201d The barramundi and spring vegetables. Kathy Lette\u2019s order of bottarga with crudite vegetables. The heirloom beetroot salad with whipped sunflower seed, mustard greens and pieces of orange. Photos: Sam Mooy\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA woman\u2019s 60s are liberating, she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the marriages, the divorces, we\u2019ve raised the children. We\u2019ve had the betrayals, the affairs, the heartbreak, the backstabs, all of that and the financial ups and downs. That material is so rich. And women survive it with such a good sense of humour,\u201d she says. Lette says hormones are key to women\u2019s lives, joking that she\u2019s book-ended her writing career with tomes about puberty and menopause. \u201cI think women don\u2019t come into their true selves till post-menopause, because women are brought up to be decorative and demure. But then after the menopause, when your estrogen drops, we no longer care what people think about us,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so I just find women this age fabulous, funny, fascinating. I\u2019m trying to encourage women my age to go forth and be fabulous because if not now, when?\u201d The author is a generous interviewee, talking in long sentences that give me time to eat my heirloom beetroot salad, which has whipped sunflower seed, mustard greens and pieces of orange, and is absolutely scrumptious. She doesn\u2019t have time to touch her entree of whipped cod roe, bottarga and crudites and asks to take it home to give to her partner, Irish-born musician Brian O\u2019Doherty, whom she describes as a \u201cbrilliant cook\u201d. We have both ordered the barramundi, which is on the menu as a special. It comes out as a thick wedge of beautifully tender fish topped with a crisp rectangle of skin, surrounded by a melange of mirepoix spring vegetables and crunchy seeds. For the thousandth time, I wonder why my own amateur kitchen offerings cannot achieve this perfect balance of textures and flavours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a few mouthfuls, we return to a perennial topic \u2013 when are our unmarried offspring going to give us some grandchildren? Lette reveals that she has given her daughter a gift of egg freezing for her next birthday. She has written about it (with her daughter\u2019s permission) for a British newspaper. The bill from Crafted, the restaurant at the Art Gallery of NSW. \u201cI used to think women could have it all. I still think women can have it all, but it\u2019s not all at once,\u201d she says. Lette says that when she gives talks in schools, she tells the young women to choose their partner carefully. \u201cBecause if you choose an alpha male, he\u2019s going to have a big career. If the child is sick, who do you think is the one who has to pull back? Yeah, it\u2019s always the woman,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had two alpha men, whom I adore [her former husbands ABC chair Kim Williams and London barrister Geoffrey Robertson, KC]. I still love them both, and I\u2019m very close to them. Right now, I\u2019ve got a beta. My mantra for him is that he adores me, doesn\u2019t bore me, and does all my chores for me. And it\u2019s incredible to have a beta man, and he wants me to be shining, and I earn more money, right? That\u2019s OK.\u201d I\u2019ve cyberstalked Lette\u2019s social media, finding photos of her going on holidays with Robertson and the children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGeoffrey\u2019s and my divorce was pretty amicable. We\u2019ve got two kids, one who has special needs [their 35-year-old son, Julius, is on the autism spectrum] so we\u2019ve got to stay friends,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I always say to my girlfriends, \u2018there was something about that person you loved and it is still there\u2019. Once you get over the pain and the wrangling, you can find that in that person again and try and concentrate on that. So especially if you\u2019ve got kids, it makes it much easier.\u201d Lette lives between a house in London and a light-filled apartment in Sydney\u2019s inner east. Being an Australian means you can escape the worst aspects of the British class system, she says. Rubbing royal shoulders: Prince Charles (now the King) greets Kathy Lette at a reception to mark Camilla\u2019s 70th birthday at Clarence House in 2017. Photo: Getty Images I ask her about her well-known friendship with the King and Queen. \u201cWhen I\u2019m with a member of the royal family and I say something cheeky, there\u2019s an audible gasp from the minders \u2013 \u2018did she really say that to the King?\u2019 But he always finds it funny and so does Camilla. I mean, I always say to them, \u2018I really like you, even though I don\u2019t believe in you.\u2019 I am a republican.\u201d How do they take that? I ask. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty sanguine,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, look what they\u2019ve been through.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Share A A A\n\nIt\u2019s been seven years since The Economist boldly declared 2019 \u201cthe year of the vegan\u201d, and it appears the vegan revolution is running out of steam, with some joking on social media that life has just become too depressing to swear off meat. Signs of veganism\u2019s decline first appeared back in 2023 when a YouGov survey found that just 6 per cent of Australians follow a vegan or vegetarian diet. For many industry experts, the collapse in the vegan boom has been a long time coming. It appears the vegan revolution is running out of steam. Getty Images \u201cI told investment companies 10 years ago that veganism is a niche of a niche,\u201d says Ged Futter, a retail expert and former buyer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Diet What\u2019s for dinner? The debate over fresh, frozen or canned veg \u201cIt was no surprise to me at all. Veganism sits within vegetarianism and no one really talks about vegetarianism any more.\u201d The current state of affairs is a far cry from five years ago, when shoppers could hardly move for vegan ad campaigns. Woolworths, Coles and Aldi all unveiled plant-based ranges while KFC, Krispy Kreme and Magnum made similar attempts to cash in on the vegan hype. But many are starting to realise that consumer appetite isn\u2019t there. Last year, Woolworths confirmed to 9News that it had reduced its vegan offering due to a decline in customer interest. Similarly, Coles also told the outlet it had \u201crefined\u201d its vegan range \u201cto better reflect customer demand\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the UK, popular restaurant chain Wagamama axed a string of vegan favourites from menus, including its \u201cVegatsu\u201d curry and its \u201cvegan K-Dogs\u201d. Andy Hornby, the chief executive of the chain\u2019s owner, The Restaurant Group, argued that interest from diners wasn\u2019t high enough to justify continuing the dishes. Marketing for the chain\u2019s most recent menu additions makes noticeably less of a fuss about its vegan credentials. \u201cPeople are realising that the volumes going through fully vegan products are very low,\u201d says Futter. \u201cFor manufacturers, when volumes are that small and you can\u2019t see a long-term future, there comes a point where you decide to do something else.\u201d Last year was also a reckoning for businesses that sought to dominate the vegan market.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Fitness The goal posts for a longer, healthier life are closer than you think In April, Neat Burger, the vegan burger chain backed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Lewis Hamilton, shut all of its UK restaurants after suffering substantial losses. Vegan specialities have also vanished from menus across Europe. The McDonald\u2019s plant burger was quietly pulled from Austrian Branches in July while Domino\u2019s shrank its vegan offering as part of a November relaunch. Meat-free menus are only a cost-saver for restaurants if vegan dishes sell, says Grace Withers, of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) \u2013 but consumer appetite has been overestimated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEven when veganism was at its most popular, we saw far more people claiming to be vegan than actually managing to stick to it,\u201d says Withers. \u201cPeople often lapsed when they were hungry and wanted something tasty. We saw this during Veganuary as well.\u201d Only 1 per cent of those who signed up for Veganuary made it to the end of the month having stuck to the diet, according to the AHDB, a public body which supports farmers and growers. Cost has also been a factor, as plant-based substitutes such as Quorn and tofu have increased in price more than cheaper meats in recent years. \u201cConsumers are very price-driven because of the cost-of-living crisis,\u201d says Withers. \u201cMeat-free products are more expensive than pig meat and chicken, so they are not competing on price.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Opinion\n\nNutrition RFK\u2019s new food pyramid is all sizzle and no steak Sarah Berry Lifestyle Health Editor Compounding vegan woes is the fact that some health-conscious consumers have moved on to other fads. \u201cAs the trend for strength training continues to grow in popularity, protein intake has become more of a priority,\u201d says Jenni Tardiff, a trainer at the Gym Group. Data from retail analyst Kantar show that 46 per cent of shoppers try to include high-protein in their diets, up from 38 per cent in 2022. Cultural headwinds have similarly shifted, particularly since Donald Trump re-entered the White House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe food pyramid unveiled by his health department earlier this month put dairy and healthy fats at the top. \u201cWe are seeing culture swing back towards celebrating real, simple food: red meat, butter and full-fat milk,\u201d says Bia Bezamat, of Kantar. \u201cProtein is easier to get from animal sources. Simplicity is resonating with people in a world that feels increasingly multi-layered and complex.\u201d The rise of weight-loss drugs has also been a factor, Bezamat says: \u201cWhen you are on medication, you need to make sure you eat the nutrients you need and a diet as restrictive as veganism does not really support that.\u201d Elsewhere, a growing pushback against so-called \u201cultra-processed foods\u201d has dented the popularity of meat-free substitutes. \u201cWhen you look at the back of the pack on some vegan products, the list of ingredients is enormous,\u201d says Futter.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cA large proportion of vegan products are made from things people don\u2019t really recognise or understand. Brands and supermarkets have recognised that this is not what customers are looking for.\u201d Despite the cut-through of the odd vegan product like oat milk, the hope of a wholesale vegan revolution has unravelled. \u201cI think there was an overestimation of how popular veganism would be,\u201d says Bezamat, who compares it to the rise and fall of gluten-free diets. \u201cThat was the original restrictive diet, where there was initially very little offer and then suddenly lots of products,\u201d she says. \u201cNow it just sits there on the shelf.\u201d The Telegraph, London\n\nSave You have reached your maximum number of saved items.

Got it Share A A A\n\nIt is almost common knowledge these days that a capital gain is taxed in the financial year that the contract is signed, not the year of settlement, and getting this wrong can result in double taxation of the same capital gain. Edward Sunna\u2019s case, ruled on by the Federal Court at the end of last year, highlights the danger of declaring the capital gain in the wrong year as you could end up being taxed in both years. Take careful note of the date you sign your sale contract, as it could be what saves \u2013 or costs \u2013 you thousands in tax. Suzanne White This is because the ATO has an unlimited time period to amend old tax returns to include a capital gain, but if the amendment period (usually 2 years) has passed, they cannot remove the capital gain from the incorrect year. In some scenarios, it is not so common knowledge as to which year applies. In Sunna\u2019s case, he signed the contract on June 28, 2019, but did not receive the deposit \u2013 which was nearly 50 per cent of the sale price \u2013 until after June 30, now in the 2019-2020 financial year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe then included the deposit in his 2020 tax return and when the sale of the $5.5 million Sydney unit went through in August 2022, he included the rest of the gain in his 2023 tax return. In reality, the whole of the gain should have been included in the 2019 tax return. So if you\u2019re planning on buying or selling a house soon, here\u2019s what you need to know: Sale of Asset: The capital gain goes in the tax return for the year that the contract was signed, regardless of when the deposit was received. If no contract was signed, then the year that the ownership of the asset transferred. As you can see, this can result in the deadline for lodging tax returns expiring before the outcome is known. You can lodge your tax return without the capital gai,n while the outcome remains uncertain, then amend within a month of settlement. The ATO undertakes not to charge interest or penalties providing the amendment is made within a reasonable time, generally a month.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOptions: If you enter into an option to sell your property and the option is exercised, the option proceeds are just included with the sale proceeds in the financial year that the option is exercised \u2013 i.e., the year that the contract for an actual sale is signed. Editor's pick Opinion\n\nProperty development Knocking down and rebuilding? Don\u2019t fall for these tax traps If the option is not exercised, then you need to include the option proceeds in the tax return for the year, back at the start, when the option was entered into. Forfeited Deposit: This goes into the tax return for the year that the deposit was forfeited. Note if the deposit is not forfeited, it just becomes part of the sale proceeds, so it applies to the tax return when the contract was signed. Section 107 of the Income Tax Assessment Act prevents the two-year amendment period limitation applying when an amendment is made to include a capital gain that has not been previously been included in the tax return for that year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe catch is that there is no similar provision to extend the amendment period to correct a capital gain incorrectly included in another year. So, the ATO can go back as far as it likes to include your capital gain in the correct year without having to remove it from the tax return for the year in which it was mistakenly included. This will result in the capital gain being taxed twice. Sunna\u2019s case found that there was no real impediment to this happening. If this article has raised any concerns, you can apply to the ATO to exercise their discretion to allow the amendment period to be extended on the tax return where the capital gain was incorrectly included.

(Mick Tsikas/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"Too many workers can no longer afford to live near where they work, and a growing number of workers will never be able to save enough for a deposit,\" ACTU president Michele O'Neil said.\n\n\"At the same time, accelerating rents and house prices are outpacing the money people can save each week.\"\n\nCalls to scale back the discount, which was introduced by the Howard government in 1999 and aims to compensate investors for inflation, have been echoed by think tanks such as the Grattan Institute and NSW Treasury.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn a recent interview with Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz published in The Monthly, federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the government was instead focused on other ways to make housing more affordable, by encouraging new supply.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed just over 195,000 new homes were approved nationwide in 2025, after dwelling consents fell 14.9 per cent in December to 15,542.\n\nTo meet the national housing accord target of 1.2 million new homes over five years, the industry needs to be building new homes at a rate of 240,000 each year.\n\nThe drop in approvals in December was driven by a 29.8 per cent fall in approvals for private dwellings excluding houses, ABS head of construction statistics Daniel Rossi said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt comes after a 29.6 per cent rise in November and demonstrates the volatile nature of the data.\n\nData shows home prices rose 8.6 per cent in 2025 and climbed a further 0.8 per cent in January.
