        "text": "President Donald Trump said he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10 per cent because of an anti-tariff television ad aired by the province of Ontario.\n\nThe ad used the words of former President Ronald Reagan to criticise US tariffs, angering Trump who said he would end trade talks with Canada.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said he would pull the ad after the weekend, and it ran Friday night during the first game of the World Series.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he plans to hike tariffs on imports of Canadian goods by an extra 10 per cent. (AP)\n\n\u201cTheir Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD,\u201d Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform as he flew aboard Air Force One to Malaysia.\n\n\"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10 per cent over and above what they are paying now.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear what legal authority Trump would use to impose the additional import taxes.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on when the 10 per cent hike would come into effect, and whether it would apply to all Canadian goods.\n\nCanada's economy has been hit hard by Trump's tariffs, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has been trying to work with Trump to lower them.\n\nMore than three-quarters of Canadian exports go to the U.S., and nearly $3.6 billion Canadian ($3.9 billion AUD) worth of goods and services cross the border daily.\n\nDonald Trump Truth Social post on Canada tariffs (Truth Social)\n\nA spokesperson for Carney didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMany Canadian products have been hit with a 35 per cent tariff, while steel and aluminium face rates of 50 per cent.\n\nEnergy products have a lower rate of 10 per cent, while the vast majority of goods are covered by the U.S.-Canada-Mexico Agreement, and are exempt from tariffs.\n\nThat trade agreement is slated for review. Trump negotiated the deal in his first term, but has since soured on it.\n\nTrump and Carney will both attend the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in Malaysia. But Trump told reporters traveling with him that he had no intention of meeting Carney there.\n\nTrump said the ad misrepresented the position of Reagan, a two-term president and a beloved figure in the Republican Party. But Reagan was wary of tariffs and used much of the 1987 address featured in Ontario's ad spelling out the case against tariffs.\n\nTrump has complained the ad was aimed at influencing the U.S. Supreme Court ahead of arguments scheduled for next month that could decide whether Trump has the power to impose his sweeping tariffs, a key part of his economic strategy.\n\nLower courts had ruled he had exceeded his authority.",

(Gidget Foundation)\n\n\"She was perfectly healthy and thriving,\" Cooper said.\n\n\"We were in our love bubble, it was so special and she was reaching every milestone effortlessly.\n\n\"But around the 12-week mark, I came tumbling down, like a brick wall.\"\n\n\"I was absolutely riddled with fear and dread so deep in my bones that I could barely eat and I couldn't sleep.\n\nCooper describes the emotional rollercoaster of having tried for a baby for so long, and then deciding to stop trying, only to then fall pregnant unexpectedly and carry a baby to term, as being completely overwhelming.\n\n\"You so desperately want answers, but there are none to give,\" she said.\n\n\"There's the hope and the grief and the anxiety and the shame, and that real feeling of failure, and almost desperation of like, 'my body is meant to be able to do this, why can't it?'\n\n\"We were broken, we were worn out physically and emotionally, and we sort of came to a place of surrender and acceptance.\"\n\nIt was after a year of travelling and rekindling their relationship that Cooper unexpectedly fell pregnant again, but she was immediately anxious.\n\n\"Given my history, I pretty much resigned myself to the fact that I was just gonna wait for (another) miscarriage, essentially.\n\n\"And then she actually arrived and she was this perfect baby.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh my God, I don't know what to do. I can't stuff this up... I've got to do right by her'.\"\n\nSkye was born during the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning \ufeffthe Coopers could not have visits from family.\n\n\"It was just the two of us battling away, and we had absolutely no idea what we were doing,\" Cooper said.\n\n\"\ufeffAround the six-month mark, I really distinctly remember my husband was at work and Skye was on the change table, and she was trying so hard to like babble and giggle and engage with me and I remember looking at her, and it was just nothing there, it was just emptiness.\n\n\"It was just this devastating feeling of 'this poor baby deserves so much more than me as her mum'.\"\n\nAt that point, Cooper knew she needed help and had a telehealth consult with her GP, who referred her to the Gidget Foundation.\n\nMarcelle Cooper, now a 'Gidget Angel' speaks at the opening of Gidget House Burleigh Heads. (Gidget Foundation)\n\nGidget Foundation Australia is a not-for-profit organisation that supports expectant, new and potential parents who may be experiencing perinatal depression or anxiety with specialist care, including up to 10 bulk-billed, face-to-face, individual psychological counselling sessions for clients referred by their GP with a mental health care plan.\n\n\"It was just an instant sense of relief,\" Cooper said.\n\n\"I was so ashamed and felt so guilty and like I was such a failure and I thought I was the only person in the world that ever felt like that.\"\n\nShe began fortnightly \ufeffconsults with a Gidget clinician, via videolink due to the on-going pandemic.\n\n\"\ufeffThey really grounded me and it never felt overwhelming... it was so self-paced.\n\n\"I felt like I could share my worries with someone without feeling like I was burdening my loved ones because they felt quite helpless as well.\"\n\nAccording to Gidget Foundation, one-in-five mums and one-in-10 dads will be diagnosed with perinatal depression and anxiety.\n\nThe foundation is the largest supplier of perinatal mental health support services\ufeff but they only see 4.5 per cent of the 100,000 parents diagnosed annually.\n\n\"We know that there's roughly 95 per cent of people (who) are either trying to source out a private psychologist, which is rare and hard to find with specialist skills, but also probably going without, so we know the demand is really significant,\" Gidget Foundation CEO Arabella Gibson said.\n\nREAD MORE: Specialist taskforce to take over search for Dezi Freeman\n\nGidget Foundation CEO Arabella Gibson. (Gidget Foundation)\n\nEarly intervention is critical to changing the trajectory of families experiencing perinatal depression and anxiety, Gibson said.\n\n\"\ufeffHaving a baby, the identity change that brings, the responsibility that brings, the pressures, financially, personally, from a relationship perspective, there's so many changes that we go through..\n\n\"So many people will go on for years feeling horrific and terrible and resorting to drugs, alcohol, gambling, whatever, when in fact, if we got in early, got them the support they need, gave them the tools and talked through the issues, we could actually capture a whole lot of heartache within a matter of months and have them back on track again.\n\n\"I know that probably sounds really simple, but in actual fact, it is that simple, because there is still a stigma around perinatal mental health, because it's meant to be a time of joy but actually it can quite often be incredibly challenging and the weight of bringing a new human into the world can be very heavy.\"\n\nThere are now 39 Gidget Houses across Australia - including the latest location which opened at Stockland Burleigh Heads on the Gold Coast last week.\n\nA Gidget House consultation room at Burleigh Heads. (Gidget Foundation)\n\nThe Gidget Foundation was named after a young mother who took her own life while experiencing postnatal depression\ufeff.\n\n\"(Gidget) had the beautiful marriage and the beautiful home, and the great job and the beautiful friends and everything like that,\" Cooper said.\n\n\"It doesn't discriminate.\n\n\"\ufeffAsking for help isn't a weakness, that's the strength, and that was definitely the scariest and most courageous thing I did.\n\n\"But it wasn't until I did reach out that everything changed.\"\n\nBaby Skye is now about to turn five, and will start school next year.\ufeff\n\n\"She's so caring and she's super sensitive to everyone else's feelings,\" Cooper said.\n\n\ufeff\"We look at each other sometimes and we're like, wow, this little human is so lovely.\"\n\nGidget Foundation Australia is not a crisis support service.\ufeff\n\nPerinatal mental health support is available from the PANDA National Helpline on 1300 726 306.\n\nThe Red Nose Grief and Loss Support Line is available 24/7 for anyone affected by the loss of a pregnancy, stillbirth or death of a baby or child on 1300 308 307.\n\nReaders seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636.

        "text": "The death of a toddler who became trapped on a fence at a childcare centre outside Darwin last year after being unaccounted-for for up to 10 minutes was preventable, a coroner has found.\n\nEbony Thompson was found by a staff member hanging from the 900mm high loop-top fence in a \"blind spot\" behind a shed at the Humpty Doo Community & Child Care Centre on August 31 and could not be revived.\n\nIn handing down her findings into the 22-month-old's death, Coroner Elisabeth Armitage ruled Ebony had been trapped in the fence for at least four minutes after trying to lean over it to see into the centre's chicken coop.\n\nJudge Armitage said the lack of a \"yard check\" in the centre's \"active supervision strategy\" represented a \"systemic failure\" by the centre and childcare regulator Quality Education and Care Northern Territory (QECNT).\n\nThe Humpty Doo Community & Child Care Centre is about 37 kilometres south-east of Darwin. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)\n\nShe said the centre's response to an earlier incident in which a child wandered through an open gate into the centre's car park had failed to address shortcomings in the strategy.\n\n\"There was clearly a lapse of supervision, during which time this escape occurred, and the outcome could have been far more serious if the child had not been located and promptly returned to the centre,\" she said.\n\n\" The fact that Ebony was not positively accounted for over a 10 minute period demonstrates that in spite of those efforts, there was another occasion of inadequate supervision, this time with tragic results. \"\n\nJudge Armitage found that while it would be \"impossible to eliminate all supervision lapses\" QECNT had also failed to appreciate or adequately manage the risk posed by the fence.\n\nThe gate to the chicken coop was secured behind a taller flat-topped gate after Ebony's death and has since been removed. (Supplied: NT Courts)\n\n\"Immediately after the incident involving Ebony, a new blue gate was fitted minimising the possibility of children accessing the blind spot or the chicken coop gate,\" she said.\n\n\"And later, the island shed and chicken coop gate were removed, thereby eliminating both environmental hazards.\n\n\" Tragically, this simple fix was too late for Ebony. \"\n\nJudge Armitage acknowledged that childcare centres were regulated nationally but urged the NT government to advocate for upgraded fencing requirements and conduct a public awareness campaign about the dangers of loop-top fencing.\n\nShe also recommended the government conduct \"a supervision audit across all childcare centres in the NT\" and impose penalties on any that failed to rectify identified issues in a timely manner.\n\nEbony's family say childcare centres found in breach of their supervision obligations should be forced to rectify the issues. (Supplied)\n\nEbony's family called on the government to ban loop-top fencing under the banner of \"Ebony's Law\" and introduce a \"three strikes rule\" that would see centres in breach of their supervision obligations \"immediately temporarily closed pending assessment and rectification\".\n\n\"While my recommendations are not as comprehensive as those submitted by the family, each of the family\u2019s recommendations is worthy of close consideration by the NT government and I have repeated all of them in full so that can occur,\" Judge Armitage said.",

        "text": "The Uniting Church will abandon its state heritage-listed church in the middle of Mount Gambier because of escalating costs to fix the 154-year-old building's steeple.\n\nThe church's pastor says the controversial move will allow him and the congregation to focus on Christian ministry rather than the building that services are held in.\n\nAn architecture lecturer says the sale of churches is a growing trend but it can allow heritage buildings to stay standing rather than falling into disrepair.\n\nPastor Dave Sigley outside St Andrew's Uniting Church. (ABC South East SA: Eugene Boisvert)\n\nThe Mount Gambier congregation voted on October 12 to move out of St Andrew's church on Elizabeth Street and to sell the building and the 9,500 square metres of land that surrounds it.\n\nThe vote came ahead of a deadline of October 30 set by the Uniting Church's statewide body, known as a synod, to make a decision on its future.\n\nThe steeple of Mount Gambier's St Andrew's Uniting Church has been fenced off for eight years. (ABC South East SA: Eugene Boisvert)\n\nHuge cost to avoid catastrophe\n\nA report produced by the synod in September said the rickety state of the spire meant there was an \"extreme risk of a catastrophic outcome\" through it collapsing.\n\nThe church was quoted $1.26 million to fix it.\n\nSt Andrew's Presbyterian Church, as it was formerly known, was built in 1871 with a spire built to be slightly taller than the nearby Catholic church.\n\nSt Andrew's Presbyterian Church in a photo from 1875. (Supplied: State Library of South Australia)\n\nThe spire was rebuilt in 1885, damaged in an earthquake in 1897, partially rebuilt in 1928 and repaired again in 1980.\n\nReverend Dave Sigley said the congregation did have enough money to pay for the repairs but then it would not have any funds to pay him, nor could it cover other maintenance on the building or his charitable works.\n\n\"The congregation chose to focus on the mission of the church and outreach rather than focusing on the building,\" he said.\n\n\"We believe that was important because, if we did fix it, we could have stayed in the building, but the congregation wouldn't have the resources or the funds to have a minister, for starters, and to continue with our outreach.\n\n\"For us, even though it's been a very difficult decision, and we lament that, and there's a lot of people who are feeling pain in this \u2014 myself included \u2014 we realise that the mission of the church and living out the mission of Christ is more important than maintaining a historical building.\"\n\nDave Sigley has led worship at St Andrew's for eight years but was only ordained as a minister in June. (ABC South East SA: Bec Whetham)\n\nThe congregation plans to hold its last service in the old church in January before moving to a new, hired space.\n\nSynod moderator Peter Morel said it was sad to leave the Gothic Revival church but there were many people looking for churches in non-traditional buildings with spaces such as creches separate to the main body of the church.\n\n\"The times have changed greatly and we need to be flexible [and] adaptable, as we're looking forward to newer ways of engaging people in our local communities,\" he said.\n\nEmergency food relief is provided at the Uniting Church. (ABC South East SA: Eugene Boisvert)\n\nSale could save building\n\nUniversity of Melbourne architectural design and history lecturer Stuart King said there was an ongoing trend of churches having to sell their buildings, including because of costs associated with the child abuse redress scheme.\n\nSon of TV royalty Ernie Sigley's journey from pig farming to preaching Born to TV royalty, the son of Ernie Sigley couldn't wait to escape to the country, a passion he shared with his famous father.\n\nDr King said keeping heritage buildings standing often meant finding new uses for them.\n\n\"Really, the best way to maintain them and to maintain a whole lot of values associated with them is to ensure that they have an ongoing use,\" he said.\n\n\"There is this challenge there about how you do that and whether the church community is able to sustain an ongoing use or whether or not you look at adapting them to different uses.\"\n\nA 2007 report by specialist heritage conservation architect Elizabeth Vines said St Andrew's church was \"indicative of the spread of Presbyterianism through the state\".\n\n\"The quality of architectural design and building construction is indicative of the degree of affluence of the Presbyterian congregation in the South East during the Edwardian period,\" she wrote.\n\nSt Andrew's has a prominent place in Mount Gambier's skyline. (ABC South East SA: Eugene Boisvert)\n\nAnger among congregation\n\nThe Uniting Church also has congregations in Mount Gambier's east and at Port MacDonnell.\n\nThey have decided not to merge, even if the Mount Gambier congregation decides to hold its Sunday services in the same building as the Mount Gambier East group.\n\nMegan McKenzie used to be the congregation chair at St Andrew's but now worships at the Port MacDonnell Uniting Church, even though she lives in Mount Gambier.\n\nShe said the decision to sell the church was \"appalling\".\n\nThe church was quoted $1.26 million to fix the steeple. (ABC South East SA: Eugene Boisvert)\n\n\"That church was built by our forebears at great physical and financial cost,\" she said.\n\n\"We owe it to them to honour the fact that they built a church for the people of Mount Gambier to care for, to be cared for, by the minister of the times.\"",

        "text": "Details of a report expected to recommend the Nationals dump its support for net zero emissions by 2050 will be presented to the party on Monday, but the review has not undertaken economic modelling of the costs of doing so.\n\nNationals deputy leader and outspoken net zero opponent Matt Canavan led the review with his Senate colleague Ross Cadell and told Insiders on Sunday he would be presenting findings to his colleagues when parliament resumes.\n\nBut he flagged that discussions over the party's position were likely to be ongoing and it could take time for the matter to be settled, while declaring that it was clear Australians were not \"getting a good deal from net zero\" .\n\n\"I'll present work as I have been doing the last few weeks, but you probably have bosses or had bosses over your career, sometimes when you present something, they tell you: that's not good enough, go back and do some more work,\" he said.\n\n\"So that may very well happen tomorrow, as well.\"\n\nSenator Canavan also confirmed the review had not yet undertaken economic modelling to estimate the cost of dumping the net zero target, pointing instead to the cost of pursuing the target and the \"benefit of avoiding those costs\".\n\n\"It's very clear that the cost of not doing something is avoiding the cost of doing it. That's pretty common-sense,\" he said in a firey exchange.\n\n\"The lived reality of net zero is clear. It is not working for the Australian people.\n\n\"Sure, there's a role for modelling, but the old saying is also true that if you ask an economist how to open a can of tuna, they'll say: 'Let's assume that we have a can opener.'\"\n\nClimate policy has long been a point of contention within the Coalition and led to a brief split between the Nationals and Liberals after the federal election in May.\n\nIf the minor party does decide to dump the net zero commitment, it could potentially once again drive a wedge through the partnership.\n\nJoyce 'should come along' to Nationals party room\n\nThe Nationals senator also threw his support behind fellow net zero critic Barnaby Joyce, who last week announced he would not recontest his seat of New England at the next election after days of speculation that he was in talks to join Pauline Hanson's One Nation.\n\nWhile Mr Joyce technically remains a member of the Nationals, he last week said his relationship with the party's leader had irreparably broken down, raising questions about whether he would join the party room meeting when parliament resumes on Monday.\n\nSenator Canavan said he hoped Mr Joyce would come along.\n\n\"It's unfortunate when people don't feel that they're part of the team and loved,\" he said.\n\n\"And I know lots of people have reached out to him in the last few weeks and as I say, I'd love to keep him part of the team.\"\n\nUsing a sporting analogy, he said even if Mr Joyce was, as he has called himself, a \"free agent\", it made sense to keep him on the field.\n\n\"Support for net zero is dropping off a cliff,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think that Barnaby played a role in that.\"",

Musculoskeletal claims are also on the rise.\n\nIn the chilled rooms of Australia's meat-processing plants, Chris Fitzgerald is one professional investigating how technology could turn the trend around.\n\nThe ergonomist watches as workers strap on the Iron Hand \u2014 a high-tech glove linked via cables to a powered backpack.\n\nWorkers are being fitted with a glove that improves grip strength. (Supplied: Bioservo)\n\n\"This is truly a revolutionary device,\" he said.\n\nThe device, known as an exoskeleton, uses fingertip sensors to boost grip strength.\n\nIt assists when performing tasks that require high grip including consistent knife use for skinning, trimming, and vertical and table boning.\n\n\"[In] sheep processing, they'll process one every 6 seconds or so. With beef, it's probably closer to once a minute,\" he said.\n\n\"It's repetitive. There's not a lot of relief from that.\"\n\nExoskeletons such as the Iron Hand assist with a meatworker's grip. (Supplied: Chris Fitzgerald)\n\nIt is part of an Australian Meat Processor Corporation (AMPC) project exploring how technology could help reduce injuries in one of the country's most physically demanding sectors.\n\nStarting with 20 devices designed to support the hands, back and legs, Mr Fitzgerald has narrowed the list to six models \u2014 with promising feedback.\n\n\"I've had people with lacerated tendons say, 'My hand feels normal [after wearing it],'\" he said.\n\nThe AMPC is sharing the data with abattoirs to help guide future decisions.\n\nBut with some exoskeleton gloves costing more than $15,000 each, companies will need to weigh the benefits, from worker comfort to productivity gains through reduced strain and injury.\n\nFlat out with flat pack\n\nRetail giant Ikea has already gone global with exoskeletons, rolling out more than 400 units across 14 countries last year to reduce warehouse injuries and fatigue.\n\nThe company says the technology helps minimise the physical toll of heavy lifting and repetitive motion, allowing workers to finish shifts with \"more energy\".\n\nGold Coast physiotherapist Brad Beer sees both promise and pitfalls in the rise of robotic assistance.\n\nBrad Beer says exoskeletons offer promise in allowing workers to be more efficient and less prone to injury. (Supplied: Pogo Physio)\n\n\"It's very early days,\" he said.\n\n\"They offer potentially great promise in allowing workers to be more efficient, potentially less injury-prone, [and] potentially have a greater lifespan at work, but there can be downsides potentially as well.\n\n\"It's important to note that force is absolute. It doesn't disappear. The body just shifts it to other areas.\"\n\nBut while Mr Beer said careful integration was essential to avoid creating new types of strain injuries, he remained optimistic.\n\n\"It might be a little bit like AI. I wouldn't be surprised if we see [it] infiltrate into every industry,\" he said.\n\n\"In many ways, it's an exciting time to be alive. We've never seen such rapid technological change.\n\n\"There'll be a move with AI-driven exoskeletons that absolutely are autonomous with the human body.\"\n\nThe AI-enhanced worker\n\nThat future may already be taking shape, at least in Europe.\n\nIn May, robotics firm German Bionic unveiled Exia, which it called \"the world's first exoskeleton powered end-to-end by true augmented AI\".\n\nGerman Bionic says its exoskeleton can anticipate user needs and optimise support in real time. (Supplied: German Bionic)\n\nBuilt on billions of motion data points from logistics, health care and manufacturing, the device can reportedly offer up to 38 kilograms of lift assistance while continuously learning from its user.\n\n\"Exia doesn't merely respond or even just think \u2014 it actually learns,\" CEO Armin G. Schmidt said.\n\nBack in Australia, Mr Beer said there was no need to fear a robotic takeover.\n\n\"There's a fair degree of apprehension and fear that these things will take over,\" he said.\n\n\"They won't take people's jobs, but they'll augment them and help them.\"\n\nHe has seen firsthand the toll a manual job can have on a person.\n\n\"My father had his working career in the meat industry,\" Mr Beer said.\n\n\"Certainly, meat processing is probably one of the more demanding professions anyone could have.\n\n\"Long hours standing on their feet, performing all those repetitive movements, reaching, twisting, and carrying heavy carcasses. It's not for the faint-hearted.\n\n\"Having seen that firsthand, the exoskeleton integration has potentially great promise in an industry like that.\"",

(ABC News)\n\n\"We had independent driving instructors rate competency among students, not knowing who had done the course prior,\" she said.\n\n\" The children who did [the course] first, came out 48 per cent more competent and 17 per cent less anxious. \"\n\nLisa Skaife's technology was cited in the final report of the Parliamentary Inquiry into Road Safety in 2022.

(ABC News: Loretta Lohberger)\n\nTasmanian Council of Social Service (TasCOSS) chief executive Adrienne Picone said it highlighted the interim and first full budgets would potentially contain \"some significant cuts for organisations and certainly no new money\".\n\n\"This is really concerning for many of our members, particularly in the light of the increase in demand that many organisations are experiencing,\" she said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Tasmanian government said it \"highly values the work of community organisations and invests significantly in their work\".\n\n\"All feedback received through the community consultation process will be considered as part of the normal budget process,\" they said.\n\nOrganisations forced to downsize to survive\n\nHobart City Mission's (HCM) Harvey Lennon said any further cuts to the sector would \"push some not-for-profits to the brink\".\n\n\"We've sadly let a few people go over the last couple of months to help us get by,\" he said.\n\n\" We're also looking at options, such as the sale and lease-back of a couple of our properties, just to give us a bit more breathing room, whilst we navigate the current challenges that the community are facing. \"\n\nAs HCM battles for its own survival, it's also seeing as much need in the community as ever, doubling the number of food bags it has given out in the last two years.\n\n\"That's a huge increase, and just represents how tough people are finding things at the moment \u2014 people who are making decisions between funding doctors' bills, feeding themselves and feeding their children,\" Mr Lennon said.\n\nHarvey Lennon warns further cuts to the sector would \"push some not-for-profits to the brink\". (ABC News: Will Murray)\n\nMr Lennon said even if the government couldn't entirely fund organisations, partial funding could allow them to leverage further funding from other benefactors.\n\nMs Picone said many other TasCOSS members were worried they would have to consider cuts to staff or programs if the upcoming budgets cut funding.\n\n\" What this will mean is that waiting lists will grow and that Tasmanians won't be able to access the services they need, where and when they need them. \"\n\nMs Picone said the sector understood the budget was in a \"pretty dire shape\", but urged the government not to cut \"essential\" community services.\n\n\"The way we spend our money comes down to how our government makes choices, and we would really urge our government to make the choice to invest in Tasmanians and Tasmanians' well-being,\" she said.\n\nJeremy Rockliff (centre) reacts as the no-confidence motion passes in parliament in June.

Head, Green and/or Webster are in, then keeper Carey and the bowlers.

Contemporary mental coaching doesn\u2019t emphasise the acknowledgement of your own weaknesses. The modern athlete wants to talk a good game before they play it, which surely only increases the pressure when it comes to \u201cwalking the walk\u201d.\n\nThe Australians will be fortified rather than diminished by England\u2019s name-calling.

        "text": "The visitors, who moved up to second place in the table, had gone behind in the fourth minute when Alejandro Garnacho claimed his first goal for Chelsea, cutting in from the left and shooting through the legs of Sunderland goalkeeper Robin Roefs. The Londoners\u2019 lead was cancelled out by Wilson Isidor\u2019s equaliser in the 22nd minute when the Frenchman stabbed in from close range after Chelsea failed to deal with a long throw. The game appeared to be heading for a draw as Chelsea failed to find a way through the Black Cats\u2019 disciplined midfield and defensive lines. In the third minute of added time, however, Talbi collected a pass by fellow substitute Brian Brobbey and the Morocco winger placed his low shot perfectly for his first goal for Sunderland since signing from Club Brugge in July.\n\nSunderland coach Regis Le Bris said his players had found the right balance between pressing Chelsea high up the pitch in key moments before holding their deep blocking formation. Sunderland\u2019s Wilson Isidor celebrates after scoring his side\u2019s first goal. Credit: AP \u201cIt\u2019s a good performance, especially after the early goal,\u201d the Frenchman told reporters. \u201cWe won three points. We are happy with the way we played. It is important to grab this opportunity when possible.\u201d Enzo Maresca\u2019s men had been seeking their third league win in a row after victories over Liverpool and Nottingham Forest but failed to build on their early lead. Brazilian teenager Estevao, who came on to score the winner in the 2-1 victory over Liverpool, was largely held at bay by Sunderland after he replaced Garnacho in the 58th minute.\n\nChelsea\u2019s Alejandro Garnacho shoots during the match against Sunderland.

These are the games we want to play in and we can\u2019t use that as an excuse.\u201d Man United hang on to make it three wins in a row The crisis is over for Manchester United. For now at least.\n\nA third straight win in the Premier League finally has Ruben Amorim\u2019s team moving in the right direction, up to the heady heights of the top five on Saturday and with a sense of momentum not felt for a long time at Old Trafford. A 4-2 win against Brighton extended coach Amorim\u2019s best run of league wins since he was appointed last November. It was the first time United had won three in a row in England\u2019s top flight since February 2024. Victory also ended Brighton\u2019s winning streak in this fixture, which dated back three seasons. It is still too early to tell if Amorim has turned a corner after such a wretched start to his tenure, including the 20-time champion\u2019s worst-ever season in the Premier League last term.\n\nBut coming on the heels of last week\u2019s morale-boosting win at Liverpool, the signs are positive, even if Brighton sparked a fightback to make it a nervy finish for the home fans. A prime source of encouragement for Amorim is the manner in which his summer signings have added a new dimension. Brazil forward Matheus Cunha scored his first goal for the club with a curling shot from outside the area to give United a 24th-minute lead. Manchester United\u2019s Bryan Mbeumo, front, celebrates scoring his side\u2019s third goal with teammates. Credit: AP Bryan Mbeumo also scored twice in the second half, making it three in his last two games, after Casemiro had doubled the lead with a deflected effort before the break.\n\nIt was a former United player, Danny Welbeck, who gave Brighton hope with a brilliant free kick that flew into the top corner and when substitute Charalampos Kostoulas headed another goal in time added on, the tension rose inside the stadium. Then came Mbeumo\u2019s second to snuff out any chance of a collapse and ensure the winning streak continued. Thrilling late win for Newcastle United over Fulham Newcastle United\u2019s dramatic late 2-1 Premier League win over Fulham on Saturday may prove more than just three points \u2014 it could be the emotional spark their season needs, said United boss Eddie Howe. Bruno Guimaraes\u2019 90th-minute strike rescued the Magpies from what looked like a damaging draw, and Howe believes the timing of the goal could have a ripple effect.\n\n\u201cLate goals don\u2019t just affect the game you\u2019ve won, they affect mood and belief going forward,\u201d Howe said. \u201cIt can have a big knock-on effect. We\u2019ve had heartbreak the other way. This felt like a massive moment for us. We found a way to win.\u201d Newcastle\u2019s win was just their third of the season and saw them climb provisionally to 10th in the table. Howe wants more though after last season\u2019s fifth-place finish and a League Cup victory.\n\nThe Magpies were looking to get their league campaign back on track after last weekend\u2019s disappointing 2-1 loss at Brighton and Hove Albion, but were buoyed by their emphatic 3-0 Champions League victory over Benfica midweek. Howe had talked of reigniting Newcastle\u2019s Premier League push \u2014 and his side backed up that ambition with a purposeful start with Jacob Murphy scoring in the 18th minute. Bruno Guimaraes celebrates his winning goal. Credit: Getty Images Sasa Lukic drew the visitors level in the 56th minute and the game looked to be heading towards a draw before Guimaraes\u2019 late-game heroics. Substitute William Osula drove to the edge of the box, but his shot was parried into the path of Guimaraes by goalkeeper Bernd Leno, and the Brazilian poked it in from close range.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one I\u2019ll remember, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Howe said. \u201cYou always remember when you win late, and it was a priceless win for us ... a big three points.\u201d Howe had praised Guimaraes\u2019 durability in logging thousands of miles to play for club and country in his pre-game press conference on Friday, pointing out that his captain \u201cvery rarely lets you down.\u201d Bruno Guimaraes scores his team\u2019s second goal against Fulham. Credit: Getty Images The midfielder proved his point at St James\u2019 Park. \u201cI feel unbelievable. We were very tired from Wednesday\u2019s game and I think we had to learn how to finish the game,\u201d Guimaraes said.",

Will they again team up to block these important reforms that will deliver better outcomes for our environment and for business?\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatt said Australia's laws \"remain broken\" nearly five years since Graeme Samuel tabled his report to then-environment minister Sussan Ley.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Samuel Review, handed to the Coalition government in 2020 and led by the former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chair, found Australia's national environmental laws were outdated and ineffective.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Federal government approves Woodside gas project extension, with some conditions\n\nOn Friday, Samuel told the ABC he was \"frustrated\" and \"frankly, a little angry\" about the Greens and Opposition's position on the proposed changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Opposition leader Ley called the reforms an \"environmental approvals disaster\" that would add layers of bureaucracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens leader Larissa Waters has criticised the proposal for doing \"little to protect nature\", and that the change \"weakens an already weak piece of legislation\".\n\n\n\n",

Everyone is known, and everyone is being picked up and swept along at their own pace.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it\u2019s rewarding work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Seeing someone realise that, yes, I can do this just watching their confidence grow throughout the program and seeing the possibilities the future possibilities open and expand, is the best part of the job.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGrant funding for the position comes through 26Ten, a Tasmanian program working to lift adult literacy and numeracy skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior literacy advisor at Libraries Tasmania, Iona Johnson, says 26TeN has worked with more than 4,000 learners since it started in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People generally come in with an idea of what it is that they're wanting to achieve in their life, and realising that literacy has kind of got in the way of them being able to achieve that. So they generally have some life goals that you know will tailor that learning around. So it might be about wanting to learn to read to their child. It might be about, you know, wanting to successfully pass a white card or a first aid certificate or do something towards repositioning themselves in terms of work.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data on adult literacy and numeracy levels comes from the OECD, under the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competences, or PIAAC.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figures show as many as one-in-five Australians have low levels of literacy or numeracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Approximately 14 per cent of people have literacy skill levels below level two, so at much lower levels, who are likely to experience a significant gap between what they're able to do and their ability to engage in everyday life. 21 per cent of people have that gap in terms of their numeracy skills.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThese figures were released more than 10 years ago, with those in the sector keen for an update to see what has \u2013 or hasn\u2019t \u2013 changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So the last survey was done in 2012 what the results came out in 2012 which is quite a long time now. It's very old data.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia temporarily withdrew from PIAAC but has since re-joined, with fresh data expected in 2029.\n\n\n\n\n\nJobs and Skills Australia is also conducting a national survey of adult literacy and numeracy skills, with those results due in late 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Cedrick Smith, a little help has opened up a lifelong career.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It could take me a lot of places. There's unrelated fields where they need work that involves a carpentry background. I'm not too sure yet, I'm sort of open to what's going to come next. I'll sort of wait and see.

It can also be helpful to close sun-facing windows and blinds during the day to prevent bedrooms from heating up.\n\n\n\nSleep experts also suggest drinking water regularly and avoiding caffeine, alcohol and heavy meals before bed.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a societal level, there are a number of ways to adapt and protect sleep, said Danny Eckert, a senior researcher on the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Urban design, housing, and public health strategies such as using heat-resilient housing designs and urban cooling strategies, such as green roofs, tree planting, and reflective building materials could help,\" he said.\n\n\n\nDisproportionate impact on less affluent populations\n\nOne limitation of the study was its reliance on data from costly sleep-tracking devices, which are more prevalent in wealthier countries, Toson noted.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, lower-income populations were likely underrepresented.\n\n\n\nThere's strong existing evidence that climate change hits poorer and more vulnerable communities hardest, exacerbating existing inequalities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It certainly affects those populations in a disproportionate way,\" Toson said, pointing to a lack of access to tools like air conditioning and cooler bedding.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, analysis by the Australia Institute found that extreme heat poses a greater threat to outer-urban and rural areas of the country, where vulnerable populations \u2014 including older people, those with chronic health conditions and people on lower incomes \u2014 are more concentrated.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Michael Mosley suffered from chronic insomnia.

        "text": "In the cafes of bustling Australian cities, queues form early in the morning as customers wait for their daily fix of matcha.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal demand for the carefully produced powdered green tea synonymous with Japan has surged in recent years, fuelled by millennials and gen Z consumers seeking healthier drink options.\n\n\n\n\n\nHip cafes around the world now feature matcha lattes, smoothies, and desserts as staples. In Australia, the matcha market generated more than $54 million in revenue in 2024, according to market research firm Grand View Research.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat figure is expected to grow at 7.1 per cent annually over the next five years. By 2030, revenue is projected to exceed $81 million \u2014 a $27 million increase.\n\n\n\nBut that rise in popularity is being met with challenges. Extreme heat and labour shortages in Japan have hit tea plantations hard, leading to a decline in matcha production and surging prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan's green tea exports to Australia reached 195,319 kg between January and August 2025, according to the Japanese Tea Export Promotion Council.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's a 131 per cent year-on-year increase, making Australia the eighth-largest export destination.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply has not kept up. The price of tencha, the raw leaf used for matcha, hit a record 8,235 yen/kg ($82/kg) at a May auction in Kyoto, up 170 per cent from a year earlier, according to the Global Japanese Tea Association.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Prices for matcha green tea set to jump by 70 per cent this year SBS News 00:54 English\n\nThose challenges have led some cafes in Australia to consider turning to another country to meet their matcha needs: China.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne cafe in Melbourne added Chinese matcha lattes to its menu alongside the traditional Japanese version when the shop opened in April.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Chinese matcha has a stronger, more bitter tea base, which makes it great for iced drinks or pairing with plant-based milk,\" the shop posted on social media in July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Japanese matcha, on the other hand, is sweeter and more delicate, ideal for hot drinks or pairing with dairy milk.\"\n\n\n\nMatcha's popularity is surging around the world, an opportunity for Chinese suppliers amid price hikes in the Japanese industry. Source: SBS News / Nicole Gong The cafe said it was the first in the city to offer the alternative \u2014 but it's unlikely to be the last.\n\n\n\n\n\nUmesh Kumar, who runs a cafe in Melbourne's South Yarra, is also considering a shift to serving Chinese matcha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of suppliers from China have approached me. I got 48 samples last month from China from different regions,\" the 29-year-old told SBS Chinese.\n\n\n\n\n\nKumar said the price of premium \"tier-one\" Japanese matcha has jumped from $390/kg to $500/kg in the past 12 months.\n\n\n\nMelbourne matcha cafe owner Umesh Kumar said his profit margins are shrinking as Japanese matcha prices soar. Source: SBS News / Nicole Gong His cafe uses about 120kg a month. While he's kept prices stable, his profit margins are shrinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the [Japanese matcha] pricing is going more than $600/kg, that means one cup's cost will be $5.80. It's not worth it to run at $9,\" he said. \"If nothing changes, Australians could be paying over $12 a cup soon.\"\n\n\n\nChina's matcha comeback\n\nZihan He, a social media influencer and Chinese tea culture insider, said the shortage of Japanese matcha offers \"a perfect alignment of timing, opportunity, and momentum\" for Chinese matcha to go global.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a gap in the low-end tea market because of Japan's supply shortage,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In 2023, China might not have been ready, but 2025 is different \u2014 many factories now receive strong subsidies to expand their matcha production lines.\"\n\n\n\nZihan He travels to different tea regions in China and globally to promote Chinese tea. Credit: Supplied While Japan's matcha enjoys international prestige, He pointed out that matcha actually originated in China.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt flourished during the Tang and Song dynasties through the diancha (whisked tea) tradition and was known as \"mocha\" before fading in popularity after the Ming dynasty, as tea-drinking customs changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Zen Buddhism spread to Japan, matcha-making techniques went with it, eventually developing into Japan\u2019s renowned tea ceremony culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, matcha is experiencing a revival in China, with major production hubs in the Zhejiang and Guizhou provinces.\n\n\n\nWhat are the key differences between Chinese and Japanese matcha?\n\nHe acknowledged that a quality gap remains. Japanese matcha has a bright, vivid green colour and a smooth, sweet taste, while Chinese matcha still tends to be darker and more bitter, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne key difference, she added, lies in shading \u2014 a vital process that boosts chlorophyll and amino acids, creating that signature green hue and mild flavour. Shading involves artificially reducing the amount of sun the tea bush is exposed to, usually via a canopy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Japan has centuries of experience and detailed data on how long shading should last in each region,\" she said. \"In China, we\u2019re still experimenting \u2014 for example, if farmers follow Japan\u2019s 20-day shading, it might make the tea too astringent at higher altitudes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, He remains optimistic: \"China may be slow from zero to one, but once it learns, it moves fast from one to one hundred.\"\n\n\n\nChange is brewing, but there's a sticking point\n\nFor cafe owners like Kumar, Chinese matcha's biggest appeal is price and scalability.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said tier-three Chinese matcha sells for around $80/kg, compared with $299/kg for Japanese matcha of a similar grade \u2014 nearly four times the price.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, taste remains a sticking point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Japanese matcha is thicker and creamier \u2026 on the other side, Chinese matcha still tastes grainy and bitter at this stage,\" Kumar said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe hasn't switched suppliers yet but is keeping an open mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Chinese matcha will play a bigger role [in Australia] if they come with the good quality and pricing,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm telling you, businesses are ready to switch.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nTiffany Leon is a dietitian from Maryland in the United States - and also the mum of two boys.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they were little, she followed a new guideline - first issued in the US in 2015 - to introduce peanuts to them at an early age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a dietitian, I practice evidence-based recommendations throughout my career, and so when someone told me, 'Oh this is this is how it's done now, these are the new guidelines', I just thought, 'Oh okay, well this is what we're gonna do then'... So around four, around five months we like sat him in the chair and fed him a few of the lower risk allergenic foods. I think we did like green beans, infant cereal, you know, did a few things first. And then we just jumped in with two feet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for this change in the Leon family is because up to that point, parents had been told to avoid exposing their children to potentially risky foods until they were three years old, in the hope of avoiding a full blown allergy.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeanut allergy is one of the most common of these conditions, caused when the body\u2019s immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger symptoms like hives, respiratory issues, and sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn that event, as this parent told SBS in August, it can become an all-consuming situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAllergies aren't just an inconvenience. They really do shape every aspect of families' lives.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNew guidance aimed at avoiding this kind of outcome came out in a number of countries after Gideon Lack at King\u2019s College London published the groundbreaking Learning Early About Peanut Allergy, or LEAP, trial, work that suggested earlier exposure might actually help children.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo says Dr David Hill, from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe LEAP study... showed that if we actually introduce that allergen to children by mouth, having them eat it, before they're introduced to it via their skin, we can reduce the risk that that child's going to go on to develop the food allergy itself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia's children appear to have avoided developing a peanut allergy - and now Dr Hill has published a new study after analysing electronic health records from dozens of paediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the new guidelines were issued.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's found thousands of other children in the US have also avoided developing peanut allergies after their parents followed the same dietary advice as the Leons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat our data shows is that because of, or at least associated with those early introduction guidelines, there's about 60,000 less kids with food allergy today than there would have been. And that's a remarkable thing, right? That's the size of some cities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Rachel Peters is the Population Health Research Program Lead at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute's National Allergy Centre of Excellence.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's been part of research at the Institute that's also exploring these issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the charity group Allergy and Anaphlyaxis Australia, peanut allergy is one of the most common food allergies in childhood in Australia, affecting 3 percent of infants up to the age of 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Peters says at least two major studies have been completed in Australia in the last decade to explore what might prevent such allergies in the first place - one study happening before Australia adopted new infant feeding guidelines in 2016, and one after that date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe had two population-based studies recruited in the same region, which was Melbourne, Australia... So we had two cohorts recruited with exactly the same methods, but 10 years apart... Firstly, we measured what parents were doing in terms of infant feeding practices and we had some very promising results showing that nearly 90 percent of babies today are being fed peanut in the first year of life, and this is what the guidelines currently recommend... (and secondly) we certainly showed a modest reduction in food allergy, but perhaps not as much as we were expecting.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Peters says the Australian findings suggest much more study needs to be done to establish the various causes of food allergies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEven though we are certainly starting to see a reduction in the rates of peanut allergy in Australia, they are still quite higher - and higher than in some other countries around the world, and higher than what was shown in this American study as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associate Professor says some of that research has offered some promising evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFor example, there is a large trial underway examining whether Vitamin D supplementation in the first year of life is helpful for preventing food allergy... There's a number of studies that show in babies who live further from the equator - so they're geting less exposure to Vitamin D and less sunlight - that they're more likely to develop a food allergy.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nUluru and Kata Tjuta are some of central Australia's most iconic landscapes, included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, and for the longest time, have been sacred sites of the Anangu people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey had been known by other names for decades, after European explorers renamed Kata Tjuta as Mount Olga, and Uluru as Ayers Rock, after South Australia\u2019s Chief Secretary, Sir Henry Ayers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1985, the traditional owners of Uluru found themselves at the centre of an historic moment, announced by then Governor General Sir Ninian Stephen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I now place in the hands of the Uluru Kata Tjuta Aboriginal Land Trust, the title deeds.\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe handback was a landmark moment for Aboriginal land rights in Australia and a powerful recognition of the enduring connection between First Nations peoples and Country.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the result of years of lobbying by the Central Land Council and Pitjantjatjara Council to recognise the rights of traditional owners, something the Northern Territory government had consistently resisted.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1985, Chief Minister Ian Tuxsworth argued that the territory government should have control, and that the Commissioner of the Territory's Land Court should decide on ownership, even though Uluru had been excluded from the Territory's Aboriginal Land Rights Act when it was declared the Uluru\u2013Kata Tjuta National Park in 1977.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat Commissioner has already determined that Uluru is not available for claim, and he's also not made any determination that there ARE traditional owners to the Uluru area. Now until those things are settled we are saying that the Aboriginal Land Rights Act has been subverted and changed for political convenience.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Territory government had accordingly lobbied for the title to be transferred to them - which the National Museum of Australia says would have resulted in a reduced title for the Anangu and no control in park management.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hawke government and Governor General believed otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\nSir Stephen said that would be rectified by the handback - and an agreement for the traditional owners to lease the park back to the government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trust by the deed which is to be handed over today acquires inalieable Australian law to this place, which is so special to its members... And at the same time, recognising the special significance of Uluru to all Australians, and the appropriateness of it remaining as an Australian national park, the Trust will today lease it back to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service as a national park.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the anniversary of that historic handback has been remembered 40 years on, with a public event at Talingu\u1e5fu Nyakunytjaku, the Ulu\u1e5fu sunrise viewing area, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the first commemorations took place weeks earlier, in early October, at London's Australia House.\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Commissioner to the UK Stephen Smith says the official event included nine traditional owners, dignitaries, and King Charles - who visited the site in 1983 during his tour of Australia with then wife Princess Diana.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe appears to have never forgotten his experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI remember when I went. At the different times of day it was extraordinary. The light. I didn't have time to get my paintbrush out.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry Wilson was among the Anangu representatives who made the trip to the UK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs you can see a picture of Uluru on the screen here, it brings us into tears, sadness and happiness as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Smith says the event itself was a significant one - not just because it's the first time in seven years that King Charles has visited Australia House.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNormally the palace looks at 50 or 100 year anniversaries, so the fact that we're doing this on the 40th anniversary tells you this was something special.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese offered some remarks to the official service at Australia House via a video message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a milestone in Aboriginal land rights in Australia, and a powerful moment in the story of our continent. Around the world, Uluru is instantly recognised as Australia. In Australia, it stands as a monument to a peoples' love for country and their determination to see justice done.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian High Commissioner also spoke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Anangu have lived in the area around Uluru-Kata Tjuta for more than 30,000 years. These places are among the most recognised and significant living cultural landscapes, where knowledge, language, song and ceremony have been passed down across countless generations.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJust like 40 years ago, when traditional songs and dances were performed as the handback took place, the anniversary has also included performances, this time by the nine Anangu Traditional Owners - some of whom had never visited the United Kingdom before.\n\n\n\n\n\nSammy Wilson says the song is from their grandmothers and grandfathers - and talks about the significance of the rock.\n\n\n\n",

The Londoners\u2019 lead was cancelled out by Wilson Isidor\u2019s equaliser in the 22nd minute when the Frenchman stabbed in from close range after Chelsea failed to deal with a long throw. The game appeared to be heading for a draw as Chelsea failed to find a way through the Black Cats\u2019 disciplined midfield and defensive lines. In the third minute of added time, however, Talbi collected a pass by fellow substitute Brian Brobbey and the Morocco winger placed his low shot perfectly for his first goal for Sunderland since signing from Club Brugge in July.\n\nSunderland coach Regis Le Bris said his players had found the right balance between pressing Chelsea high up the pitch in key moments before holding their deep blocking formation.

These are the games we want to play in and we can\u2019t use that as an excuse.\u201d Man United hang on to make it three wins in a row The crisis is over for Manchester United. For now at least.\n\nA third straight win in the Premier League finally has Ruben Amorim\u2019s team moving in the right direction, up to the heady heights of the top five on Saturday and with a sense of momentum not felt for a long time at Old Trafford. A 4-2 win against Brighton extended coach Amorim\u2019s best run of league wins since he was appointed last November. It was the first time United had won three in a row in England\u2019s top flight since February 2024. Victory also ended Brighton\u2019s winning streak in this fixture, which dated back three seasons. It is still too early to tell if Amorim has turned a corner after such a wretched start to his tenure, including the 20-time champion\u2019s worst-ever season in the Premier League last term.\n\nBut coming on the heels of last week\u2019s morale-boosting win at Liverpool, the signs are positive, even if Brighton sparked a fightback to make it a nervy finish for the home fans. A prime source of encouragement for Amorim is the manner in which his summer signings have added a new dimension. Brazil forward Matheus Cunha scored his first goal for the club with a curling shot from outside the area to give United a 24th-minute lead. Manchester United\u2019s Bryan Mbeumo, front, celebrates scoring his side\u2019s third goal with teammates. Credit: AP Bryan Mbeumo also scored twice in the second half, making it three in his last two games, after Casemiro had doubled the lead with a deflected effort before the break.\n\nIt was a former United player, Danny Welbeck, who gave Brighton hope with a brilliant free kick that flew into the top corner and when substitute Charalampos Kostoulas headed another goal in time added on, the tension rose inside the stadium. Then came Mbeumo\u2019s second to snuff out any chance of a collapse and ensure the winning streak continued. Thrilling late win for Newcastle United over Fulham Newcastle United\u2019s dramatic late 2-1 Premier League win over Fulham on Saturday may prove more than just three points \u2014 it could be the emotional spark their season needs, said United boss Eddie Howe. Bruno Guimaraes\u2019 90th-minute strike rescued the Magpies from what looked like a damaging draw, and Howe believes the timing of the goal could have a ripple effect.\n\n\u201cLate goals don\u2019t just affect the game you\u2019ve won, they affect mood and belief going forward,\u201d Howe said. \u201cIt can have a big knock-on effect. We\u2019ve had heartbreak the other way. This felt like a massive moment for us. We found a way to win.\u201d Newcastle\u2019s win was just their third of the season and saw them climb provisionally to 10th in the table. Howe wants more though after last season\u2019s fifth-place finish and a League Cup victory.\n\nThe Magpies were looking to get their league campaign back on track after last weekend\u2019s disappointing 2-1 loss at Brighton and Hove Albion, but were buoyed by their emphatic 3-0 Champions League victory over Benfica midweek. Howe had talked of reigniting Newcastle\u2019s Premier League push \u2014 and his side backed up that ambition with a purposeful start with Jacob Murphy scoring in the 18th minute. Bruno Guimaraes celebrates his winning goal. Credit: Getty Images Sasa Lukic drew the visitors level in the 56th minute and the game looked to be heading towards a draw before Guimaraes\u2019 late-game heroics. Substitute William Osula drove to the edge of the box, but his shot was parried into the path of Guimaraes by goalkeeper Bernd Leno, and the Brazilian poked it in from close range.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one I\u2019ll remember, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Howe said. \u201cYou always remember when you win late, and it was a priceless win for us ... a big three points.\u201d Howe had praised Guimaraes\u2019 durability in logging thousands of miles to play for club and country in his pre-game press conference on Friday, pointing out that his captain \u201cvery rarely lets you down.\u201d Bruno Guimaraes scores his team\u2019s second goal against Fulham. Credit: Getty Images The midfielder proved his point at St James\u2019 Park. \u201cI feel unbelievable.
