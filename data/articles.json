        "text": "Children who catch COVID-19 are at risk of contracting dangerous heart inflammation, but don't face the same danger from getting vaccinated against the virus, a new, large-scale study has found.\n\nThe report in The Lancet Child & Adolescent Health examined the health records of nearly every child in the United Kingdom between 2020 and 2022 \u2013 almost 14 million under-18-year-olds.\n\nIt found there was a small but still significant risk of children developing serious heart conditions like myocarditis or pericarditis in the six months after catching COVID-19.\n\nREAD MORE: Aussie skincare products pulled from shelves over banned ingredient \ufeff\n\nA new study has found children face far less risk of heart inflammation from COVID-19 vaccination than infection. (Eddie Jim/The Age)\n\nHowever, the authors found the risk of rare heart complications after receiving the Pfizer vaccine for the virus was \"substantially lower\".\n\n\"The risk is still there after vaccination, but it is around half of the risk faced due to acute infection with the disease itself,\" paediatrician Dr Michelle Scoullar from the Burnet Institute said.\n\n\"We know that repeated infection with COVID-19 is common for children, and this study has added to the evidence that these acute infections are putting their health at risk, this study shows that vaccination substantially decreases this risk, even in those who get a mild infection.\n\n\"That's an important reassurance for parents weighing up the benefits and risks.\"\n\nProfessor Raina MacIntyre, an emerging infectious disease expert at the University of NSW, said the research only further emphasised that mRNA vaccines are safe to use.\n\nMore than 7 million people have been killed by COVID-19. (NIAID-RML via AP)\n\n\"This study confirms what many other studies have shown - that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are safe and effective in reducing the risks of serious complications of COVID infection,\" she said.\n\n\"No vaccine or drug is 100 per cent safe, as all have side effects, but they go through a rigorous process to ensure that the benefits far outweigh the risks.\n\n\"This study and other studies show the risk-benefit clearly favours vaccines for children. The risk of myocarditis is low \u2013 1-3 per 100,000 children.\n\n\"There is a much higher risk of myocarditis after COVID infection\u2026 the COVID mRNA vaccines are actually protective of the heart, because of the enormous damage the infection can cause to the heart.\"\n\nIn Australia, COVID-19 vaccinations aren't recommended for children unless they are immunocompromised or have risk factors that increase their chance of contracting severe illness after infection.\n\nAnother study previously found COVID-19 vaccines had saved at least 14 million lives. (Jenny Evans/Getty Images)\n\nBut following the study, MacIntyre said health authorities should change their stance.\n\n\"That we deny vaccination to children is inexplicable\u2026 our children are not eligible for vaccination at all, and vaccination is not even recommended wholeheartedly even for young adults,\" she said.\n\n\"Long COVID is another crippling impact on everyone, especially kids and working-age adults\u2026 I hope this study will inform vaccine policy for children.\"\n\nMater Health Services director of infectious diseases Professor Paul Griffin agreed.\n\n\"COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for children remain controversial, due to many different and conflicting positions regarding the need to vaccinate particularly children with no associated risk factors,\" he said.\n\n\"While more severe disease from COVID-19 infection is known to be more associated with advanced age and comorbidities, this study provides further evidence both of the significant complications of COVID-19 infection in children and the relative safety of the vaccines that therefore could, or perhaps should, be more widely recommended to reduce these risks.\"\n\nDOWNLOAD THE 9NEWS APP : Stay across all the latest in breaking news, sport, politics and the weather via our news app and get notifications sent straight to your smartphone.

(Choice)\n\nCommonwealth Bank\n\nCommonwealth Bank was among the \"winners\" this year, \ufefffor what Choice described as \"making bank off the back of Australia's poorest\".\n\n\"Earlier this year, CommBank was one of the major banks ASIC caught charging low-income customers excessive fees, when they were eligible for low or no-fee accounts,\" de Silva said.\n\n\"In CommBank's case, 2.2 million customers were collectively charged $270 million in unfair fees.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Two men sought over spate of antisemitic graffiti attacks \ufeff\n\nCBA received not just a Shonky but a \"special\" award. (Eamon Gallagher)\n\nDe Silva also said Commonwealth Bank initially refused to issue refunds, before deciding to consider them on a case-by-case basis.\n\nHe said this award, the bank's fourth, marked it as \"the most awarded Australian company in Shonkys history\". \ufeff\n\nIn response to this year's \"award\", Commonwealth Bank said in a statement they were \"committed to making banking fair and accessible for customers\".\n\n\"In July, we committed to making goodwill adjustments where appropriate to customers who have incurred unusually high fees,\" the statement read.\n\n\"For eligible concession customers, we have paused certain fees, including overdraw and monthly account-keeping fees.\n\n\"Following ASIC's Better Banking for Indigenous Consumers report, we made approximately $25 million in goodwill payments to approximately 87,000 accounts.\ufeff\"\n\nEnergy retailers\n\nDe Silva said energy retailers collectively were receiving a Shonky this year for \"sneaky pricing tactics designed to confuse customers\".\n\n\"We've seen a number of retailers roll out new, cheaper plans with the exact same name as existing plans,\" he said.\n\nEnergy providers received a collective award. (iStock)\n\n\"As a result, many consumers were led to believe they were already on the best plan as their current plan name was identical \u2013 potentially missing out on savings as a result.\"\n\nChoice estimated customers could have saved a collective $65 million a year if the distinctions between plans had been clearer.\n\nTemu\n\nSuper-popular online marketplace Temu received a Shonky for \"being an unsafe haven for dodgy sales tactics and fast fashion\".\n\n\"Its customer service leaves much to be desired, purchases can take a very long time to arrive, and it's often difficult to get refunds,\" de Silva said.\n\n\"Temu is also one of the biggest drivers of fast fashion, selling poorly made clothes at cheap prices.\"\n\nHowever, de Silva said safety was \"perhaps the biggest issue\" with the marketplace.\n\n\"In 2024, CHOICE purchased and tested 15 randomly selected coin- and button battery-operated products from Temu, with every product tested failing at least one requirement of Australian button battery regulations designed to keep children safe,\" he said.\n\n\"While all 15 items have been removed from sale, Temu has continued to make headlines for safety issues.\"\n\nTemu has taken the global ecommerce market by storm (Adobe Stock)\n\nHe cited the case of an eight-year-old girl in Queensland who suffered burns when a hoodie she was wearing, purchased off Temu, was set alight by sparks from a firepit.\ufeff\n\nThe ACCC found the hoodie breached safety standards as it had no fire warning label.\n\n\"Four months later, Temu recalled the hoodie, but the damage had already been done,\" de Silva said.\n\n\"To make matters worse, Temu has still failed to join a number of other online marketplaces in signing up to the voluntary Product Safety Pledge, designed to do more to protect consumers.\"\n\nA Temu spokesperson said customer safety was a \"top priority\" and that the vast majority of the marketplace's shoppers reported positive experiences.\n\n\"We've invested significantly in compliance measures, including robust seller vetting, pre-listing checks and ongoing monitoring using both automated systems and human review,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"We act swiftly to remove listings when there is a concern. In the incidents cited by CHOICE, all affected items were promptly removed, and we've since further strengthened oversight in higher-risk categories.\"\n\nTemu does not manufacture the goods for sale on its website, but provides a platform for vendors.\ufeff\n\nHealth insurer HCF\n\nHCF Health Insurance was accused by Choice of orchestrating \"a price rise in disguise\".\n\n\"We're giving HCF a Shonky Award this year for purposefully bypassing the government approval process for health insurance premium increases on existing policies \u2013 sneakily closing an existing policy, and opening a new policy with almost identical cover, but a significantly higher price,\" de Silva said.\n\n\"This year, HCF closed its Premium Gold policy to new members, instead releasing a nearly identical policy called 'Optimal Gold' with a whopping 34.6 per cent price increase \u2013 no government approval required.\"\n\nInsurer HCF also came under fire. (A Current Affair)\n\nAn HCF spokesperson said the company had \"updated its product and pricing structure for new Gold policy sales\" to keep Gold-level protection \"accessible, equitable, and sustainable\".\n\n\"These changes apply only to new sales and are in full compliance with industry standards and regulations. Premium Gold products purchased prior to February 2025 remain unchanged,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Since updating our Gold product offering, we've engaged in regular constructive discussions to address concerns and will comply with any future changes in legislation or regulation.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said the challenges reflected broader sector pressures driven by higher costs from complex claims, particularly those involving mental health.\n\n\"Our goal is to maintain comprehensive protection for those who need it most while ensuring value for all members,\" they said.\n\n\"Over the last decade, we have returned 89 cents of every dollar in premiums as benefits to members \u2013 higher than the industry average of 84 cents.\ufeff\"\n\nAustralia's most trusted brands for 2025 revealed View Gallery\n\nHandy heater?\n\nThe final Shonky for the year went to the Handy Heater Turbo 800, which de Silva said was \"a plug-in heater that doesn't plug in\".\n\n\"In Australia, all electric devices must have a plug that fits directly into an Australian power point. To plug this heater into an Australian socket, you'd need an adaptor \u2013 but that's just strike one,\" he said.\n\n\"The travel adaptor that came with the heater also wasn't compliant, leaving pins exposed when plugged into an Australian power point.\n\n\"Other safety issues included a lack of any kind of thermal protection device, insecure wiring, and a heating element directly mounted onto thermoplastic \u2013 a material that becomes soft when heated.\"\n\nDe Silva also claimed that according to Choice testing, the heater didn't produce \"anywhere near\" as much heat as its advertising suggested.",

(Supplied)\n\nMr Sumption said he decided to enquire about filtration with water treatment company Puretec last year and sent a sample of his tap water for testing.\n\n\"I rang up the water treatment mob and they said I had to test the water to find out what sort of filter I needed,\" Mr Sumption said.\n\n\"When the results came back, I was told the water was not fit for human consumption.\"\n\nThe Water Corporation said it was aware of water filtration companies that were active in the area.\n\n\"As part of their sales pitch, these companies often perform rudimentary testing of tap water,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"From past experience, the results provided to residents can differ wildly from the verified quality of water supplied to meter.\n\n\"This is an unscrupulous sales tactic.\"\n\nPuretec sales engineer Burke Stacey said discrepancies could occur between the meter and water delivered at the tap, but testing was not a sales tactic.\n\n\"We referred the client back to Water Corporation because we noted a disparity between our results and theirs,\" Mr Stacey said.\n\nFurther upgrades\n\nShortly after the upgrades, Cue was named as having the state's best tasting tap water.\n\nHowever, Shire President Les Price said issues remained and upgrading pipe systems could help.\n\nLes Price says water pipeline upgrades would help water quality. (ABC Midwest Wheatbelt: Rachael Clifford)\n\n\"A big part of the problem that does exist is in relation to the pipes and delivery systems of water into the town and into the homes,\" he said.\n\n\"An upgrade on the piping system within the town sites will improve water over time.\"\n\nSandstone Shire President Beth Walton agreed an infrastructure update may be needed.\n\nAlthough she said residents' reactions to the water varied.\n\n\"All we can do is be in touch with the Water Corp and make sure those standards are delivered to us,\" she said.\n\nA Water Corperation spokesperson said pipeline infrastructure in Cue and Sandstone were within their expected asset lifespan and did not have faults which would require them to be replaced.",

Australia's first Test Ashes squad Steve Smith (captain) Sean Abbott Scott Boland Alex Carey (wk) Brendan Doggett Cameron Green Josh Hazlewood Travis Head Josh Inglis Usman Khawaja Marnus Labuschagne Nathan Lyon Mitch Starc Jake Weatherald Beau Webster We'll wrap it up there In short, Sam Konstas has been dropped, Jake Weatherald is a chance to open, but whether he does likely depends on how Cameron Green bowls in the Shield for WA next week. Marnus Labuschagne is back, Sean Abbott and Brendan Doggett are both in contention for a quick bowler slot. Three uncapped players, Weatherald, Abbott and Doggett. Plenty of experience. Plenty of hype ahead of the Ashes. Khawaja under pressure, perhaps i am surprised of the selection of Jake Weatherald becuase of his recent form hasnt been amazing, but i think Mat Renshaw will fill in Usman Khawaja spot once he retires. - Sam Khawaja has not been amazing in recent series for Australia. Should he fail a couple of times in this series, you do wonder whether there will be some calls for a tough decision to be made.

I feel like at the moment if he farts, it's a headline,\" Bailey said.\n\n\"There's a handful of young guys his age playing Shield cricket around the country and they're all learning \u2026 Sammy's no different, he just happens to be doing it under immense scrutiny.\n\n\"We really like him. We like the skill set there and we're confident that will continue to build out.\"\n\nSkipper Pat Cummins has already been ruled out of contention due to a back injury, with Steve Smith set to captain the side.\n\nCummins said he hopes to be fit in time for the second Test in Brisbane on December 4.\n\nGeorge Bailey announced the Australian squad on the Gold Coast. (Getty Images: Robert Cianflone)\n\nEngland named its 16-man squad for the Ashes tour in September, led by Ben Stokes and a battery of injury-prone fast bowlers including Jofra Archer and Mark Wood.\n\nThe Ashes gets underway at Perth Stadium on November 21, followed by Tests in Brisbane (December 4-8), Adelaide (December 17-21), Melbourne (December 26-30) and Sydney (January 4-8).\n\nAustralia has never played England in a Test match at Perth Stadium but has an overall record of four wins and one defeat in its five Tests at the venue since 2018.\n\nEngland has only ever won a single Test in 14 attempts in Perth, a 166-run victory at the W.A.C.A. in 1978.\n\nAustralia has been victorious on 10 occasions in Western Australia against the English, with three draws.\n\nEngland have not won a Test match on Australian soil since 2011.\n\nAustralia's Ashes squad (first Test): Steve Smith (c), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey (wk), Brendan Doggett, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis (wk), Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitch Starc, Jake Weatherald, Beau Webster.\n\nEngland's Ashes squad: Ben Stokes (c), Harry Brook (vc), Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Shoaib Bashir, Jacob Bethell, Brydon Carse, Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Ollie Pope, Matthew Potts, Joe Root, Jamie Smith (wk), Josh Tongue, Mark Wood.",

The previous youngest was Youssoufa Moukoko, a striker who played for Borussia Dortmund just 18 days after his 16th birthday back in 2020.\n\nDowman's latest exploit came weeks after he became the second-youngest player \u2014 behind Arsenal teammate Ethan Nwaneri \u2014 to feature in the Premier League after making his debut against Leeds, also as a second-half substitute in August.\n\nStill a school kid, Dowman has also come on as a replacement at defending champion Liverpool in the league this season and featured in two English League Cup matches.\n\nArsenal was leading 3-0 when Dowman came on to replace Leandro Trossard in the 72nd minute against Slavia.

        "text": "When Peter O'Shannessy returned to his home from the hospital in January, he was unable to speak or eat after extensive surgery for throat cancer.\n\nThe 74-year-old was assessed for aged care support and approved for a level-three home care package, which would fund a recliner to make him more comfortable, a suction machine to clear his airways and a personal carer to help him with showers and hygiene.\n\nThe family soon learned they had to join a national queue of 121,000 people to receive a package \u2014 and that it would be seven to nine months before any help arrived.\n\nPeter O'Shannessy was initially approved for a home care package that included funding for a recliner to make him more comfortable. (Supplied)\n\nWhen the cancer returned months later, Peter was declared terminal and needed urgent nursing care.\n\nThe family was advised to get a reassessment in the hope he could get the much-needed support.\n\n\"Dad's needs were increasing by the moment,\" his daughter, Eloise Randall, said.\n\n\"We needed personal care assistance, we needed nursing.\"\n\nEloise Randall says when her father's cancer returned, he needed urgent nursing care. (Supplied)\n\nThe government agency My Aged Care referred the family to Aspire4Life, the organisation that would do the reassessment.\n\nIt was one of more than a dozen companies contracted by the federal government late last year to take over aged care assessments.\n\nFor the past 40 years, it's been Aged Care Assessment Teams (ACAT), based with state and territory health departments, who have done assessments and decided on the level of care needed.\n\nBut in December last year, the government partially privatised the system at a cost of more than $1.2 billion.\n\nLatest figures show there are now more than 116,000 people waiting for aged care assessments around the country.\n\nDo you know more? If you have a story to tell, email Anne Connolly on Connolly.Anne@abc.net.au\n\non If you require more secure communication, please choose an option on the confidential tips page\n\nEloise said she spent hours on the phone to both My Aged Care and Aspire4Life, begging for support.\n\n\"Aspire4Life gave mum and dad a reassessment date of eight weeks into the future, and that was the most urgent time they could get there,\" Eloise said.\n\n'I warned and warned them, he'll be gone.\"\n\nPeter died four weeks before his urgent reassessment.\n\n\"In the end, Dad had gone from messaging banter in our family WhatsApp chat to sending my mum a text message saying 'help',\" Eloise said.\n\n\" He was suffering a catastrophic bleed and haemorrhage that my mum had to deal with all on her own. \"\n\n\"Within 20 minutes, my dad was gone.\"\n\nEloise Randall says she didn't believe her father could last the eight weeks until his reassessment. (ABC News: Andrew Ware)\n\n\"He spent his last couple of weeks feeling like he was drowning, lying on a couch that was unsuitable for him and in a lot of fear and anxiety, and my mum spent those last few weeks absolutely burnt out and exhausted, caring for someone on her own with no support, despite hours and days and weeks of us just on the phone to these people,\" said Eloise through tears.\n\nAspire4Life, a not-for-profit, was responsible for an assessment for support services for Peter, not his medical care.\n\nIn a statement, the organisation said it couldn't comment on Peter's case because of its \"contract with the government\" but said the \"high demand for government subsidised aged care assessment services is universally acknowledged\".\n\nIt said it was investing to meet the additional demand and had provided more than 100,000 services in the preceding 12 months.\n\nFamilies at breaking point\n\nIn Cairns, former ACAT assessor Coral Wilkinson now helps families navigate the aged care maze, dealing with a range of assessment organisations in Queensland.\n\nShe says many clients are calling her for help to try to get an assessment done more quickly.\n\n\"People have already been waiting months. Some are waiting nine or 10 months for an assessment,\" she said.\n\n\"They're desperate. They ring us in tears. Some end up in hospital or a nursing home because they can't get support at home.\"\n\nFormer assessor Coral Wilkinson says she regularly receives calls from families distressed about wait times for assessments. (ABC News: Stuart Ireland)\n\nCoral believes the Department of Health and some of the newly contracted companies weren't prepared.\n\n\"I believe the workforce wasn't ready,\" she said.\n\n\"I think there was some naivety on the part of the department and perhaps some of the newer assessing organisations who didn't really understand the level of knowledge and expertise that is required to assess older people who \u2026 have higher and more complex needs.\"\n\nThe government doesn\u2019t agree that people are waiting a long time.\n\nA spokesperson for the Aged Care Minister, Sam Rae, said the median wait time for aged care assessments was 23 days in the July-September quarter and that the government would \u201ccontinue to focus on bringing down wait times even further\u201d.\n\nThree phone calls and you're out\n\nJanine Mason, a former clinical assessor, joined one of the new private assessment companies \u2013 not Aspire4Life \u2013 early this year but quit after a few months, saying she felt under pressure to do assessments quickly.\n\n\"I think the assessments now are actually becoming dehumanised because of the pressure to get them done.\"\n\n\"It's coming from departmental decisions that are pushing down onto the companies that must remain viable and keep their contracts.\"\n\nJanine Mason says assessors were under pressure to get assessments done because of the long wait list. (ABC News: Chris Gillette)\n\nMost disturbing for Janine was a practice that she claims meant elderly people dropped off the waiting list \u2014 often without their knowledge \u2014 if they didn't respond to phone calls in time.\n\n\"There are obviously KPIs about how much time can be spent trying to contact the older person. We were advised three calls were to be given.\n\n\"If they don't respond to those calls, then that referral would be rejected,\" she said.\n\nJanine's former employer said that although there were guidelines allowing assessors to reject clients if unsuccessful after several attempts, their organisation didn't adopt this policy and went to significant lengths to contact clients.\n\nThe ABC has spoken to workers and families who say they have also encountered this practice at other organisations.\n\nRoyal commission didn't recommend privatisation\n\nWhen the aged care royal commission reported in 2021, it recommended a streamlining of aged care assessments into a single assessment scheme, but it didn't recommend privatisation.\n\nIt also said that assessments should be done by people \"independent from approved providers\".\n\nThis would ensure there would not be any perceived conflict of interest for assessors who would have contact with clients and could potentially gain an advantage by recommending a provider's services.\n\nDespite that recommendation, the ABC can reveal that more than half of those companies contracted to provide assessments are also service providers or are a related entity to providers.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Rae's spokesperson said the government had \u201crobust arrangements to prevent conflicts\u201d and said the Department of Health was able to take a range of strict actions, including terminating contracts, if a conflict was identified.\n\nIn a tender document, the government put in a dozen KPIs, including that 90 per cent of urgent assessments should be done within 10 days and that 95 per cent of assessments should be face-to-face.\n\nBut last month at Senate Estimates, the department admitted that it would not be enforcing the requirement to meet KPI obligations for 12 months.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson said: \"The Department is taking a flexible approach to enforcing those KPIs for approximately 12 months following the establishment date.\"\n\nOlder Australians to pay for home care changes Older Australians entering the aged care system will have to pay for \"non-clinical\" services such as showers and help with medication under wide-ranging changes taking effect in November.\n\nPeter's family is still grieving the traumatic final months of his life.\n\nThey fear for others who don't have family support.\n\n\"I really despair for the number of vulnerable elderly Australians in this country who have no access to support or someone coming in to check on them,\" Eloise Randall said.\n\n\"It's probably too hard to sit on the phone and navigate the bureaucracy that is the system.\"\n\n\"Dad's final wish was to speak again. I think this process shows we had to speak for him, and we still got nowhere.\"\n\nWatch 7.30, Mondays to Thursdays 7:30pm on ABC iview and ABC TV",

        "text": "Sussan Ley has sought to hose down speculation she will soon be toppled as opposition leader, saying she is \"completely confident\" she will still be in the job in two months.\n\nInternal tensions have erupted since the National Party formally moved to dump its commitment to net zero at the weekend, sparking feverish questions about whether the Coalition could come to an agreement over the policy.\n\nMs Ley's detractors have since said a leadership challenge in the new year was \"almost unavoidable\", even if the party's first female leader was able to find a way through the climate debate.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, Ms Ley was on the defensive, addressing the unrest in her ranks with largely similar talking points across four separate on-air media interviews.\n\nAsked directly how sure she was that she would still be leader by the end of the year, Ms Ley said she was \"completely confident\".\n\nLiberals shifting towards dumping net zero The centre of debate inside the Liberals appears to be shifting towards dumping net zero, following the Nationals' decision to formally abandon the 2050 target.\n\n\"I have a smile on my face as I answer this, because I know that the media and commentary does get a little bit excited from time to time,\" she told ABC radio.\n\nIn a separate interview a short time later, Ms Ley was coy on whether her party would follow the Nationals in dumping the climate commitment, an outcome that some in the party have said was likely.\n\nThe party will meet to determine its position within a fortnight, meaning a decision before the end of the parliamentary year.\n\n\"I said when I became leader that we would not have a zero at any cost,\" Ms Ley told the ABC.\n\nBut she reiterated that she would not make \"captain's calls\" and that the Liberal Party would soon come to and announce its decision.\n\n\"Then I'll sit down with Nationals and work out a Coalition position together,\" she said.\n\n\"The process has been good. It's allowed us to come together and to talk, not just to each other, but to industry and experts.\"\n\nOn the topic of her colleagues backgrounding speculation over her leadership to the media, she again reiterated an oft-used line that she welcomed members of her party talking passionately about topics that mattered to them.\n\n\"This is actually not about me,\" she said.\n\n\"While commentary likes to focus on individuals and personalities, I've never seen it like that.\n\n\"It is about developing a serious, credible policy agenda.\"\n\nSenior Liberal says debate a distraction\n\nThe Liberal Party is split over the commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050, with moderates warning that they cannot credibly ditch the target, while the party's right flank has pushed to follow in the Nationals' footsteps.\n\nAmid the schism, conservative firebrand Andrew Hastie and former shadow treasurer Angus Taylor have emerged as the most likely challengers if a spill occurs in the near future.\n\nSenior Liberal conservative James Patterson backed in Ms Ley during a concurrent interview on Wednesday morning, as he declined to ventilate his own views on net zero because he was a member of her leadership team.\n\nBut he warned that it was \"critical\" that the net zero issue was resolved quickly, so the opposition could turn its attention to the government's performance.\n\n\"Frankly, the energy policy has been relatively unexamined in recent times because we have been distracted,\" he told the ABC.\n\nMr Paterson, who is the shadow finance minister, acknowledged that his party had not yet articulated its policy position on energy to the public because \"we're still resolving these big issues internally\".\n\n\"We have to articulate that argument and that's why resolving these issues is a prerequisite to having that debate with the government,\" he said.\n\n\"And we will have a burden on us to demonstrate what our alternative policy vision is to bring electricity prices down. And I assure you, we will do that.\"\n\nLey labels late-term abortion comments 'insensitive'\n\nThe opposition leader also used the media opportunity to rebuke comments by a number of Coalition backbenchers during debate over laws designed to ensure women who suffered stillbirth or early infant loss had access to maternity leave.\n\nAndrew Hastie, Henry Pike, Tony Pasin and Barnaby Joyce all used speeches in the parliament last Wednesday to suggest the laws, known as Priya's Bill, could have \"unintended consequences\", including in cases of late-term abortions.\n\nMs Ley did not name the politicians directly, but said comments referencing other circumstances were \"insensitive\".\n\n\"We should be supporting women through tragic events where a baby is lost. Losing a baby is one of the most difficult things that can ever happen to a mother and to a family,\" she said.\n\n\"As a mother and a grandmother, this is very personal.\n\n\" So any commentary about this bill applying in other contexts is insensitive. \"\n\nIt was the first time she had addressed the commentary around the laws, which the Coalition supported, but stressed that she was not \"not talking about individuals in my party room or individual comments\".\n\n\"It's a very difficult thing for a lot of women to talk about and the last thing I'm going to do is issue judgements on mothers and certainly, I'm very supportive of the bill as is my team,\" she said.",

Her collected diaries will surely be mentioned alongside The Diary of Virginia Woolf.\"\n\nFellow judge Rachel Lloyd, deputy culture editor of The Economist, described the volume as \"fascinating and compelling\".\n\n\"They're shimmering fragments, but together, they make a scintillating whole. She reflects on being a mother, being a wife, and above all, being a writer.\n\n\"You wouldn't think that diaries would be so readable and fluid, and yet Helen Garner has managed it.\"\n\n\"I like hearing what people make of their own lives in retrospect,\" Garner said of the appeal of the diary format. (Supplied: Text Publishing)\n\nA surprising win\n\nGarner, 82, is the author of many non-fiction works, including The First Stone (1995), a 2016 essay collection Everywhere I Look, and The Season (2024), which followed the fortunes of her grandson's football team over one year.\n\nTwo of her books featured in ABC Radio National's Top 100 Books of the 21st Century: This House of Grief (2014), which came in at number 88, and Joe Cinque's Consolation (2004), number 61.\n\nGarner is also known for her fiction, including her 1977 debut, Monkey Grip, which was adapted into a 1982 film starring Noni Hazlehurst and Colin Friels, and for which she wrote the screenplay.\n\nShe went on to write four more novels: Moving Out (1983), The Children's Bach (1984), Cosmo Cosmolino (1992), and The Spare Room (2008), which was recently adapted for the stage by the Belvoir Theatre Company.\n\nGarner initially published her diaries in three volumes: Yellow Notebook: Diaries Volume I 1978\u20131987 (2019), One Day I'll Remember This: Diaries 1987\u20131995 (2020) and How To End A Story: Diaries 1995\u20131998 (2021).\n\n\"It's a big book but Garner is such good company \u2014 funny, original, clever, self-lacerating, always interesting \u2014 that we didn't want the story to end,\" Millen said. (Supplied)\n\nThe collected diaries, now published together, span 20 years and offer remarkable insights into the author's writing process and her personal life, including her relationship with fellow author Murray Bail and their split.\n\nAlso featured in the diaries is Garner's reaction to the backlash that followed the publication of The First Stone, about a sexual harassment case at an Australian university.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Garner reflected on her surprise at winning a literary award for her diary.\n\n\"In a sense I never expected anyone else would read it, let alone it would become a book people would consider for a prize,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking to Baillie Gifford, Garner flagged her ambivalence about publishing subsequent volumes of her diaries.\n\n\" It's quite a gruelling process publishing a diary, because you see all the awful things about yourself, and you have to take them into account. \"\n\nWhile Garner has long been revered in Australia, winning the Melbourne Prize for Literature in 2006, she has only recently earned international acclaim.\n\nIn 2016, she won the Windham Campbell Prize for non-fiction, worth $AU230,000, for her body of work; and in 2023, her novel The Children's Bach (1984) and non-fiction book This House of Grief (2014) were released in the US for the first time.\n\nIn August, British pop star Dua Lipa featured This House of Grief, about the murder trial of Robert Farquharson, as her book club's monthly read, while Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie Bradshaw was spotted reading the same book in the final season of And Just Like That\u2026\n\nGarner's book about the Erin Patterson murder trial, The Mushroom Tapes: Conversations on a Triple Murder Trial, with fellow writers Chloe Hooper and Sarah Krasnostein, is due out on November 11.\n\nA run of Australians\n\nGarner beat a shortlist of five British authors, including two past finalists, whose works also explore the writing life: Frances Wilson, for her biography of author Muriel Spark; and Richard Holmes, for his biography of Alfred Lord Tennyson as a young poet.\n\nThe Baillie Gifford Prize shortlist The Revolutionists: The Story of the Extremists Who Hijacked the 1970s by Jason Burke\n\nHow to End a Story: Collected Diaries by Helen Garner\n\nThe Boundless Deep: Young Tennyson, Science and the Crisis of Belief by Richard Holmes\n\nCaptives and Companions: A History of Slavery and the Slave Trade in the Islamic World by Justin Marozzi\n\nLone Wolf: Walking the Faultlines of Europe by Adam Weymouth\n\nElectric Spark: The Enigma of Muriel Spark by Frances Wilson\n\nThis marks the second year in a row the Baillie Gifford Prize has been won by an Australian.\n\nIn 2024, the award went to Richard Flanagan for his hybrid work Question 7, however the Tasmanian author declined the prize money due to the major sponsor's investment in fossil fuels.\n\nIn a pre-recorded speech, Flanagan highlighted the effects of the climate crisis on the Tasmanian wilderness, where he was hiking at the time of the announcement.\n\n\"Were I not to speak of the terrifying impact fossil fuels are having on my island home, that same vanishing world that spurred me to write Question 7, I would be untrue to the spirit of my book,\" he said.\n\n\"The world is complex. These matters are difficult. None of us are clean. All of us are complicit. Major booksellers that sell my books are owned by oil companies, major publishers that publish my friends are owned by fascists and authoritarians \u2026\n\n\" As each of us is guilty, each of us too bears a responsibility to act. \"\n\nIn 2023, Australian historian Christopher Clark also made the shortlist for Revolutionary Spring, a snapshot of political unrest in 1848.",

(Supplied: Scott Baxter)\n\nLocal community 'divide'\n\nHalf of the residents surveyed as part of Synergy's submission to the EPA were \"extremely supportive\" of the proposed wind farm, while a third of the remaining respondents were strongly opposed to it.\n\n\"The proposed wind farm at Scott River does have the potential to drive some division in attitudes with the local community,\" Synergy's societal values assessment report noted.\n\nEmma Pinnick is a member of the No Wind Turbines - Scott River group, and said the decision by some local farmers to host turbines on their land had raised tensions in the community.\n\n\"I'm friends with some of those farmers that actually put their hand up for the turbines,\" she said.\n\n\" It's been really quite difficult. It's causing a lot of community divide. \"\n\nThe proposed wind farm would have 20 turbines capable of generating up to 100 megawatts of power in total. (ABC News: Charles Brice)\n\nMs Pinnick said she was concerned the turbines would impact the town's ability to attract new residents and tourists.\n\n\"They're coming here for the natural beauty of the bushland and the bird life on the river,\" she said.\n\n\"Especially in areas where you have the views, realtors have to disclose [the potential turbines] so when there's been potential buyers, that's been a concern.\"\n\nMs Pinnick claims ratepayers had not been properly consulted by the state-owned energy provider.\n\nA Synergy spokesperson said it had undertaken comprehensive community consultation as part of feasibility studies, which included community drop-in sessions, a survey, and regular meetings with landowners and community groups.\n\nWind farm opponents have formed a lobby group. (Supplied: Emma Pinnick)\n\nAugusta-Margaret River Clean Community Energy Group (AMRCCE) carried out the initial feasibility studies until Synergy took the reins of the project in 2023.\n\nAMRCCE chair Jessica Worrall said Synergy's plans had mitigated a lot of environmental impacts.\n\n\"They've looked at what clearing they're doing in that space and the potential impact on threatened environmental species and confirmed that they're doing less than 1 hectare of clearing,\" she said.\n\n\"They've done very thorough studies on bird and bat surveys and they've confirmed there's no black cockatoo nesting sites within that space.\"\n\nMs Worrall said attitudes towards the visual pollution caused by turbineswere subjective.\n\n\"Either you look at them and say, 'That's our contribution to being part of the solution for the climate crisis' or you look at them and see a change that you don't like,\" she said.\n\nAcidic soil concerns\n\nIn 1999, BHP prematurely closed its Beenup titanium mine in Scott River due to environmental issues regarding the exposure of acid sulphate soils.\n\nWhen disturbed or exposed to air, acid sulphate soils can release sulphuric acid and other heavy metals into surrounding water bodies and groundwater.\n\nSynergy's EPA submission included plans to neutralise the exposed acidic soil with lime treatment during construction to avoid contamination.\n\nThe management plan has not allayed the concerns of some nearby farmers.\n\nGary Buller's farming property borders the proposed site, and he said he had turned down hundreds of thousands of dollars to host the turbines.\n\nHe said he did so because the risks of exposing acidic soil through drilling were too great.\n\n\"We've declined to be involved because we see the threat to the environment,\" he said.\n\n\"If they rupture the aquifer underneath they're going to have acid sulphate soil mixing with a massive volume of water they won't be able to stop.\n\n\"All of that is going to make its way into the river and they won't be able to stop it.\"",

I felt like a lot of people more so wanted to sweep the matter under the rug and not actually address the problem,\" Ravi told ABC Sport.\n\n\"The league didn't really have a policy and process in place, the club didn't really know what to do, and therefore, no real action happened.\"\n\nRavi found her experience was all too familiar for culturally diverse women in community sport when she helped author a new study by Deakin University, supported by Monash University and the University of Melbourne, which revealed women and girls were being turned away from community sport due to the impact of racism.\n\nThe research involved in-depth interviews with 20 women from ethnically diverse backgrounds involved in community sport in Victoria as players, coaches, parents, administrators, board and committee members. They all had either experienced or witnessed first-hand racism in sport.\n\nRacism in community sport has consequences that go beyond the field Community sport is celebrated for its contributions to physical and mental health, to social connection and inclusion \u2014 yet persistent racism within sport at all levels undermines this ideal and has lasting effects on the community.\n\nIt found racist behaviour experienced by women and girls most commonly took the form of appearance-based name-calling, bias, microaggressions and a lack of understanding of diverse cultures.\n\nProject lead associate professor Kim Toffoletti said a Victorian rugby player of Pacific Islands descent told of being called an \"island monkey\" and a \"savage\".\n\n\"Another sportswoman of Muslim heritage was told that by playing sport, she had been freed from wearing a hijab. Both examples are insensitive at best, and discriminatory and offensive at worst,\" Toffoletti said.\n\nThe findings have prompted calls by researchers for a zero-tolerance approach to racism in community sporting clubs and a need for clearer guidelines on what constitutes racism, the consequences for such behaviour, and greater transparency in reporting.\n\nResearchers have called for clearer guidelines on what constitutes racism, the consequences for such behaviour and greater transparency in reporting. (Getty)\n\nRavi said they found a lot of participants hesitated in reporting racism in the first place, as they did not have any trust in the reporting process and confidence that anything would be done about it.\n\nShe added that many felt \"there wasn't really any consideration for the person's well-being\" when they reported issues, something she could relate to from her own experience.\n\n\"I was very exhausted, just mentally exhausted, I felt gaslit throughout the whole process,\" she said.\n\n\"I felt like I had to kind of justify that, OK, no, this is the right thing I am doing, I'm not wrong.\"\n\nMolina Asthana, founder of Multicultural Women In Sport, has served on a vast array of boards, including across Table Tennis Victoria, Handball Victoria and Gymnastics Victoria.\n\nTony Armstrong's new series Proud Gamilaroi man and TV presenter Tony Armstrong has felt the sting of racist trolling online. Now he's using it as ammunition as he tackles racism in sport in the new documentary series End Game.\n\nShe said a lack of culturally diverse people in executive positions, on boards and in administrative positions could often result in a lack of understanding around how racism permeated sport and could impact its participants.\n\n\"Because we are in such a white sort of Anglo environment, most of the time in the sporting sector, you don't get much support for your views. You're called a troublemaker, usually, if you have different views,\" Asthana said.\n\n\"So everyone will sort of side with the majority and the person who's in a minority, who's being discriminated against, who raises their voice against discrimination, [they] are constantly marginalised.\n\n\"Their viewpoint is just not understood, or they're made to feel like they're creating conflict, rather than actually raising an issue.\"\n\nUniversity of Melbourne researcher Professor Karen Farquharson added: \"Participants also believed existing organisational strategies in community sport to address racism, such as hosting multicultural days and Indigenous rounds, are tokenistic and not meaningful.\"\n\nRavi said she hoped the report would be read by clubs and leagues across all levels of community sport, who would then improve support systems for culturally diverse women and girls in sport who experience racism.\n\n\"[We wanted] to try to illustrate the impact of racism on people and our communities, so then we can try to educate people as to the meaning behind it, their actions and how it can really deeply scar and hurt people,\" Ravi said.",

(Supplied: Bureau of Meteorology)\n\nWhile the system stayed offshore on Tuesday, satellite imagery showed it spinning a spiral of cloud, showers and thunderstorms across parts of WA.\n\nBut as it started to move onshore in a south-easterly direction overnight, the weather situation amplified, triggering more showers and thunderstorms.\n\nWhat areas are at risk?\n\nWhile some places across WA's southern half got a taste of the action yesterday, the thunderstorm outlook for Wednesday covers a much broader area \u2014 almost two-thirds of the state.\n\nStorms are forecast for almost two thirds of the state. (ABC News)\n\nMeteorologist Jessica Lingard said the areas likely to see severe storms were further away from the coast, extending from around the eastern hills of Perth, up into the Central Wheatbelt, Great Southern, and into the Goldfields and parts of the South Interior district.\n\nWas Australia's winter actually colder than normal? The general sentiment that Australia just shivered through a cold winter is false \u2014although it wasn't as warm as forecasts predicted pre-season.\n\n\"The main risk across those areas is for heavy rainfall, but the Goldfields and the South Interior could also see some damaging wind gusts,\" she said.\n\n\"There are also parts of the Wheatbelt and Goldfields which could see large hailstones.\n\n\"This isn't a guarantee, but it is just a watch point because obviously this is very inconvenient timing for farmers trying to harvest their crops.\"\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology has issued a strong wind warning for the Ningaloo, Gascoyne, Geraldton, Perth, Bunbury Geographe, Leeuwin and Eucla coasts.\n\nHow much rainfall?\n\nIf you're keeping an eye on the rainfall radar, it may look like there's been a lot of rainfall.\n\nHowever, the rain gauges would make you second-guess that.\n\nMs Lingard said that was due to the bases of the thunderstorms sitting higher up in the sky, causing them to feel more humid.\n\n\"These are mid-level thunderstorms, and so as a result, most of that rainfall that is falling is evaporating into the atmosphere before it gets a chance to hit a rain gauge,\" she said.\n\nJessica Lingard says hail is possible for parts of the state. (ABC News: Tabarak Al Jrood)\n\nAs the trough and low-pressure cell move south-east on Wednesday, the mugginess will ease, allowing more rainfall to hit the ground.\n\nThe rain will be quite patchy depending on how and where those thunderstorms fall, but totals up to 50mm or more between Tuesday and Thursday night aren't out of the question for some areas south of Carnarvon.\n\nIn between those storms, rainfall totals will likely be in the single digits, while some spots may miss out completely.\n\nAreas south of Carnarvon could receive up to 50mm of rain. (ABC News)\n\nIn terms of Perth, the metro managed to stay fairly clear yesterday with only an odd rumble around and a couple of light drizzles.\n\nBut there is a higher chance the city could see more storm activity on Wednesday that could even result in it recording a higher rainfall total for this month in its first week than for the whole of November 2024.\n\nLast year, the metro gauge collected a total of 10.4mm of rainfall across November\n\n\"If a thunderstorm goes right over the rain gauge, then absolutely, we could see some low double-digit falls,\" Ms Lingard said.\n\n\"But obviously these are isolated thunderstorms and we really just need it to move over Mount Lawley [observation station] in order to get that rainfall onto the record books.\"\n\nWhat's next on the forecast?\n\nWe won't have to wait too long for conditions to clear as the low moves to the south-east and away from the country by Thursday.\n\nThe wet weather is expected to clear by the end of the week. (ABC News: James Carmody)\n\nIt will leave behind a trail of showers along the south-eastern coastline, but the rest of the state can expect to see more settled weather as our next ridge of high-pressure forms over the southern half.\n\nSo while West Australians can expect to enjoy sunny spring conditions this weekend, the stormy system is set to bring another round of wet weather to an already drenched east coast.",

        "text": "Nick Kyrgios, Australian former Wimbledon finalist, is to play women's world number one Aryna Sabalenka in an exhibition match in Dubai.\n\nThe clash evokes memories of the 1973 Battle of the Sexes match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs \u2014 which King won in straight sets in the Houston Astrodome and was later the subject of a Hollywood movie.\n\nKyrgios also follows Australians Margaret Court, Evonne Goolagong Cawley and Pat Cash in playing such a match.\n\nThe exhibition, to take place on December 28, was confirmed by both players on social media. It is likely to be played under modified rules, including Kyrgios being restricted to a single serve.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n\"When the world No.1 challenges you, you answer the call. I've got massive respect for Aryna; she's a powerhouse and a true champion,\" said Kyrgios, who shares an agent with Sabalenka.\n\n\" But I've never backed down from a challenge, and I'm not just here to play, I'm here to entertain. This is what I live for. \"\n\nKyrgios, 30, has barely played in recent years after being plagued by injuries and is ranked 652nd in the world.\n\nHe was in the top 20 in October 2022 when he was forced to withdraw from the quarter-final of the ATP 500 Tokyo Open with a left knee injury.\n\nHe has since played six matches, winning one, losing four and retiring in the other. He last played on the ATP Tour at the Miami Open in March.\n\n\"I have a lot of respect for Nick and his talent, but make no mistake, I'm ready to bring my A-game,\" Sabalenka, 27, has said of the match.\n\nAryna Sabalenka won her second straight US Open in 2025. (Getty Images: Elsa)\n\nThe Battle of the Sexes match came after Riggs, then 55 and a long-retired tennis pro, beat Court in May 1973.\n\nCourt, who won the Australian, French and US Open titles that year, lost 6-2, 6-1 in what was later dubbed the \"Mother's Day Massacre\".\n\nKing, who had initially rejected Riggs' challenge, then felt she had to respond, in what was promoted as the first official Battle of the Sexes.\n\nKing won 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 in front of an estimated 90 million TV viewers.\n\n\"I have so much respect for Billie Jean King and what she has done for the women's game,\" Sabalenka said.\n\n\"I'm proud to represent women's tennis and to be part of this modern take on the iconic Battle of the Sexes match.\"\n\nNick Kyrgios has barely played in the last three years due to injury. (Getty Images/Frey/TPN)\n\nThere have been plenty of other mixed-gender singles matches right back to 1888 when the Wimbledon men's and women's singles champions played each other.\n\nErnest Renshaw beat Lottie Dod 2-6, 7-5, 7-5 after Dod began every game 30-0 up.\n\nAmong them, in 1975, Goolagong Cawley, then known as Evonne Goolagong, beat Ilie Nastase 7-5. The latter, a noted entertainer, entered court in a dress, was not allowed to rush the net unless forced to by Goolagong's shot, and only had one serve while the Australian could hit into the doubles alleys.\n\nCash, then in his early fifties, lost to then-British number one Johanna Konta in 2017, 6-3. The match was played in a shopping centre, on an artificial surface, with former player Greg Rusedski umpiring and Cash described as \"flamboyant\" with his shot-making.\n\nAAP",

        "text": "Notably, while its earnings were generally well received by investors, Meta\u2019s share price has plunged since it revealed its expenditure plans. Its shares are down about 16.5 per cent over the past week, wiping about $US270 billion off its market capitalisation. Unlike the other mega techs that reported last week, Meta doesn\u2019t have a cloud business to sell capacity to others, which could offset \u2013 or at least share \u2013 some of the AI risk and generate revenue from third parties. Loading Its pathway towards monetising its AI investment through new revenue streams is more opaque than that of the other mega techs, and plays more directly into concerns about the returns on these massive investments. That question mark over the ability of those investing previously unthinkable amounts into AI to generate returns that validate the scale and risk of those investments is central to scepticism about the sustainability of the boom in AI stocks.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much scepticism over the potentially transformative impact of AI, but whether the companies are over-investing and whether their eventual returns will justify today\u2019s valuations. With the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d tech companies \u2013Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2013 accounting for almost 40 per cent of the entire value of the S&P 500, the fate of the market hangs on the question of how to assess the potential of AI revenues and profits for those companies against their profligate spending. There are wider implications. The scale of their investments is propping up the entire US economy at a time when Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, their chilling effect on US investment outside AI, a shrinking manufacturing sector, rising unemployment amid falling immigration and a government shutdown are depressing activity and economic growth.\n\nThe frothy valuations and intensifying interconnectedness of the AI companies is therefore creating a significant vulnerability for investors, the economy and the US financial system. That vulnerability will swell because, where AI investment was initially funded from the mega techs cash flows or, for companies like OpenAI, through equity investments, there is an increasing use of debt \u2013 both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet \u2013 to pay for expenditures that are generating relatively modest revenues. It isn\u2019t surprising that some see that vulnerability as an opportunity. Michael Burry, who made a killing by betting against the sub-prime mortgage market in the leadup to the 2008 financial crisis (and was made a celebrity by the Michael Lewis book and the subsequent film, \u201cThe Big Short\u201d) has reportedly taken out $US1.1 billion in short positions, via put options, against Nvidia and Palantir. Burry has posted references to \u201cbubbles\u201d on social media and highlighted discussions of the circular and incestuous financing relationships that are a feature of an AI sector whose voracious and perhaps unprecedented appetite for capital has forced collaboration by competitors and very creative financing.\n\nHe\u2019s not the only one thinking that AI stocks may have run too far, too fast. Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon and Morgan Stanley\u2019s Ted Pick, speaking at an investment conference in Hong Kong this week, both suggested there could be a significant sharemarket correction over the next year or two. Solomon said he thought it likely that there would be a 10 to 20 per cent \u201cdrawdown\u201d in the next 12 to 24 months, while Pick said his firm would welcome the possibility of a 10 to 15 per cent pullback that wasn\u2019t driven by \u201csome sort of macro cliff effect.\u201d Both were referring to the sort of routine corrections that can occur during a lengthy bull market run. Burry seems to be betting on something more structural and destructive.\n\nWhile most of the market\u2019s focus is on the validity of AI spending, another recent influence has been provided by the Federal Reserve Board. The Fed cut its policy rate by 25 basis points last week, as expected, but revealed unexpected divisions and uncertainty about the outlook for the rest of the year. Chairman Jerome Powell referred to \u201cdriving in the fog,\u201d which was as much a reference to the clouded outlook for unemployment and inflation as it was to the shutdown-driven absence of economic data. Loading Investors who had pencilled in another rate cut in December, which would be positive for the sharemarket and other risk assets, are now having doubts that the Fed will deliver. There\u2019s also Trump\u2019s tariffs, which are being challenged in the US Supreme Court this week. Revenue from those tariffs had provided some comfort that the growth in America\u2019s debt and deficits might be moderated, at least to a degree.",

Reading this year\u2019s shortlist felt like walking through a succession of dioramas showing the dislocation of people, the what-happens-next stories of the people who cross borders and fill our newspaper headlines. They are stories, from wherever they come, that speak to the here and now. So many characters know themselves to be outsiders. In Kiran Desai\u2019s The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny \u2013 currently the bookies\u2019 frontrunner to win \u2013 we meet middle-class Indians shredded by the competing demands of tradition and ambition, of their Indian loyalties and Western leanings, as they move between continents. Susan Choi\u2019s Flashlight revolves around Serk, an explosively furious Korean father of an American family whose mysterious disappearance throws a spotlight on how little anyone knows about him. He has never fitted in. Kiran Desai\u2019s sprawling novel The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny is hotly tipped to win this yeas Booker Prize. Credit: NYT The cultivated Asian-American actor in Katie Kitamura\u2019s Audition, by contrast, seems like a perfect fit with the rarefied atmosphere of upper-crust Manhattan. That is until the seal to her sedate world is broken, and she has to deal with intruders: people who resemble her and seem to think they can thus make a claim on her. In David Szalay\u2019s Flesh, a parvenu plutocrat from Hungary moves among the British super-rich saying almost nothing; whatever inner life he may have is not available to anyone. That includes us, the readers; the effect is deeply disquieting. Even Andrew Miller\u2019s The Land in Winter, which is set in 1962 and burrows into the marriages of two couples living in a snowbound English village, is about a sense of displacement. Here, however, the divisions are grounded in class. Eric, the country doctor with traces of the despised Brummy accent, feels his inferiority to gracious Irene, his wife; Rita, a former showgirl, is married to Bill, who has given up the advantages bestowed by his public school to farm a smallholding, trying to pass as a country yokel. There is no hope that Rita will pass as a farmer\u2019s wife. English novelist Andrew MIller\u2019s The Land in Winter is also a favourite to win. Credit: Getty Images Class is not the only divide, even here and even then; there are already foreigners, clinging to survival. Bill\u2019s father left central Europe to become a criminal in the East End, a stain his son\u2019s education and pure intentions cannot erase. Eric\u2019s colleague Gabby has an accent too; his shirtsleeves don\u2019t quite cover the numbers tattooed on his arm. Miller\u2019s genius is to show how this sense of unbelonging seeps through the lives of these mismatched couples and the displaced persons in their midst, just as the terrible cold of that legendary 1962 winter wafts into houses, beds or shoes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe last of the six contenders, Ben Markovits\u2019 The Rest of Our Lives, also revolves around an uncomfortable couple, although there are no intruders in their seamlessly American lives. Tom Layward is a legal academic in what he calls a \u201cC-minus marriage\u201d. After his wife had an affair 12 years earlier, he promised himself he could leave her after their younger child goes to college. The day has come. He drops Miriam off at her dorm, then heads west. What follows is a half-jocular, half-confessional account of his midlife crisis on the road. There are highway diners, a dive bar and some very bad food; meanwhile, he is increasingly aware he is ill. His tone with us, however, remains relentlessly breezy. California, here he comes. British-American author Ben Markovits Credit: Kat Green Istvan, the moving force in Canadian-born Szalay\u2019s Flesh, arrives in London 50 years after Bill\u2019s shady father and the doctor in The Land in Winter. He isn\u2019t running from anything; he has no great hope but to make a living. Fate, however, has plans for him. Landing a job as a personal security guard, he beds and then marries his employer\u2019s widow. It is her money \u2013 along with his acumen as a property developer \u2013 that makes him rich. Flesh is a kind of Dick Whittington fable, but it has none of the flourishes of fairytale. There are pages of conversation, but Istvan rarely says more than \u201cOK\u201d. Where there is description, it is aggressively slapdash, the kind of thing Istvan himself might write. The net effect is propulsive and surprisingly gripping. Two books reflect the diversity of the Asian-American diaspora. In Choi\u2019s Flashlight, Serk, the Korean engineer, is married to Anne; they have a daughter, Louisa. Serk has a nightmarish past, having lost most of his family in North Korea\u2019s ideological purges. He shares this with no one; instead, his compressed pain bubbles over in almost perpetual fury with everything except his beloved child. When he vanishes from a beach on holiday in Japan, he is assumed to have drowned; as the real story emerges, the novel switches gears to become a kind of reportage about the North Korean \u201cdisappeared\u201d. It is structurally clunky, but what Choi is telling us is so shocking that it scarcely matters. American novelist Susan Choi. Credit: Getty Images In Kitamura\u2019s highly polished Audition, an unnamed actress of unspecified Asian origins is married to Tomas, a writer, in two hinged stories that are both versions of the same life, one with and one without a child. In the first account, a mixed-race young man called Xavier announces himself as the actress\u2019s long-lost son; in the second story, he moves into her apartment with his girlfriend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCool and elusive, Audition presents Tomas and his wife as actors on the stage where any unannounced entry from the wings is a profound disruption. Both halves of the story vibrate with resentment, but both the actress and Kitamura\u2019s prose are too refined to spill into anger; our nameless heroine is as alienated from her own feelings as she is from her surroundings. Complex, provoking and acutely observed, Audition feels flawless \u2013 which is not to say it should win. Katie Kitamura\u2019s highly polished Audition is cool and elusive. Credit: NYT Many critical bets are on Desai\u2019s The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny. It\u2019s easy to see why. It\u2019s big, in an authentically Bollywood sense. It is stuffed with bracing zingers about the foibles of both Indians and Americans, details of food, birds, knick-knacks in Rajasthani castles, shopfronts in Jackson Heights, comedic servants, eccentric fathers and grasping mothers, bouncing through 700-odd pages as star-crossed Sonia and Sunny keep finding love and then losing it again. They are both aspiring writers who worry over presenting versions of India that serve up the culture in a way that will appeal to Westerners; Desai herself, in fact, does exactly this. What she also does, however \u2013 terrifically well \u2013 is convey the sense of falling in love, of attraction and seduction and the sensual fulfilment of intimacy, without a hint of cheesiness or excess. Also central to the story is her understanding of a masala identity: how ricocheting between cultures bestows complexity as well as confusion. It is a bravura work. Loading Desai has already won once, with her equally hefty The Inheritance of Loss, in 2006. Will she win again? Rumour has it that hers is the chairman\u2019s favourite, but the great question next week will almost certainly be which book Carrie Bradshaw picked. There is, in fact, no clear front-runner here. Despite a certain perverse fondness for the frosty brilliance of Audition, I would plump for Miller\u2019s The Land in Winter. Others on the longlist outstripped it for inventive exuberance: I\u2019m thinking of Maria Reva\u2019s Endling, a wild ride through snail studies, the Ukraine War and bride markets that left me breathless.\n\nAdvertisement",

Eleven years, it was a great life and my family got to live a great life. There were negatives with it, but there were plenty of positives with it. I wouldn\u2019t change any of it at all. Probably there\u2019s some lessons there that I maybe knew or some things that I knew I needed to change or got wrong. But sometimes you don\u2019t make those until you get sacked or terminated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve looked at it from a perspective of \u2018it is what it is, I\u2019ve had a good life and enjoyed it, but what can I learn from it\u2019? So if I got any opportunities again moving forward, is there anything that I could do differently? But I feel a lot of that just comes with time and experience. You don\u2019t learn from anything unless you make mistakes. It\u2019s just making sure you don\u2019t make them over and over.\u201d\n\nArthur has had an immediate impact since joining the Rhinos last year. When he took over, the team was languishing in ninth position. He led them to third this year and were only eliminated after a miracle last second try to St Helens in the finals series.\n\nHe applied for the Perth Bears job but missed out in favour of Mal Meninga. He\u2019s since signed an extension with the Rhinos but feels he has a point to prove in the NRL after falling agonisingly short with the Eels against the Panthers in the \u201922 decider.",

We are at the early stages but we've done some reports with CSIRO, the Harry Butler Institute, the Harry Perkins institute and the future looks good, but we've got to do more research, and that's where the Western science and traditional knowledge comes together.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Professor Wear's leadership, Tidal Moon is partnering with scientists on a world-first project to restore sea grass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We wanted to bring a cultural-directed solution to the world to show how we can restore our sea meadows in Shark Bay and hopefully we're doing a good job so far because we've just been granted a thirteen-year translocation permit, and it's been hard work but I said last night when merit brings opportunity, good things can happen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIndigenous divers are playing a leading role in environmental observation and sea grass restoration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sea Grass is very important to Shark Bay, it also filters all the nutrients through, it stops currents, it stores carbon, there's ancient carbon beneath the sea meadows as well, so it plays a very vital role for both climate biodiversity and traditional knowledge of custodians.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Consumer advocacy group Choice has unveiled its 20th annual Shonky Awards list of products, services and companies it deems dishonest or unreliable.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those in the 'winners' circle, the Commonwealth Bank earned the dubious honour for the fourth time, making it \"the most awarded Australian company in Shonkys history\", according to Choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank was included this year for \"refusing to refund millions of low-income customers $270 million in fees that never should've been charged\", Choice CEO Ashley de Silva said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July this year, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission released a review finding that several banks had charged excessive fees to low-income Australians .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In CommBank's case, 2.2 million customers were collectively charged $270 million in unfair fees,\" de Silva said.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Banks to refund excessive account fees for low income customers SBS News 03:21 English\n\nAt the time, the Commonwealth Bank said it would not refund the $270 million, arguing that fees had been disclosed to customers and charged in accordance with terms and conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS News responding to the Shonkys listing, a Commonwealth spokesperson said the bank had committed to \"making goodwill adjustments where appropriate to customers who have incurred unusually high fees\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For eligible concession customers, we have paused certain fees, including overdraw and monthly account-keeping fees,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank made $25 million in goodwill payments to approximately 87,000 First Nations concession customer accounts following a 2024 ASIC report, they said.\n\n\n\nAn 'unsafe haven'\n\nOther recipients this year included the online shopping platform Temu, with Choice citing poor customer service, difficulty securing refunds, and being \"an unsafe haven for dodgy sales tactics and fast fashion\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut de Silva said safety was \"perhaps the biggest issue\" at Temu.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, Choice randomly tested 15 products from Temu, all of which failed at least one requirement of Australian regulations designed to keep children safe.\n\n\n\nWhile Temu is popular for its wide range of products and low prices, it's been criticised for poor customer service, among other issues. Source: Getty / Bloomberg / Raul Ariano All 15 products were removed from sale. But Temu has \"continued to make headlines for safety issues\", de Silva said, referencing an incident last year where a Queensland child suffered burns after a hoodie purchased from Temu she was wearing went up in flames when \"rogue sparks\" from a firepit landed on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ACCC found the hoodie wasn't compliant with mandatory safety standards, as it had no fire warning label of any sort. Four months later, Temu recalled the hoodie, but the damage had already been done.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS News, Temu said consumer safety was a \"top priority\" for the company, and while it did not manufacture products, it took \"platform responsibility seriously\" and acted swiftly to remove listings when there were safety concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the platform said items were \"promptly removed\" after safety issues were raised by Choice, and it had further strengthened oversight.\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson said the company had invested significantly in measures such as vetting sellers, pre-listing checks and monitoring by both automated systems and human review.\n\n\n\nEnergy retailers' 'sneaky' tactics\n\nEnergy retailers were also in Choice's sights this year, receiving a Shonky Award for \"sneaky pricing tactics designed to confuse customers\".\n\n\n\n\n\nDe Silva said the group had seen a number of retailers roll out new, cheaper plans with the exact same name as existing plans \u2014 leading many consumers to believe they were already on the best plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"CHOICE research estimated energy customers could have collectively saved about $65 million per year if retailers had made it clear that the new plan with the same name was cheaper than the existing one,\" de Silva said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Energy Council, the peak body for energy retailers, said retailers' marketing practices and how they described their offers were heavily regulated by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) and monitored by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).\n\n\n\n\"Retailers are required to maintain compliance with these regulations, which have been recently amended to make it easier for customers to compare offers,\" a spokesperson told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Better Bills guidelines, overseen by the AER, determine what wording retailers must use on bills when notifying customers of the best offer available,\" they said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ACCC had been aware of this issue for some time, and retailers had been in lengthy discussions with the AER on changing the wording on bills to ensure it was easier for customers to understand.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AER subsequently allowed changes to the 'better offer' message earlier this year, so when a better offer that has the same name as a current plan is used, a statement will also appear on the bill to clarify and explain it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson said the energy council had not seen any modelling to support Choice's $65 million figure or an explanation of how the group arrived at it.\n\n\n\nIt's the 20th year Choice has run its Shonky Awards. Source: Supplied Private health insurer HCF also received a Shonky Award this year for what Choice described as a \"price rise in disguise\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group said HCF had closed its Premium Gold policy to new members and instead released a \"nearly identical\" policy called Optimal Gold with a 34.6 per cent price increase.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt argued HCF had done this to bypass the government approval process for health insurance premium increases on existing policies.\n\n\n\nIn a statement to SBS News, HCF said: \"To help keep Gold-level protection accessible, equitable, and sustainable, HCF updated its product and pricing structure for new Gold policy sales in February 2025.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These changes apply only to new sales and are in full compliance with industry standards and regulations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe insurer added that challenges with the sustainability of Gold-level coverage reflected broader pressures within the sectors, driven by \"higher costs from complex claims, particularly in mental health\".\n\n\n\nA plug-in heater that 'doesn't plug in'\n\nWhile most of Choice's scorn this year was for companies and services, it did highlight one individual product: a mini electric heater called the Handy Heater Turbo 800.\n\n\n\n\n\nDe Silva said it was a \"plug-in heater that doesn't plug in\", as it wouldn't fit directly into an Australian power point without an adaptor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The travel adaptor that came with the heater also wasn't compliant, leaving pins exposed when plugged into an Australian power point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Other safety issues included a lack of any kind of thermal protection device, insecure wiring, and a heating element directly mounted onto thermoplastic \u2014 a material that becomes soft when heated.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChoice's testing also revealed the heater didn't produce \"anywhere near as much heat as its advertising suggests\", de Silva said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News sought comment from the distributor of the Handy Heater Turbo 800 but did not hear back before publication.\n\n\n\n",

That means we have lots of electricity in the middle of the day and often, electricity prices are negative in the middle of the day, energy companies are not paying for the power they'd provide in the middle of the day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen announcing the new Solar Sharer program in three eastern states.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scheme will require energy companies to offer at least three hours of free solar power to households during the middle of the day, when solar power generation is at its highest.\n\n\n\n\n\nChris Bowen says even consumers without solar panels, those in apartments, and those who rent, can benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is a meaningful step forward, a material improvement, a chance to improve the opportunities for people to reduce their bills and put them in charge - put them in charge of their own energy use so they can manage their energy use to maximise their best interests, not the best interests of the energy companies.\" The scheme will be offered to consumers in New South Wales, South Australia and southeast Queensland from mid-2026, with negotiations underway to broaden it to other states in 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomers who choose to take up the deal must have a smart meter, and will benefit by shifting their use of appliances, such as dishwashers and washing machines, to the middle of the day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's led Nationals Senator Matt Canavan to warn that consumers will end up paying for energy at other times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're not getting free power. We're getting more expensive power. Because you're only going to get this deal if you take on a smart meter and these smart meters, they can let you have cheaper power one part of the day, but the other parts of the day, when you want to use your air conditioning when you get home from work and have to turn the lights on, you're going to be paying much much more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrancis Vierboom, the CEO of not-for-profit Rewiring Australia, says that's not true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's lots of ways that you might be able to benefit from this discount. It might be if you've got a pool pump you can run. It might be if you've got a car that you charge up, it might be that on hot days you can benefit from running your air conditioner really hard for three hours to cool your home down.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis from the energy department shows a single-person household could save nine per cent on bills, by moving just 10 per cent of energy use to the free energy window.\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, Francis Vierboom says, the system will have a flow-on effect to the entire energy market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It does actually make the whole system cheaper if we move lots of this demand into the middle (of the day). It means we need to pay less for all the power stations that run. We don't have to burn coal, we don't have to build extra power stations. So the generation of the energy is cheaper, but also importantly, it spreads the demand out better on the grid and it means that the peaks in the evening are lower if people have used more of the energy earlier on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nClare Savage is Chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, which works to protect consumer interests.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also says the changes could help address peak demand on Australia's energy network.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Australian Energy Council, which represents retailers, says they are disappointed the government didn't consult them on the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government hopes the move - which aims to reduce reliance on coal-generated energy - will help it reach its target of 82 per cent renewable electricity by 2030, and its aim to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\n\n\n",

Those three interest rate cuts are providing a little bit of relief, but we know that many Australians would have preferred to see more relief delivered today. We've got inflation down, we've kept unemployment low, the economy continues to grow, the private sector is recovering in welcoming ways, we got real wages growing, and interest rate's fallen three time this year, but we always know that there's more work to do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interest rate was a key focus in Question Time, with the Coalition criticising Labor for failing to drive down the rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition leader Sussan Ley accuses Labor of reckless spending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Prime Minister, Australians have just been denied a Christmas rate cut, because of Labor's reckless spending. 32 per cent of households are going without food or skipping meals, and in some suburbs, 90 per cent are struggling to pay their mortgage, Labor has just killed a Christmas rate cut. Is this what the Prime Minister meant when he promised life would be cheaper under him?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says Ms Ley's question contain what he calls rhetorical flourishes before detailing his government's cost of living relief.\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Change Minister Chris Bowen says Labor's new policy offering three hours of free electricity to solar-ready households will maximise savings for Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three hours of free electricity will be part of Labor's Solar Share program announced today.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will be first implemented in New South Wales, south-east Queensland and South Australia from July next year in homes with smart meters, regardless whether they have installed rooftop solar panels or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Bowen says Australian households can use these three hours of peak solar production time to conduct dishwashing or charge their electric vehicles to save money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are a solar nation, we've 4.2 million houses with solar panels on their roofs. That means we have lots of electricity in the middle of the day and often, electricity prices are negative in the middle of the day, energy companies are not paying for the power they'd provide in the middle of the day. So we will require part of the default market offer in those states where it applies, energy companies to make that part of their offer under DMO.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPolice have charged 18 people and seized a combined 269 kilograms of illicit drugs estimated to be worth $60 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales Police, Western Australia Police and Australia Federal Police have launched a joint investigation into a national drug syndicate over large-scale supply of illicit drugs across Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween May and October 2025, police detectives executed 30 search warrants across New South Wales and Western Australia, and 18 people have been arrested.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales Police Detective Superintendent John Watson says while the focus of this operation is on New South Wales and Western Australia, the investigation has found the syndicate has connections in every state and territory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They had the means and their disposal, regardless of the type of drug to receive it, to break it open, and to move it. They were well organised, they were very capable in doing it in very short time frame, and as I said previously, moving multiple consignments. So this was a real breakthrough for law enforcement, being able to work at both ends of Australia, from coast to coast.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChina has extended its free-visa policy to next year, meaning Australians can continue to travel to China for 30 days without applying for a visa in advance.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina launched the visa-free policy last year to 31 countries - including Australia - last year in an attempt to boost the country's tourism amid economic slowdown.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts Foreign Ministry has announced it will extend the scheme for one more year, while also including Sweden in the visa waiver program.\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf Yours has won the Melbourne Cup for 2025 in cold and drizzly conditions at Flemington.\n\n\n\n\n\nJamie Melham steered Half Yours to victory to complete a historic double win.\n\n\n\n\n\nWeeks ago Melham became the first female jockey to win the Caulfield Cup.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Michele Bullock says \"temporary factors\" partially drove up recent higher-than-expected quarterly inflation figures, but there may be more inflationary pressure than the central bank initially believed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RBA left the cash rate target on hold at 3.6 per cent for the second time in a row at its board meeting on Tuesday, repeating a decision it made at its previous meeting in September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With private demand recovering and labour market conditions still appearing a little tight, the board decided that it was appropriate to maintain the cash rate at its current level at this meeting,\" the board said in its statement alongside the announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Financial conditions have eased since the beginning of the year, but it will take some time to see the full effects of earlier cash rate reductions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Given this, and the recent evidence of more persistent inflation, the board judged that it was appropriate to remain cautious, updating its view of the outlook as the data evolve.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said in a statement on Tuesday that while \"millions of Australians would've wanted to see more rate relief\", the decision was widely expected following the surprise surge in last week's inflation figures.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News In its recent data for the September quarter, the Australian Bureau of Statistics measured the consumer price index at 3.2 per cent, above the Reserve Bank's inflation target band of 2 to 3 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderlying, or trimmed mean inflation, the RBA's preferred measure of price movements, rose 1 per cent over the September quarter \u2014 higher than the Reserve Bank's forecast.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual trimmed mean inflation rose to 3 per cent, up from 2.7 per cent in the June quarter, marking the first time annual trimmed mean inflation had risen since December 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nBullock, speaking to reporters on Tuesday afternoon, said the RBA board believed some of that increase was \"driven by temporary factors such as travel costs, council rates and fuel, and we don\u2019t expect some of these to continue\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are, however, taking signals from stronger price increases that may suggest more inflationary pressure in the economy than we thought before,\" she added, citing the cost of new dwellings and market services both increasing by more than expected.\n\n\n\nBullock said the board had not considered a cut this time around. Asked about future cuts or increases, Bullock said \"anything's possible\" but that she believed \"we're at the right spot we need to be at the moment\" to respond to risks.\n\n\n\n\n\nBullock said the central bank was not \"wedded religiously to a particular path\" on rate decisions, and that it was trying to \"actively analyse the data as it comes through\".\n\n\n\nReserve Bank revises inflation forecast\n\nAlongside the announcement, the RBA updated its inflation forecast. It now expects underlying inflation to remain at 3.2 per cent until at least the middle of 2026, before easing back to 2.7 per cent by the year's end.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's up from the RBA's most recent predictions in August that the trimmed mean would ease to 2.6 per cent by the end of this year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We expect inflation to be above 3 per cent for much of next year before declining to around the middle of our target range by late 2027,\" it said in Tuesday's forecast.\n\n\n\nThe Reserve Bank has cut the cash rate three times this year. Source: AAP / Darren England Bullock said: \"We know forecasts are uncertain and the further out you go, the more uncertain they are.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RBA has cut the cash rate three times this year, each time by 0.25 percentage points. The first came in February, when it cut the rate from a 13-year high of 4.35 per cent to 4.10 per cent, and marked the first rate cut in five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rate was lowered to 3.85 per cent in May, and then again in August to 3.6 per cent, where it has sat since late September.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RBA board will meet for the final time this year in December.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Notably, while its earnings were generally well received by investors, Meta\u2019s share price has plunged since it revealed its expenditure plans. Its shares are down about 16.5 per cent over the past week, wiping about $US270 billion off its market capitalisation. Unlike the other mega techs that reported last week, Meta doesn\u2019t have a cloud business to sell capacity to others, which could offset \u2013 or at least share \u2013 some of the AI risk and generate revenue from third parties. Loading Its pathway towards monetising its AI investment through new revenue streams is more opaque than that of the other mega techs, and plays more directly into concerns about the returns on these massive investments. That question mark over the ability of those investing previously unthinkable amounts into AI to generate returns that validate the scale and risk of those investments is central to scepticism about the sustainability of the boom in AI stocks.\n\nIt\u2019s not so much scepticism over the potentially transformative impact of AI, but whether the companies are over-investing and whether their eventual returns will justify today\u2019s valuations. With the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d tech companies \u2013Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2013 accounting for almost 40 per cent of the entire value of the S&P 500, the fate of the market hangs on the question of how to assess the potential of AI revenues and profits for those companies against their profligate spending. There are wider implications. The scale of their investments is propping up the entire US economy at a time when Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, their chilling effect on US investment outside AI, a shrinking manufacturing sector, rising unemployment amid falling immigration and a government shutdown are depressing activity and economic growth.\n\nThe frothy valuations and intensifying interconnectedness of the AI companies is therefore creating a significant vulnerability for investors, the economy and the US financial system. That vulnerability will swell because, where AI investment was initially funded from the mega techs cash flows or, for companies like OpenAI, through equity investments, there is an increasing use of debt \u2013 both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet \u2013 to pay for expenditures that are generating relatively modest revenues. It isn\u2019t surprising that some see that vulnerability as an opportunity. Michael Burry, who made a killing by betting against the sub-prime mortgage market in the leadup to the 2008 financial crisis (and was made a celebrity by the Michael Lewis book and the subsequent film, \u201cThe Big Short\u201d) has reportedly taken out $US1.1 billion in short positions, via put options, against Nvidia and Palantir. Burry has posted references to \u201cbubbles\u201d on social media and highlighted discussions of the circular and incestuous financing relationships that are a feature of an AI sector whose voracious and perhaps unprecedented appetite for capital has forced collaboration by competitors and very creative financing.\n\nHe\u2019s not the only one thinking that AI stocks may have run too far, too fast. Goldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon and Morgan Stanley\u2019s Ted Pick, speaking at an investment conference in Hong Kong this week, both suggested there could be a significant sharemarket correction over the next year or two. Solomon said he thought it likely that there would be a 10 to 20 per cent \u201cdrawdown\u201d in the next 12 to 24 months, while Pick said his firm would welcome the possibility of a 10 to 15 per cent pullback that wasn\u2019t driven by \u201csome sort of macro cliff effect.\u201d Both were referring to the sort of routine corrections that can occur during a lengthy bull market run. Burry seems to be betting on something more structural and destructive.\n\nWhile most of the market\u2019s focus is on the validity of AI spending, another recent influence has been provided by the Federal Reserve Board. The Fed cut its policy rate by 25 basis points last week, as expected, but revealed unexpected divisions and uncertainty about the outlook for the rest of the year. Chairman Jerome Powell referred to \u201cdriving in the fog,\u201d which was as much a reference to the clouded outlook for unemployment and inflation as it was to the shutdown-driven absence of economic data. Loading Investors who had pencilled in another rate cut in December, which would be positive for the sharemarket and other risk assets, are now having doubts that the Fed will deliver. There\u2019s also Trump\u2019s tariffs, which are being challenged in the US Supreme Court this week. Revenue from those tariffs had provided some comfort that the growth in America\u2019s debt and deficits might be moderated, at least to a degree.",

In All\u2019s Fair, a legal drama that is at best awkward and at worst atrocious, Kim Kardashian gets top billing as Allura Grant, the queen of Los Angeles divorce attorneys. While she\u2019s a walking billboard for costume designer Paula Bradley, Kardashian\u2019s performance is monotonal and emotionally negligent. Imagine a void, daubed with designer product placement and nihilistic girlboss mantras.\n\nKim Kardashian and Naomi Watts star in new Ryan Murphy drama All\u2019s Fair.\n\nStill, it\u2019s always slay time in the first three episodes of All\u2019s Fair. A cold open flashed back 10 years, with Allura, fellow divorce lawyer Liberty Ronson (Naomi Watts) and investigator Emerald Greene (Niecy Nash-Betts) fleeing a boys\u2019 club firm to set up their own shop, solely representing women. Now, as a new client declares with reverence: \u201cYou\u2019re the best divorce lawyers in town, maybe the whole country.\u201d There are old shovels less blunt than the exposition dialogue thrown around here.\n\nThe show is slight yet somehow deeply questionable. It ticks off its aims with clunky sequences and then ignores the ramifications. Created by Ryan Murphy (American Horror Story), Jon Robin Baitz (Feud: Capote vs. the Swans), and Joe Baken (Doctor Odyssey), All\u2019s Fair is unreservedly ambitious and ready to go big, which takes it to the edge of parody and self-incrimination.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Given the sweep of the annual Booker Prize, the premier prize for literature written in English, it is constantly surprising how much books written many thousands of kilometres from each other pick up on similar themes. Reading this year\u2019s shortlist felt like walking through a succession of dioramas showing the dislocation of people, the what-happens-next stories of the people who cross borders and fill our newspaper headlines. They are stories, from wherever they come, that speak to the here and now. So many characters know themselves to be outsiders. In Kiran Desai\u2019s The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny \u2013 currently the bookies\u2019 frontrunner to win \u2013 we meet middle-class Indians shredded by the competing demands of tradition and ambition, of their Indian loyalties and Western leanings, as they move between continents. Susan Choi\u2019s Flashlight revolves around Serk, an explosively furious Korean father of an American family whose mysterious disappearance throws a spotlight on how little anyone knows about him. He has never fitted in. Kiran Desai\u2019s sprawling novel The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny is hotly tipped to win this yeas Booker Prize. Credit: NYT The cultivated Asian-American actor in Katie Kitamura\u2019s Audition, by contrast, seems like a perfect fit with the rarefied atmosphere of upper-crust Manhattan. That is until the seal to her sedate world is broken, and she has to deal with intruders: people who resemble her and seem to think they can thus make a claim on her. In David Szalay\u2019s Flesh, a parvenu plutocrat from Hungary moves among the British super-rich saying almost nothing; whatever inner life he may have is not available to anyone. That includes us, the readers; the effect is deeply disquieting. Even Andrew Miller\u2019s The Land in Winter, which is set in 1962 and burrows into the marriages of two couples living in a snowbound English village, is about a sense of displacement. Here, however, the divisions are grounded in class. Eric, the country doctor with traces of the despised Brummy accent, feels his inferiority to gracious Irene, his wife; Rita, a former showgirl, is married to Bill, who has given up the advantages bestowed by his public school to farm a smallholding, trying to pass as a country yokel. There is no hope that Rita will pass as a farmer\u2019s wife. English novelist Andrew MIller\u2019s The Land in Winter is also a favourite to win. Credit: Getty Images Class is not the only divide, even here and even then; there are already foreigners, clinging to survival. Bill\u2019s father left central Europe to become a criminal in the East End, a stain his son\u2019s education and pure intentions cannot erase. Eric\u2019s colleague Gabby has an accent too; his shirtsleeves don\u2019t quite cover the numbers tattooed on his arm. Miller\u2019s genius is to show how this sense of unbelonging seeps through the lives of these mismatched couples and the displaced persons in their midst, just as the terrible cold of that legendary 1962 winter wafts into houses, beds or shoes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe last of the six contenders, Ben Markovits\u2019 The Rest of Our Lives, also revolves around an uncomfortable couple, although there are no intruders in their seamlessly American lives. Tom Layward is a legal academic in what he calls a \u201cC-minus marriage\u201d. After his wife had an affair 12 years earlier, he promised himself he could leave her after their younger child goes to college. The day has come. He drops Miriam off at her dorm, then heads west. What follows is a half-jocular, half-confessional account of his midlife crisis on the road. There are highway diners, a dive bar and some very bad food; meanwhile, he is increasingly aware he is ill. His tone with us, however, remains relentlessly breezy. California, here he comes. British-American author Ben Markovits Credit: Kat Green Istvan, the moving force in Canadian-born Szalay\u2019s Flesh, arrives in London 50 years after Bill\u2019s shady father and the doctor in The Land in Winter. He isn\u2019t running from anything; he has no great hope but to make a living. Fate, however, has plans for him. Landing a job as a personal security guard, he beds and then marries his employer\u2019s widow. It is her money \u2013 along with his acumen as a property developer \u2013 that makes him rich. Flesh is a kind of Dick Whittington fable, but it has none of the flourishes of fairytale. There are pages of conversation, but Istvan rarely says more than \u201cOK\u201d. Where there is description, it is aggressively slapdash, the kind of thing Istvan himself might write. The net effect is propulsive and surprisingly gripping. Two books reflect the diversity of the Asian-American diaspora. In Choi\u2019s Flashlight, Serk, the Korean engineer, is married to Anne; they have a daughter, Louisa. Serk has a nightmarish past, having lost most of his family in North Korea\u2019s ideological purges. He shares this with no one; instead, his compressed pain bubbles over in almost perpetual fury with everything except his beloved child. When he vanishes from a beach on holiday in Japan, he is assumed to have drowned; as the real story emerges, the novel switches gears to become a kind of reportage about the North Korean \u201cdisappeared\u201d. It is structurally clunky, but what Choi is telling us is so shocking that it scarcely matters. American novelist Susan Choi. Credit: Getty Images In Kitamura\u2019s highly polished Audition, an unnamed actress of unspecified Asian origins is married to Tomas, a writer, in two hinged stories that are both versions of the same life, one with and one without a child. In the first account, a mixed-race young man called Xavier announces himself as the actress\u2019s long-lost son; in the second story, he moves into her apartment with his girlfriend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCool and elusive, Audition presents Tomas and his wife as actors on the stage where any unannounced entry from the wings is a profound disruption. Both halves of the story vibrate with resentment, but both the actress and Kitamura\u2019s prose are too refined to spill into anger; our nameless heroine is as alienated from her own feelings as she is from her surroundings. Complex, provoking and acutely observed, Audition feels flawless \u2013 which is not to say it should win. Katie Kitamura\u2019s highly polished Audition is cool and elusive. Credit: NYT Many critical bets are on Desai\u2019s The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny. It\u2019s easy to see why. It\u2019s big, in an authentically Bollywood sense. It is stuffed with bracing zingers about the foibles of both Indians and Americans, details of food, birds, knick-knacks in Rajasthani castles, shopfronts in Jackson Heights, comedic servants, eccentric fathers and grasping mothers, bouncing through 700-odd pages as star-crossed Sonia and Sunny keep finding love and then losing it again. They are both aspiring writers who worry over presenting versions of India that serve up the culture in a way that will appeal to Westerners; Desai herself, in fact, does exactly this. What she also does, however \u2013 terrifically well \u2013 is convey the sense of falling in love, of attraction and seduction and the sensual fulfilment of intimacy, without a hint of cheesiness or excess. Also central to the story is her understanding of a masala identity: how ricocheting between cultures bestows complexity as well as confusion. It is a bravura work. Loading Desai has already won once, with her equally hefty The Inheritance of Loss, in 2006. Will she win again? Rumour has it that hers is the chairman\u2019s favourite, but the great question next week will almost certainly be which book Carrie Bradshaw picked. There is, in fact, no clear front-runner here. Despite a certain perverse fondness for the frosty brilliance of Audition, I would plump for Miller\u2019s The Land in Winter. Others on the longlist outstripped it for inventive exuberance: I\u2019m thinking of Maria Reva\u2019s Endling, a wild ride through snail studies, the Ukraine War and bride markets that left me breathless.\n\nAdvertisement",

Eleven years, it was a great life and my family got to live a great life. There were negatives with it, but there were plenty of positives with it. I wouldn\u2019t change any of it at all. Probably there\u2019s some lessons there that I maybe knew or some things that I knew I needed to change or got wrong. But sometimes you don\u2019t make those until you get sacked or terminated.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve looked at it from a perspective of \u2018it is what it is, I\u2019ve had a good life and enjoyed it, but what can I learn from it\u2019? So if I got any opportunities again moving forward, is there anything that I could do differently? But I feel a lot of that just comes with time and experience. You don\u2019t learn from anything unless you make mistakes. It\u2019s just making sure you don\u2019t make them over and over.\u201d\n\nArthur has had an immediate impact since joining the Rhinos last year. When he took over, the team was languishing in ninth position. He led them to third this year and were only eliminated after a miracle last second try to St Helens in the finals series.\n\nHe applied for the Perth Bears job but missed out in favour of Mal Meninga.

(Stuart Walmsley/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nMr Jackson was born and raised in Broken Hill, in far western NSW, where he worked in the mines, at the power station, as a carpet layer and as a motel manager.\n\nProf Nguyen was concerned Mr Jackson's long and significant smoking history, and exposure to asbestos and mining dust, put him in a high-risk category for lung cancer.\n\nIn July 2018, Mr Jackson underwent a CT-guided lung biopsy and the specimen was sent to the RAH's pathology laboratory, where it was tested and analysed by SA Pathology.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"In essence, it is accepted that what occurred is that Mr Jackson's specimen did not reveal any evidence of malignancy,\" Mr White said.\n\n\"However, as accepted by SA Pathology, a minute piece of tissue from the sample of another biopsy taken from another patient contaminated Mr Jackson's sample. That patient's biopsy revealed carcinoma.\n\n\"The consequences of this error continued well beyond this date and ultimately are linked with his death.\"\n\nA coroner has recommended an independent review of SA Pathology's laboratories.

His respiratory failure worsened and he died on January 21, 2019.\n\nMr White recommended the health minister order an independent review of SA Pathology's laboratories, with the aim of improving procedures and practices to reduce the risk of cross-contamination.",

However it's the first thing everyone will miss in a crisis.\"\n\nThe lack of transparency in the growing private credit and equity markets has been a concern. (Joel Carrett/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nA \"Minsky moment\" refers to a sudden collapse in asset values after a long period of prosperity lulls investors into underestimating financial risks.\n\nPrivate credit funds are estimated to have grown by more than 500 per cent in the past decade.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nASIC says there are positives to the growth of private markets, such as increasing the availability of \"patient\", long-term capital.\n\nBut while some participants demonstrated strong practices, ASIC also witnessed many examples of poor practices that risked eroding confidence in the sector and hindered its development.\n\n\"We need to see a significant uplift in practices and if the sector can't get this right, law reform may be required - introducing new, mandatory obligations to lift standards and address poor consumer outcomes,\" Mr Longo said.\n\nJoe Longo says private companies are making the most of \"regulatory arbitrage\".
