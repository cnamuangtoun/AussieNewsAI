(Nine/Supplied)\n\nBut it was a side project he quietly worked on late at night which eventually allowed him to create a sense of freedom for his family and build a business with a billion-dollar success story.\n\nLee decided to learn coding, business and marketing entirely through free videos found on YouTube, often with a coffee in one hand and a toddler crawling in the other.\n\nArmed with his smartphone and curiosity, the video-sharing platform became his university.\n\nAs he gained experience in his trade, he went on to open his own tiling business, which taught him firsthand the struggles small business owners face daily.\n\nHis new side hustle helped him figure out how to eliminate common problems teams face.\n\nAt the age of 32, he decided to call time on his tiling career.\n\n\"I didn't want to do it for the next 30 years so I decided to quit,\" he said.\n\nLee set up his business Bookipi\ufeff in 2018 to offer businesses a simplified bookkeeping platform to save time.\n\nWhile he had high hopes for the business, it initially didn\ufeff't make money for the first few years and he was supported by his wife on his journey.\n\nBut he soon secured his first investment in 2020 and achieved growth.\n\nTim Lee would teach himself coding, marketing and business after long days at work.

        "text": "What would you do if you came out of a cinema and found you had somehow gone back in time to the 1980s?\n\nThat's the predicament facing Shannon, the teenage protagonist of Tegan Bennett Daylight's new young adult (YA) novel, How to Survive 1985.\n\nThe book follows Shannon as she tries to find her friends \u2014 who have also travelled back in time \u2014 and a way to return to her usual life.\n\nWhile it would be easy for a time travel tale to embrace the cliches of the era and have its characters get around in acid wash jeans while listening to power ballads on their walkmans, Daylight's book has fun with its setting \u2014 but takes a different path.\n\nLooking back to see how far we've come\n\nHow to Survive 1985 uses its time shift for social commentary, as Shannon reflects on how society has changed in the past four decades.\n\nSeeing a less inclusive Australia leads her to celebrate progress on gender equality, LGBTQIA+ rights and environmental issues.\n\nShe also becomes thankful for the modern medical advances that help people live longer, happier lives.\n\nDaylight is also the author of Stella Prize-shortlisted book, Six Bedrooms. (Supplied)\n\nDaylight says she has seen teenagers become more compassionate and inclusive, and wanted to celebrate this change.\n\n\"I come across Gen-Xers who seem to think that all the radical work stopped with us, as though we'd done everything that we needed to do, or that Gen Z are a hopeless bunch. I just don't believe that at all.\n\n\"I've been teaching for 30 years, and I've got kids, and I have found that young people are lost in some ways, but they just get kinder and kinder.\"\n\nTeenage-hood 'burned into your brain'\n\nWhile Daylight, who turned 16 in 1985, consulted with some Gen X friends about their memories of the 1980s, she didn't have to do too much research to set the scene.\n\n\"That part of your life gets burned into your brain,\" she explains of being a teenager.\n\n\"Anything that happens then stays [with you], so it was very, very easy to remember my attitudes, clothing, the music I was listening to and what the world looked like.\"\n\nDaylight drew on the rich memories 'etched into the brain' from her own experience of living through the 80s. (Supplied)\n\nShe can also easily recall the connection she felt with her family as a teenager.\n\nIn the book, Shannon hangs out with her teenage mother and reflects on her hopes and dreams for the future.\n\nDaylight says the storyline was close to home for her.\n\n\"I asked my oldest child what they would do if they went back to 1985, and they said, 'I'd look for you.' That was a lovely thing to hear.\n\n\"I also realised as I was writing that it was likely to be something I'd do as well.\"\n\n'A great thought experiment'\n\nOne key difference with setting a book in the 1980s is that the characters can't communicate with mobile phones or the internet.\n\n\"Taking phones out [of the story] is a great thought experiment to see what young people who are used to phones might do,\" Daylight says.\n\n\"It's also a great plot point, because they know they want to find each other but don't know how. So that gives them this lovely adventure to go on.\"\n\nIn How to Survive 1985, Daylight's protagonists return from her debut YA novel, Royals. (Supplied)\n\nDaylight, who published her first adult novel, Bombora, in 1996, never planned to write YA fiction.\n\n\"I just had this idea of six teenagers trapped in Penrith Plaza,\" she says of her previous book, Royals. (How to Survive 1985 features the same characters, but can be read as a standalone book.)\n\n\"But once I'd written that, I was like, 'OK, cool, I've finished my YA.'\n\n\"A few people said to me, 'Are you going to write a sequel?' and I said 'No way.' But then this other idea [for How to Survive 1985] just turned up and kept hanging out with me.\"\n\nNow, she's even working on a third book in the series that she never intended to write.\n\nYA's loyal following\n\nDaylight says the main difference she has found between writing literary fiction and YA is promoting the work.\n\n\"YA is a different space; it's much less heightened and poised than literary, where you're really curating yourself,\" she says.\n\nShe has found that while there is less focus on YA in the media and at writer's festivals, it has a vibrant and enthusiastic readership.\n\n\"Even though you might be quite visible as a literary writer and less so as a YA writer, what happens is the books actually sell.\n\n\"They call it young adult, but [the character ages] start at about 10 and go to 25, so it's quite a broad market, and it's been super interesting.\"\n\nAnd Daylight is delighted that her time travel fiction is striking a chord.\n\n\" I just got the most beautiful letter from a 14-year-old reader; she was saying, 'It's so nice to have someone so positive about our generation.' \"\n\nHow to Survive 1985 (Simon & Schuster) is out now.",

(ABC Riverina: Emily Doak)\n\nBut that has come to a halt for many property owners due to laws protecting environmentally significant native vegetation.\n\nOver decades, Gaye Wheatley and her late husband Ned expanded the areas of mallee-broombush on their property to provide an alternate source of income to cropping, sheep, and cattle.\n\n\"We could see how we could make it productive, encourage the bush and have the income,\" she said.\n\n\"[Harvest involved] weaving through the bush in a mosaic way, leaving certain trees and taking dead wood to regenerate, making sure that we got the strangle vine down so that bush could replenish itself.\"\n\nGaye Wheatley (right) on her property with daughter Michelle and granddaughter Evie.

Tasmania's government has paid for double-page ads across three newspapers to address \"frequently asked questions\" about why the Spirit of Tasmania ferries are still a long way off operating.\n\nIn a statement this morning, Minister for Transport Eric Abetz said TT-Line had advised the government an issue with the liquefied natural gas (LNG) systems on board both ships had been identified.\n\n\"RMC has advised TT-Line that the issue needs further assessment and rectification, and as a result Spirit IV will not depart for Australia until the work is completed,\" Mr Abetz said.\n\n\"The government is awaiting further details in relation to a new expected departure date, but it is understood that this work will take some time.\"\n\nHe said that any necessary repair costs will be covered under warranty with RMC, and that TT-Line had representatives on the ground in Finland and was engaging with the company.\n\n\"The ship will be relocated to Hobart as soon as possible for final fit-out,\" Mr Abetz said.\n\nLoading...\n\n'Good news' issue found before departure, Abetz says\n\nSpeaking in parliament this morning, Labor leader Dean Winter asked Mr Abetz how much time the fresh delays will add to Spirit IV being \"stuck in Scotland as an international embarrassment\".\n\nTensions flared on both sides of the parliamentary benches during the subsequent debate, as Mr Abetz said he was \"no mechanic\" and could not offer further technical details.\n\nMr Abetz said it was actually \"good news\" the issue had been identified before Spirit IV had departed from Scotland.\n\n\"Thank goodness for the weather,\" Mr Abetz said.\n\n\"She might have been well into the deep oceans and then suffer a mechanical issue \u2026 the full extent of which I am not appraised of.\"\n\nLong list of problems for project\n\nThe LNG issue is just the latest in a project plagued by cost blowouts and delays that have led to multiple people losing their jobs.\n\nBoth ships were originally due to be delivered to Tasmania in late 2024, but construction on a new berth in Devonport did not start until that year and is not expected to be completed until late 2026.\n\nCould ownership of TasPort's new Spirit of Tasmania berth in Devonport be privatised before it's even completed?

And Gilbert introduces me to one I\u2019d never heard of before: Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire, which she describes as \u201cthe beginning of reality TV\u2019s determination to view twenty-first century women through a nineteenth century frame: Jane Austen heroines who, deprived of agency or power of their own, could only compete to claim status and self-betterment through their looks, their alliances and their rivalries\u201d.

A sense of parasitism, of being redundant and secondhand, has often haunted settler art in Australia. You can accuse Amerena of romanticising the past if you like. He isn\u2019t alone. In any case, a romantic vision does not necessarily equate to an incorrect one. You may want everything, Amerena suggests, but first you\u2019ll need to sell yourself out \u2013 along with your friends, enemies, colleagues, fans, associates, pets, peers and family \u2013 to get there.",

Loading The crowd is tentative about applauding, waiting for a conclusive indication that she\u2019s finished before clapping between tracks.

Floodlights\u2019 night is a triumph already. Alive (I Want To Feel) is heralded by the lone trumpet of Sarah Hellyer: the bugler in the face of a gathering storm. And alive we feel. Melbourne rock band Floodlights at the Forum on Saturday night. Credit: Martin Philbey Floodlights are no pop band; no hits or Hottest 100 contenders, though their second album, Painting of My Time, was shortlisted for the 2023 Australian Music Prize. What tonight\u2019s packed room reflects is more unusual: a serious following for serious music, with a gritty, localised aesthetic that more tenderly echoes Midnight Oil, The Triffids, Goanna \u2013 bands that tried to make sense of a country and its shadows. Tonight\u2019s set leans hard on Underneath, the new album that continues the collective\u2019s earnest search for meaning in a more inward direction. It\u2019s less postcard-accessible than Small Town Pub and Nullarbor \u2014 older tunes that reliably lift the energy when long intros and murmured set-ups lead attention to drift. The new material is thematically dense, deliberate, sometimes elusive.\n\nBut JOY is pure high. Horses Will Run creeps and surges with dream-state drama. Frontman Louis Parsons doesn\u2019t so much sing as declaim. He\u2019s insistent, on edge, but rarely quite decipherable in the wiry ensemble attack. Hellyer\u2019s heroic trumpet and wailing blues harp are recurring motifs, adding flashes of texture and tension that hark back to Aussie pub rock forebears. Louis Parsons, lead singer and guitarist for Melbourne rock band Floodlights, performs on stage at the Forum on May 24, 2025 Credit: Martin Philbey Mid-show, the piano-led Melancholy Cave wants to pull the room into a hush, but the crowd seems elsewhere. There\u2019s a nagging sense that much of Underneath hasn\u2019t quite landed yet\u2014at least not live. But Buoyant is a late-set victory. As promised by the title, the room levitates. The crowd picks up the booming hook and sways into a proper old-school beer barn moment. And the sprawling 5AM is an epic set closer of slow-building, stadium-targeted proportions. \u201cIt\u2019s been an emotional day for us,\u201d Parsons offers gratefully before the single-song encore. Golden oldie Painting of My Time is the climax the night needs and again, the room rises to meet its all-in chanting refrain. It\u2019s late, but a moment of exhilarated arrival that makes the journey worthwhile. Floodlights don\u2019t always hit their mark. But there\u2019s no question they know what they\u2019re aiming for.\n\nReviewed by Michael Dwyer\n\nTHEATRE\n\nEndgames \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nfortyfivedownstairs, until June 1 Three brief encounters with hideous men achieve a sense of twilit tragicomedy in the hands of the legendary Max Gillies. The legendary Max Gillies stars in Endgames at fortyfivedownstairs. Credit: Jodie Hutchinson With Endgames, Gillies rejoins director Laurence Strangio to present what\u2019s in some ways a companion piece to their 2018 production of Krapp\u2019s Last Tape \u2013 this time uniting the late Beckett work Eh Joe with an excerpt from Jack Hibberd\u2019s classic monodrama A Stretch of the Imagination and Chekhov\u2019s shambolic lecture On the Harmful Effects of Tobacco. Although Hibberd died last year, the curtain may long continue to fall on his immortal stage creation, Monk O\u2019Neill. The misanthropic hermit in Stretch remains an incarnation of Australian male destructiveness and despair as appalling as he is compelling.\n\nHibberd used this character to diagnose cultural disease \u2013 from slashing misogyny to the rapacity and bad faith of colonialism \u2013 with a clear-eyed honesty that reshaped what was possible on our stages, and this excerpt includes Monk\u2019s final will and testament, in which he gives: \u2018All my lands and property, goods and chattels, to the Aboriginal peoples of Australia \u2026 On no account must my domain fall into the clutches of the predatory and upstart albino. I believe that the tides of history will swamp and wash aside this small pink tribe of mistletoe men, like insects \u2026Change insects to dead leaves\u2026\u2019 With Endgames, Gillies rejoins director Laurence Strangio. Credit: Jodie Hutchinson One Tree Hill isn\u2019t his to give, of course, and even Monk\u2019s presence is erased in this version, largely an audio performance under crepuscular lighting. Gillies only appears once, rifle in hand, pursuing \u201can emu on heat\u201d through the shadows; the brilliantly produced soundscape, however, overfills the physical absence \u2013 not least in the copious, and comically loud, urination which bookends the piece.\n\nIf that whets the appetite for a proper remount of Stretch, the audio monologue in Eh Joe is part of Beckett\u2019s creative intention. The elderly loner here sits entombed in silence on a couch, as the accusatory voice of a woman (Jillian Murray) torments him with memory and regret. Loading As he seduced women in his life, so this internal voice now seduces him towards death, and Gillies\u2019 wordless performance haunts with barely perceptible pain and confusion, with the agony of futile presence. Gillies has always had a talent for clowning, and in the Chekhov, he leans into a more overtly satirical sort of existential monologue. Nyukhin is a nervy, ineffectual public speaker. The man is supposed to be giving a charity lecture on the evils of tobacco, but it keeps turning into a digressive complaint about his wife and daughters, whom he fears. The actor fumbles his lines more than a few times, which matters less than it might when he\u2019s playing a character who wishes he could erase his memory, and whose comical lack of authority is his defining feature.",

You said I misled you.\n\nChammas: That\u2019s what everyone\u2019s saying at the moment.\n\nGould: No, you\u2019re saying it. You\u2019re saying I misled you. I misled no one.\n\nChammas: When we\u2019re talking about the Galvin situation, there are a number of issues over a number of years \u2026\n\nGould: I misled no one. I misled no one. Mind your words, son.\n\nSmith: Is there a chance he doesn\u2019t even end up at the Bulldogs? Cause I\u2019m hearing that his first preference is Parramatta?\n\nChammas: I think, for a while, everyone thought he was going to parramatta. And the talk was, potentially, his manager wanted him to go to Parra, play with Mitchell Moses. But obviously, as I said, Cameron Ciraldo, Luke Vella \u2013 the relationship there and where the bulldogs are as a club; they\u2019re sitting in top of the ladder. It\u2019s a different situation to where Parramatta are. Parramatta are completely rebuilding. Perhaps he didn\u2019t want to be part of that rebuild. Perhaps what he saw at Canterbury or heard from the club was what interested him the most.\n\nGould: You\u2019re guessing.\n\nChammas: No, I\u2019m not guessing.\n\nGould: You haven\u2019t spoken to Lachlan Galvin, you\u2019re guessing. You\u2019re putting out a heap of scenarios.\n\nChammas: But you\u2019ve told me you haven\u2019t spoken to Lachlan Galvin either, so you and I are as equally educated on the situation.\n\nGould: Yeah, but I\u2019m not commenting on what he\u2019s saying.",

Marco Rojas, running at pace, threaded the ball through to the striker in the 92nd minute and Thompson seized the moment to slot an audacious lob just under the crossbar.

Play was abandoned on the night, but the game was completed months later, restarting from the 22nd minute and ending with City winning 2-1.\n\nIzzo the hero: May 5, 2024 Victory and City were fighting for a place in the semi-finals last year when the game went to penalties (scores tied 1-1 at the end of extra time), before Victory keeper Paul Izzo emerged as the hero for the side in navy blue. Izzo let one penalty in early before Victory equalled. Boos rang out from Victory fans as City made a second attempt but Izzo blocked the ball. Victory capitalised, taking the score to 2-1. Izzo ultimately saved two more and then calmly converted his own penalty shot, sending his team to the semi-final against Wellington Phoenix after the 3-2 penalty win.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nTanya Hall is the founder and CEO of an advocacy group in Perth known as hearts4heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I was diagnosed with congenital heart disease at six months old and I had my first heart operation at nine. But when I was 17, I started having symptoms of atrial fibrillation. And after atrial fibrillation progressing over 10 years I was then diagnosed, and had treatment to improve my symptoms and quality of life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTanya is one of the more than half a million Australians who have atrial fibrillation.\n\n\n\n\n\nCardiologist Dr Tomos Walters from the Queensland Cardiovascular Group in Brisbane says it's a lifelong, progressive condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Atrial fibrillation or AF is a disease in which the normal, regular rhythm is replaced by electrical chaos in the atria, the filling chambers at the top of the heart. That then makes the ventricles, the pumping chambers, beat in an irregularly irregular manner, which significantly reduces the mechanical efficiency of the heart.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Walters says atrial fibrillation - or AF - can affect different people in different ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are some people who just don't feel it. There are some people who are incapacitated by it, and most people are somewhere in between. The symptoms include palpitations, chest pain, breathlessness, dizziness, fatigue.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's those varied impacts that have advocates and medical professionals concerned.\n\n\n\n\n\nAtrial fibrillation is already the leading cause of cardiovascular hospitalisations, resulting in a direct annual cost of approximately $1.63 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"AF imposes very large burden on the Australian healthcare system. It's one of the most common reasons for emergency department presentation, for hospital admission.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAF is also responsible for an estimated one in four strokes and a higher risk of dementia.\n\n\n\n\n\nLittle wonder then that Dr Walters has called it one of the largest, and most pressing, public health epidemics, as the population grows older.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The things we worry about in a patient with AF include the risk of having a stroke; the risk that the AF, if left untreated, can start to affect their heart structure and function. It can cause heart failure in some patients. And of course, we worry about the symptoms and the effect on quality of life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of the concern is that an estimated 30 percent of people with AF don't even know they have the condition.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeelong mother of two Justine Martin says she found out by chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2011, and I developed this butterfly feeling in my chest, which I put down to being MS. I got rushed to hospital with a really bad headache, and they put me on an ECG machine and discovered that my resting heart rate was 155 beats a minute, which then led to the diagnosis of AF.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concern for advocates is that those who don't know they have AF won't be able to take preventative action to stop the disease from progressing, or avoid complications.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Emily Kotschet is a cardiologist at Holmesglen Private Hospital in Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says for those that do eventually have symptoms, some might not realise what they are feeling is actually coming from the heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So one in three Australians didn't want to present when they had their first symptoms and waited for four episodes before they sought medical attention\u2026 often waiting to see if it'll just settle on its own, or maybe dismissing the significance of it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says that's a particular issue for women - for whom cardiac issues don't necessarily look the same as they might for men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So women often present with different symptoms, so maybe not classic irregular palpitations. They might feel short of breath or just fatigue, unable to do their usual activities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat lack of awareness about what heart problems might look like has been a longstanding concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, Hearts4heart did a comprehensive nationwide survey that found one in three Australians (or around 6.7 million people) were completely unaware atrial fibrillation existed.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Boston Scientific commissioned survey from 2025 has suggested very little has changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nTanya Hall says it's best to not wait to talk to your GP about your concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Be heart smart. If there\u2019s a family history of heart disease, if you\u2019re having any symptoms, or you\u2019re over the age of 50, then please go and get your heart checked.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in Perth, Tanya Hall says her condition is now under control.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it's time for awareness of atrial fibrillation to be raised, so that it helps everyone.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We live in a performance-enhanced society. Men and women get nose jobs. Women get boob jobs and butt jobs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVictor Conte masterminded some of the biggest doping scandals in athletics, and he says he sees the appeal of Enhanced Games, where athletes use drugs to boost their performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe American was involved in setting up the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative, and spent time in prison for illegally distributing anabolic steroids.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe argues using drugs to enhance athletic performance simply reflects the realities of modern life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Men take Prozac to enhance their productivity at work. Men take Viagra to enhance their performance and turn themselves from a dud into a stud under the sheets. So I get it. These athletes are wanting to enhance their performance, but people in everyday life are routinely enhancing their performance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Enhanced Games are set to launch in Las Vegas next May with their inaugural competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nSportspeople using substances banned in official competitions will compete in swimming, athletics and weightlifting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe founder of the games, Dr Aron D'Souza, believes they can transform sports science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think for a few years, there will be a world of natural sport run by the Olympics and a world of enhanced sport run by us. But ultimately, world records matter. As human beings, we're only interested in seeing the fastest humans. We want to see the very best of our species. And we're not interested in the best amateur, right, or the best pro. We're actually just interested in the best.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPrize money is also a factor.\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants could earn up to $500,000 per event plus bonuses for surpassing a world record mark.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced Games competitor Kristian Gkolomeev competed in four Olympics but never made the podium.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to D'Zouza, the Greek-Bulgarian swimmer has since surpassed one of his sport's greatest achievements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cKristian Gkolomeev is now the fastest swimmer in human history. And he did so at 31 years old, five to 10 years later than is generally regarded as peak swimming career. So he's like, should be retired, but in fact, he's swimming faster than any human being has ever done so. Why? Because he used technology and science to enhance his performance. Once the world realises that, I think everyone is going to want it.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nD'Souza argues that doping in professional and amateur sport is rampant despite efforts to eliminate the use of banned substances, leading to secretive and unsafe drug use.\n\n\n\n\n\nGkolomeev swam two hundredths of a second faster than the 50m freestyle official world record that has stood for more than 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the Enhanced Games are about creating a level playing field where all athletes are open about what they are doing to enhance their performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI mean I know that you know probably in my career there are some athletes that they were not playing by the rules, you know? But you know I can't prove and never got caught, but as athletes sometimes we understand what's catchy, what's not. But yeah, there's definitely frustration, and that was a big reason that I chose to go to the Enhanced Games, is the level playing field.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nFor swimming, the 50m freestyle,100m freestyle, 50m butterfly and 100m butterfly are on the agenda.\n\n\n\n\n\nAthletics has the 100m sprint along with the 100m and 110m hurdles, while weightlifting will feature the snatch, and clean and jerk.\n\n\n\n\n\nRetired Australian world champion swimmer James Magnussen has signed up to take banned performance-enhancing drugs in an attempt to surpass Cesar Cielo's 50m freestyle record.\n\n\n\n\n\nMagnussen makes no apologies about participating in the Enhanced Games training program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Forget about the protocols, forget about the world record, all of that stuff. As a mature-age now athlete again, I was just so happy to be back to be training, to be working with world-class professionals and to have a chance to compete again.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency staunchly opposes the project, warning athletes that they risk bans and their health.\n\n\n\n\n\nWADA Science Director Olivier Rabin says long-term health risks can be hard to assess with on-the-spot checks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We think this is dangerous and an irresponsible concept by all means. I mean, again, health is at the very heart of what we are doing at WADA and also in the fight against doping in sport. This is very much embedded into the code, into the way we work to establish prohibited substances and methods, and having a free pass to use whatever substance or whatever method to enhance performance without consideration for health for us is absolutely nonsensical.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Rabin also says it would be complicated for athletes to compete in clean sport again after participating in the Enhanced Games.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They would probably risk committing an anti-doping rule violation. Because, as you know, we can prosecute an anti-doping rule violation for a period of 10 years based on sample analysis or testimonies. So it's not just testing; it's also the fact that you benefited at some point from a performance-enhancing substance. And we know today that there are, for some of them, long-term beneficial effects, in particular on the muscle, of using performance-enhancing substances.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSports Integrity Australia issued a statement warning athletes of risks to their health, and slamming the games as dangerous, unethical and damaging to sport.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group's Athlete Advisory Group says normalising performance-enhancing drugs promotes doping as entertainment.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Rabin agrees.\n\n\n\n",

So there's also a lot that individuals can do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Institute's call follows confirmation that the Australian Energy Regulator has approved an increase to the amount of electricity residents pay in three states - New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlison Reeve says that's because of rising costs to the delivery and production of power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That sort of anticipated higher future cost of energy is a little more acute in New South Wales and that's because that's where the next coal fire power station to close will be closing... The other thing with NSW is they are doing quite a large investment in their network. Some of that is increasing resilience to things like storms and floods, which is very pertinent this week when we look at what's happened on the north coast of New South Wales. But it's also an investment to support greater uptake of electric vehicles and rooftop solar by consumers, and to pay for the new transmission lines that they are having to build in order to build replacement capacity, to replace retiring coal. So all of those are pushing up the cost of the poles and wires rather than the electricity itself in New South Wales.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that New South Wales residents face the steepest hike, expected to be paying out up to 228 dollars more each year - with regional customers seeing their annual bills to jump to over 2740 dollars a year - the highest in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn south-east Queensland, an average household on a default contract will soon pay around 77 dollars more a year or just over 2100 dollars a year while in South Australia the annual bill will be up 71 dollars, bringing the average annual cost to just over 2300 dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Victoria the prices are set by the Essential Services Commission - and their average household bills will increase by between 6 to 25 dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese new rates are the maximum retailers can charge for a default contract.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Cassandra Goldie from the Australian Council of Social Service is concerned - saying the increase will hit those hardest who can least afford it: the roughly three million people who are living in poverty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So low income people are often hit with a triple whammy here, where they're paying proportionate to their income five times more than everybody else on energy bills; they're using more energy because their properties are poor quality; and of course they're often the ones with multiple other costs that they can't afford to meet.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government says it understands many are still feeling cost of living pressures - and they have already extended the energy bill relief fund to help.\n\n\n\n\n\nACOSS says that is not the right approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One off rebates are not the solution. We've spent over six billion dollars in those one off payments that keep getting extended. We would much rather see first of all boosting home energy upgrades money to get to all low income housing being at a good energy performance standard, solar panels, access to renewable energy, insulation etc. Secondly, to help people who've accumulated big energy debt to have that debt written off.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government says it already views renewable energy as part of the solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister says they want to bring on those types of sources to bring down the overall cost for everyone on a long term basis.\n\n\n\n",

Credit: Urszula Soltys\n\nFor me, there is a little too much about reality television, but it\u2019s a big part of the culture so there\u2019s no way of avoiding it, from Big Brother and An American Family. And Gilbert introduces me to one I\u2019d never heard of before: Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire, which she describes as \u201cthe beginning of reality TV\u2019s determination to view twenty-first century women through a nineteenth century frame: Jane Austen heroines who, deprived of agency or power of their own, could only compete to claim status and self-betterment through their looks, their alliances and their rivalries\u201d. Pretty much.\n\nOr, as Jerry Hall said in 1985, \u201cMy mother said it was simple to keep a man, you must be a maid in the living room, a cook in the kitchen and a whore in the bedroom.\u201d Hall updated it: \u201cI said I\u2019d hire the other two and take care of the bedroom bit.\u201d\n\nBut by far the most striking, most frightening, aspect of the book is the way in which Gilbert has both drawn on, and expanded, the work of philosopher Amia Srinivasan, The Right to Sex and Gail Dines\u2019 Pornland: How Porn Has Hijacked Our Sexuality. Porn trains us.\n\nPorn trains us in how to be women. And worse, it trains men in how to treat women. \u201cIt has trained a good amount of our popular culture ... to see women as objects, as things to silence, restrain, fetishise, or brutalise,\u201d says Gilbert. The fleshed-out concept of pornography as a textbook for how women must be in their lives is terrifying. Now I\u2019ve read Gilbert\u2019s persuasive arguments, I\u2019m embarrassed I\u2019ve ever been persuaded otherwise. I\u2019ve never felt so wrong in my life. There is now, she argues, a \u201cpornification\u201d of everything, including music.",

He is described as having little mercy \u2013 a quality that seems to be borne out, given his treatment of Shales. Could it be mercy for himself too, though, that he lacks? Caught in his Tantalus visions of literary fame, he regularly conflates literature with the satisfaction of other desires (legitimacy, likeability, self-worth). He believes or wants to believe himself to be Brenda\u2019s confidante and confessor. He would be better served learning to act as his own.\n\n\u201cFame is a form of incomprehension,\u201d Borges observed, \u201cperhaps the worst.\u201d Cannily, Borges never bothered specifying whether this incomprehension belonged to the artist, their audience or both. There is an ironic edge to this aspect of the book. Amerena plays with questions of domination and subordination, both sexual and economic. (Regularly highlighting every abject and unseemly stitch of his characters, Amerena plays the dom.)\n\nLoading\n\nIn I Want Everything, the conniving opportunism and careerism of the present eclipse \u2026 well, everything. If Shales could become Australia\u2019s greatest author, it wasn\u2019t while donating her body to science and her soul to the industry. It was because she came of age in a country that offered its people something more than a series of transactional arrangements. Where authors once sought time and space to write, now they seek time and space to better leverage their brand.\n\nWas it always like this? A sense of parasitism, of being redundant and secondhand, has often haunted settler art in Australia. You can accuse Amerena of romanticising the past if you like. He isn\u2019t alone. In any case, a romantic vision does not necessarily equate to an incorrect one. You may want everything, Amerena suggests, but first you\u2019ll need to sell yourself out \u2013 along with your friends, enemies, colleagues, fans, associates, pets, peers and family \u2013 to get there.",

Occasionally there\u2019ll be a lighting effect, like a spotlight that emulates the moon or a tortoise shell speckled design projected onto the back curtain. Loading The crowd is tentative about applauding, waiting for a conclusive indication that she\u2019s finished before clapping between tracks. Hardly anyone raises their phone to record, and when they do, she kindly asks them to stop. The performance goes for just under two hours, including the encore. A long time to be standing, even for the most dedicated fan. A couple of audience members even faint. Seating would have ensured a comfortable concert experience and suited the intimate atmosphere. A captivating performance, where you surrender to Aoba\u2019s fantasy and detach from the chaos of the outside world.\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\n\nMUSIC\n\nFloodlights \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nForum Melbourne, May 24 Smoke, an immense cage of light, an eager rush onto one of Melbourne\u2019s most storied stages, and a hometown heroes\u2019 welcome that swells the room. Floodlights\u2019 night is a triumph already. Alive (I Want To Feel) is heralded by the lone trumpet of Sarah Hellyer: the bugler in the face of a gathering storm. And alive we feel. Melbourne rock band Floodlights at the Forum on Saturday night. Credit: Martin Philbey Floodlights are no pop band; no hits or Hottest 100 contenders, though their second album, Painting of My Time, was shortlisted for the 2023 Australian Music Prize. What tonight\u2019s packed room reflects is more unusual: a serious following for serious music, with a gritty, localised aesthetic that more tenderly echoes Midnight Oil, The Triffids, Goanna \u2013 bands that tried to make sense of a country and its shadows. Tonight\u2019s set leans hard on Underneath, the new album that continues the collective\u2019s earnest search for meaning in a more inward direction. It\u2019s less postcard-accessible than Small Town Pub and Nullarbor \u2014 older tunes that reliably lift the energy when long intros and murmured set-ups lead attention to drift. The new material is thematically dense, deliberate, sometimes elusive.\n\nBut JOY is pure high. Horses Will Run creeps and surges with dream-state drama. Frontman Louis Parsons doesn\u2019t so much sing as declaim. He\u2019s insistent, on edge, but rarely quite decipherable in the wiry ensemble attack. Hellyer\u2019s heroic trumpet and wailing blues harp are recurring motifs, adding flashes of texture and tension that hark back to Aussie pub rock forebears. Louis Parsons, lead singer and guitarist for Melbourne rock band Floodlights, performs on stage at the Forum on May 24, 2025 Credit: Martin Philbey Mid-show, the piano-led Melancholy Cave wants to pull the room into a hush, but the crowd seems elsewhere. There\u2019s a nagging sense that much of Underneath hasn\u2019t quite landed yet\u2014at least not live. But Buoyant is a late-set victory. As promised by the title, the room levitates. The crowd picks up the booming hook and sways into a proper old-school beer barn moment. And the sprawling 5AM is an epic set closer of slow-building, stadium-targeted proportions. \u201cIt\u2019s been an emotional day for us,\u201d Parsons offers gratefully before the single-song encore. Golden oldie Painting of My Time is the climax the night needs and again, the room rises to meet its all-in chanting refrain. It\u2019s late, but a moment of exhilarated arrival that makes the journey worthwhile. Floodlights don\u2019t always hit their mark. But there\u2019s no question they know what they\u2019re aiming for.\n\nReviewed by Michael Dwyer\n\nTHEATRE\n\nEndgames \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nfortyfivedownstairs, until June 1 Three brief encounters with hideous men achieve a sense of twilit tragicomedy in the hands of the legendary Max Gillies. The legendary Max Gillies stars in Endgames at fortyfivedownstairs. Credit: Jodie Hutchinson With Endgames, Gillies rejoins director Laurence Strangio to present what\u2019s in some ways a companion piece to their 2018 production of Krapp\u2019s Last Tape \u2013 this time uniting the late Beckett work Eh Joe with an excerpt from Jack Hibberd\u2019s classic monodrama A Stretch of the Imagination and Chekhov\u2019s shambolic lecture On the Harmful Effects of Tobacco. Although Hibberd died last year, the curtain may long continue to fall on his immortal stage creation, Monk O\u2019Neill. The misanthropic hermit in Stretch remains an incarnation of Australian male destructiveness and despair as appalling as he is compelling.\n\nHibberd used this character to diagnose cultural disease \u2013 from slashing misogyny to the rapacity and bad faith of colonialism \u2013 with a clear-eyed honesty that reshaped what was possible on our stages, and this excerpt includes Monk\u2019s final will and testament, in which he gives: \u2018All my lands and property, goods and chattels, to the Aboriginal peoples of Australia \u2026 On no account must my domain fall into the clutches of the predatory and upstart albino. I believe that the tides of history will swamp and wash aside this small pink tribe of mistletoe men, like insects \u2026Change insects to dead leaves\u2026\u2019 With Endgames, Gillies rejoins director Laurence Strangio. Credit: Jodie Hutchinson One Tree Hill isn\u2019t his to give, of course, and even Monk\u2019s presence is erased in this version, largely an audio performance under crepuscular lighting. Gillies only appears once, rifle in hand, pursuing \u201can emu on heat\u201d through the shadows; the brilliantly produced soundscape, however, overfills the physical absence \u2013 not least in the copious, and comically loud, urination which bookends the piece.\n\nIf that whets the appetite for a proper remount of Stretch, the audio monologue in Eh Joe is part of Beckett\u2019s creative intention. The elderly loner here sits entombed in silence on a couch, as the accusatory voice of a woman (Jillian Murray) torments him with memory and regret. Loading As he seduced women in his life, so this internal voice now seduces him towards death, and Gillies\u2019 wordless performance haunts with barely perceptible pain and confusion, with the agony of futile presence. Gillies has always had a talent for clowning, and in the Chekhov, he leans into a more overtly satirical sort of existential monologue. Nyukhin is a nervy, ineffectual public speaker. The man is supposed to be giving a charity lecture on the evils of tobacco, but it keeps turning into a digressive complaint about his wife and daughters, whom he fears. The actor fumbles his lines more than a few times, which matters less than it might when he\u2019s playing a character who wishes he could erase his memory, and whose comical lack of authority is his defining feature.",

Mind your words, son.\n\nSmith: Is there a chance he doesn\u2019t even end up at the Bulldogs? Cause I\u2019m hearing that his first preference is Parramatta?\n\nChammas: I think, for a while, everyone thought he was going to parramatta. And the talk was, potentially, his manager wanted him to go to Parra, play with Mitchell Moses.

That is dangerous from Muscat.\u201d Kevin Muscat was given a straight red card for the tackle on Heart\u2019s Adrian Zahra. Credit: Fox Sports Muscat was widely condemned, and the incident sparked talk about the Victory bruiser\u2019s retirement. Muscat swiftly apologised. \u201cFirstly having had a sleepless night myself I felt it was important that I did front up and accept everything that is going to be coming my way in relation to bans \u2026 and also being criticised [over] my character, my performance [and] all that comes with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to sit here and accept full responsibility for it.\u201d\n\nThompson at the death: December 22, 2012 The sides were set to leave their 2012 encounter at AAMI Park with an unsatisfying 1-1 score when Victory star Archie Thompson wrote his own page into the derby history books. Marco Rojas, running at pace, threaded the ball through to the striker in the 92nd minute and Thompson seized the moment to slot an audacious lob just under the crossbar. Defender Aziz Behich booted the ball out of the goal, but it was in vain as the referee declared it had cleared the line. The last-minute attack, which took place just minutes after Heart had snagged an equalising score, handed Victory a stunning 2-1 win.\n\nLoading Thompson stripped off the \u201chigh-vis\u201d jersey Victory had donned that night and swung it around in celebration as the 26,000-strong crowd erupted. The win put Victory in third place on the ladder and left Heart languishing third from bottom. Cahill\u2019s wonder goal: October 15, 2016 Tim Cahill put his stamp on the derby in front of more than 43,000 fans with a stunning volley 26 minutes into a bumper clash between City and Victory at Marvel Stadium in 2016.\n\nCahill, in his A-League debut following a stellar career playing for Australia and internationally, advanced as the ball bounced away from the centre circle towards the goal, more than 40 metres away. \u201cWhat a hit!\u201d commentator Simon Hill roared as Cahill\u2019s long-distance volley went into the top corner. \u201cThe Socceroos great announcing his arrival in some style.\u201d The 36-year-old celebrated by taking on his favourite boxing opponent: the corner flag. Cahill\u2019s miraculous goal paved the way for a scoring blitz from City, who went on to win 4-1 following goals from Bruno Fornaroli, Luke Brattan and Fernando Brandan.\n\nCahill would score against Victory again in their next clash in December, but this volley will always rank among the best goals in derby history. The \u201cdarkest day\u201d in Australian soccer: December 17, 2022 Hundreds of Victory\u2019s active supporters stormed the field during the derby in 2022, in what has been dubbed the darkest moment in A-League history and left a cloud hanging over the club to this day. The attack on City goalkeeper Tom Glover. Credit: Ten Hooligans broke down the field barriers in the 22nd minute of play, running onto the pitch with lit flare and tearing at the goal net.\n\nPlayers and officials were attacked, with one man throwing a bucket of sand at City keeper Tom Glover, cutting his head open, while others targeted referee Alex King. Scores of invaders were later banned for life and several were charged by police. Fans from both clubs had been protesting the A-League\u2019s decision to move the grand final to Sydney. Melbourne Victory were fined more than $500,000 \u2013 the largest fine in A-League history \u2013 and continues to deal with the fallout with a suspended 10-point deduction hanging over them. Play was abandoned on the night, but the game was completed months later, restarting from the 22nd minute and ending with City winning 2-1.\n\nIzzo the hero: May 5, 2024 Victory and City were fighting for a place in the semi-finals last year when the game went to penalties (scores tied 1-1 at the end of extra time), before Victory keeper Paul Izzo emerged as the hero for the side in navy blue. Izzo let one penalty in early before Victory equalled. Boos rang out from Victory fans as City made a second attempt but Izzo blocked the ball. Victory capitalised, taking the score to 2-1. Izzo ultimately saved two more and then calmly converted his own penalty shot, sending his team to the semi-final against Wellington Phoenix after the 3-2 penalty win.",

Source: Michael Dahlstrom/Woolworths\n\nWoolworths has revealed why it\u2019s continuing to sell a New Zealand-made dairy product cheaper in Australia than what Kiwis are forced to pay in its country of origin.\n\nButter prices in the land of the long white cloud have increased by a staggering 65 per cent in a year, worsening cost-of-living pressure on shoppers. This week, a block of 400-gram New Zealand-made Westgold butter was selling for $6.50 (NZ$7.00) in Woolworths\u2019 Australian stores, but across the ditch they were retailing for NZ$9.95 (A$9.19).\n\nIt is a similar story for New Zealand-made Mainland varieties, with 250-gram butter priced at $6.50 (NZ$7.00) in Australia versus $8.90 (A$8.15) in New Zealand.\n\nWestgold sells for NZ$9.95 in New Zealand and A$6.50 in Australia.

Australian prices for the same product sourced before May will reflect the lower global price.\n\n\u201cDifferent tax arrangements and rates can be a factor, and purchase volumes and different promotional pricing activities can also influence retail prices on either side of the Tasman.\u201d\n\nWoolworths was unable to comment on whether butter prices would increase in Australia when new product is sourced from New Zealand.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNew Zealand struggles with high prices of supermarket duopoly\n\nWhile there\u2019s an appearance of competition in the New Zealand supermarket space, like Australia, the sector is dominated by a duopoly. The brands PAK\u2019nSAVE, New World and Four Square are all owned by local cooperative Foodstuffs, while Countdown and Woolworths are operated by Australia\u2019s Woolworths Group.\n\nCountdown stores in New Zealand are being rebranded as Woolworths.

Source: Getty\n\nA new favourite has emerged as the most sought-after regional hotspot for Australians relocating within the country as Aussies look for the best place to settle.\n\nGreater Geelong in Victoria has now overtaken Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast to become the country's most popular destination for internal movers, according to the latest Regional Movers Index (RMI). The Victorian city now claims 9.3 per cent of the nation's total net internal migration, nudging past the Sunshine Coast's 8.9 per cent share and ending its two-year reign at the top.\n\nThe report, a partnership between the Regional Australia Institute (RAI) and the Commonwealth Bank, highlights a continued post-pandemic shift from cities to regional areas, with capital-to-regional moves up nearly 11 per cent from last quarter and 20.5 per cent higher than pre-Covid levels.\n\nThe index focuses specifically on movement to and from regional areas, excluding capital cities like Sydney and Melbourne from the rankings.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThat means Geelong\u2019s top spot doesn\u2019t mean it drew more total movers than capital cities, but among all regional destinations, it had the largest share of net internal migration in the 12 months to March this year.\n\nThe figure reflects the number of people moving into an area from elsewhere in Australia, minus those moving out, making it a strong indicator of growing popularity among those seeking a \"regional lifestyle\" while remaining relatively close to urban centres.\n\nViews from Port Phillip Bay towards Geelong CBD in Victoria. Source: Getty\n\nWhy has Geelong become so popular?\n\nRAI CEO Liz Ritchie said the data confirms a long-term trend. \"The nation\u2019s love affair with regional life is showing no signs of abating,\" she said. \"Contemporary regional Australia has what people are looking for... clich\u00e9d images and misconceptions about regional living are well and truly a thing of the past.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFormer Sydney resident Alanna is one of these regional movers; formerly a Sydney resident, she now resides on the Sunshine Coast.\n\n\"For me, it's been the fact there's no traffic and (mostly) no issues with parking,\" Alanna said. \"I don't know if I can ever return to a one-hour commute.\n\n\"I love the lifestyle I can have with my partner, being able to live by the beach and having the beautiful hinterland close by. There are great camping spots and rivers to go boating and fishing on.\"\n\nThe Sunshine Coast remains a favourite among people fleeing the country's major cities. Source: Sunshine Coast Council\n\nGeelong\u2019s rise is part of a wider boom across regional Victoria, which attracted 34 per cent of all regional net inflows in the March quarter, up from 28 per cent a year earlier. The state also produced the two fastest-growing regional local government areas \u2014 Latrobe and Murrindindi.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCBA Acting Executive General Manager Josh Foster said Geelong stood out for more than its location.\n\n\"In a first for the RMI, Greater Geelong has become the star performer due to its idyllic location, established services and range of employment opportunities,\" he said. \"This is underpinned by significant government and corporate investment in the region.\"\n\nMajor infrastructure projects like the Geelong Convention Centre and Barwon\u2019s Women and Children\u2019s Hospital are helping drive growth. The state government has set a housing target of 128,600 new dwellings in Geelong by 2051.\n\nSydney continues to lead outflows\n\nSydney continues to lead net capital city outflows (64 per cent), with regional NSW securing 40 per cent of total inflows. Queensland\u2019s regional share dipped to 17 per cent from 30 per cent last year, though the state remains attractive due to its climate and housing affordability. The Sunshine Coast still ranked second overall, while locations like the Gold Coast, Townsville and Fraser Coast remain strong magnets.\n\nElsewhere, SA\u2019s Victor Harbour and WA\u2019s Denmark and Harvey also saw strong interest from movers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRitchie called for greater government focus on sustaining this momentum. \"There are big economic gains to be made by supporting, facilitating and nurturing growth across the regions,\" she said. \"Those benefits can only be achieved by ensuring communities have the infrastructure, facilities and funding they need.\"\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",

        "text": "The feedback window has now closed for the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service's controversial camping proposal.\n\nCamper and former policy analyst Tiaan Shutt told Yahoo News she was concerned authorities were being 'misleading' with its campground proposal. Source: Getty & Instagram/gone_wilding\n\nThere could be a significant overhaul in the way campgrounds in the country's most populous state are managed and experienced campers are holding their collective breath, waiting for authorities to assess community feedback on proposed changes.\n\nNSW National Parks and Wildlife Services (NPWS) has proposed increased camping fees and changes to the booking system to improve the camping experience, but one invested camper has claimed to Yahoo News some of the details presented to the public are \"misleading\".\n\nThe proposal, which is inviting community feedback, would see all campsites categorised into a tiering system based on amenities available at each site and priced accordingly. It would also increase camp fees in relation to the consumer price index, meaning prices would rise each year.\n\nWith the feedback window now closed, campers are waiting to find out what the verdict will be.\n\nCampers poke holes in proposed campground changes\n\nTiaan Shutt, who has a professional background in Policy Analytics, is travelling full-time around the country and frequently stays overnight in NSW campgrounds. She questioned some of the details presented in the proposal, saying authorities \"used data that was a little misleading\".\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFor example, Tiaan questioned why campers should shoulder the cost of increased visitation to national parks \u2014 50 million every year \u2014 when the 1.8 million annual overnight campers only make up just over three per cent of total visitors.\n\n\"If you're just an average person reading that, you're like, 'Oh, wow. That's large, that makes sense',\" she said. \"But of that 50 million visitations [per year to national parks], it was only just over three per cent who were actually overnight campers, which is tiny.\n\n\"When you're trying to lay the claim that so many people are visiting so we've got to increase prices, but putting those price increases on the small number of campers is a bit cheeky,\" she said.\n\nHeatley Gilmore, a camper for over 30 years who runs a camping app that helps Aussies locate free campsites around the country, also raised his concerns to Yahoo News, questioning which partners and industry representatives the NPWS consulted with on the proposal.\n\nMichael Atkinson (left) and Heatley Gilmore (right) have both raised concerns about the NPWS proposal. Source: TikTok/outbackmike & Facebook/Camps Australia Wide\n\nNPWS defends camping proposal as review begins\n\nNPWS assured Yahoo News \"all feedback will be carefully considered\" now the feedback window has closed, and \"consistency and equity\" for campers remains at the forefront of what authorities are trying to achieve.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"No decisions have been made on the proposal,\" the NPWS spokesperson said on Sunday.\n\nYahoo News understands the 50 million visitation statistic was included for context to the public. NPWS made no comment in response to Tiaan's concern and no details were provided on who the consulting partners were.\n\n\"[The NPWS proposal aims to be a] more consistent and simplified state-wide camping fee and booking system for the 365 campgrounds across NSW national parks,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nWill the new proposal make camping more expensive in NSW?\n\nThe main concern surrounding the proposal is that campers will be forking out much more money to enjoy camping in the state, with the new tiering system meaning campers could pay nine times the nightly fee to stay at some campgrounds during peak periods.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAustralian adventurer and avid camper Michael Atkinson, also known as Outback Mike, has been vocal on this issue and accused NPSW of simply wanting to make \"heaps of money\". He pointed to Thredbo Diggings campground in the Snowy Mountains as an example, explaining under the new proposal the nightly fee would jump from $6 to $54 during high season.\n\n\"By raising fees, they have just blocked out probably the poorest people in Australia from accessing national parks. It's the one thing they should have access to,\" he previously told Yahoo News.\n\nThis fear was echoed by Tiaan, who said \"everybody should be able to connect with country, connect with our land and nature, and increasing these costs will make it prohibitive for some people\".\n\nHowever, the NPWS pushed back against this claim, saying the proposal will make \"camping in national parks more affordable than ever before.\"\n\n\"[The proposal] lowers camping fees outside high season to encourage visitation in non-peak periods, lowers camping fees in locations where demand is lower, removes the fees for remote and basic campsites \u2014 providing genuinely free camping experiences,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Where there are proposed fee increases, in many cases they only reflect consumer price index adjustments since 2017 [the last time prices were changed].\"\n\nDo you have a story tip?
