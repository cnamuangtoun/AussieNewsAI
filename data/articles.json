One was another primary school-aged child in Texas and the other was an adult in New Mexico; neither were vaccinated.\n\nIt's Kennedy's first visit to the area as health secretary, where he said he met with families of both the children, aged six and eight, who died.

On Sunday, however, he said in a lengthy statement posted on X that it was \"the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.\"\n\nThe measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been used safely for more than 60 years and is 97 per cent effective against measles after two doses.\n\nManisha Patel, CDC incident manager, said that the MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles. She also told parents in Gaines County that it was important not to \"delay care\" for a child who is sick with measles.\n\n\"Call your doctor and make sure you're talking to a health care professional who can guide you on those next steps,\" Patel said.\n\nThe number of cases in Texas shot up by 81 between March 28 and April 4, and 16 more people were hospitalised.

Up to nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC.

Clothes cost US consumers essentially the same in 2024 as they did in 1994, according to US Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nEconomists and industry analysts have attributed the trend to free trade agreements, offshoring to foreign countries where workers are paid much less and heated competition for shoppers among discount retailers and fast-fashion brands like H&M, Zara and Forever 21.\n\nRallygoers travelled from across the country in a show of force at the nation's capital over concerns of the administration's policies. (AP)\n\nBut customers unaccustomed to inflation in the apparel sector and coming off several years of steep rise in the costs of groceries and housing may be extra sensitive to any big jumps in clothing prices.\n\nPriest, of the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, said he has observed shoppers pulling back on buying shoes since Trump's return to the White House.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re nervous,\u201d he said. \"They\u2019ve obviously been playing the long game as it relates to inflation for a number of years now. And they just don\u2019t have the endurance to absorb higher prices, particularly as they\u2019re inflicted by the US government.\u201d\n\nWinners and losers in a garment trade war\n\nAccording to a report by British bank Barclays published on Friday, the winners in the tariff wars are retailers that have at least one of these attributes: big negotiating power with their suppliers, a strong brand name and limited sourcing in Asia.\n\nIn clothing and footwear, that includes off-price retailers Burlington, Ross Stores Inc. and TJX Companies, which operates TJ Maxx and Marshalls, as well as Ralph Lauren and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, according to the report.\n\nThe companies in for a tougher time are those with limited negotiating power, limited pricing power and high product exposure in Asia, a list including Gap Inc., Urban Outfitters and American Eagle Outfitters, according to the report.\n\nSecondhand clothing resale site ThredUp cheered a related action Trump took with his latest round of tariffs: eliminating a widely used tax exemption that has allowed millions of low-cost goods \u2014 most of them originating in China \u2014 to enter the U. every day duty-free.\n\n\u201cThis policy change will increase the cost of cheaply produced, disposable clothing imported from China, directly impacting the business model that fuels overproduction and environmental degradation,\u201d ThredUp said.\n\nSeveral industry analysts and economists said they think tariffs will end up being a consumer sales tax that widens the yawning gap between America's wealthiest residents and those in the middle and lower end of the income spectrum.\n\n\u201cSo where will the US be buying its apparel now that the tariff rates on Bangladesh, Vietnam and China are astronomical?\u201d Mary E. Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said of the schedule set to take effect on Wednesday.",

        "text": "For many whose IVF journey doesn't end with a baby, it's a devastating loss.\n\nAnd any debt linked to treatment can be a painful reminder of that loss, making the grieving process even more difficult.\n\n\"If you take out debt for IVF or similar fertility treatments, and have the child you want because of it, it can be seen as a success,\" says Jay Zigmont, US-based founder and CEO of financial planning firm Childfree Wealth.\n\n\"On the other hand, if IVF does not give you the child you want, it can be seen as a failure.\"\n\nChildlessness grief counsellor and lived experience advocate Sarah Roberts, who underwent IVF for a decade, says it's not just financial debt people are left to deal with, either.\n\nThere are also missed opportunities, such as career progression put on hold during treatment, as well as what she calls the \"debt of regret\".\n\nAnd Ms Roberts says childless people are forced to completely rethink the financial model they've had in mind for themselves; one where they saw a future with kids.\n\nLife after stopping IVF Photo shows Comedian Sashi Perera leans into her husband, both are smiling and posing beside a colourful wall on a street. Setting clear parameters to end IVF, with or without a baby, was a huge relief to me.\n\nThe shame and pain of IVF debt\n\nThe disenfranchised grief of childlessness coupled with shame around money means many childless people don't talk about their struggle with IVF debt, says Ms Roberts, who is based in Brisbane/Meanjin.\n\n\"There can be a lot of opinions and judgement that women receive around reproductive choices \u2014 like they left it too late, or they are desperate, or why did they spend so much money.\n\n\"The flip side is they can feel like they are judged for not trying enough.\"\n\nHas IVF debt been a part of your childlessness journey? We'd be honoured to hear from you lifestyle@abc.net.au\n\nDr Zigmont, who considers himself childfree, but not by choice, says being unable to meet society's expectations of becoming a parent can make people feel \"unworthy\".\n\n\"And where debt is seen as a negative in general, adding on 'failure' [to become a parent] can take a serious personal toll.\"\n\nHe says some childless people are not able to \"truly start\" the grieving process until that debt is gone.\n\n\"For clients with IVF debt, I often focus on paying that off first, even if it is not the highest-interest debt.\n\n\"Paying off IVF debt may be the first step towards healing.\"\n\nChildless not by choice Photo shows Michael takes a selfie standing next to his wife After 15 years of infertility treatment, Michael Hughes and his wife were left childless and grieving. But since then, they have found healing.\n\nIVF debt also 'missed opportunities'\n\nIn Australia, one IVF cycle costs on average of between $10,000 and $12,000.\n\nChildless people with debt for fertility treatment may have taken out a loan, borrowed money or used a payment plan through a clinic to fund it, Ms Roberts says.\n\nBut that isn't the only debt they are likely dealing with.\n\n\"There can also be debt around opportunities missed,\" she explains, for example someone not being able to purchase a home because they were funding treatment, or staying in a job they were unhappy in because of the parental leave entitlements.\n\n\"It may have really felt like their life was on hold.\"\n\nABC Lifestyle Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday.

(Pexels)\n\nThe \"standard life script\" for people is to go to school, get married, buy a house, work 25 years, retire, and pass on money to the next generation, Dr Zigmont says.\n\n\"It can be easier for childfree people who choose to leave the standard path by choice.\"\n\nBut for people who are childless not by choice, he says \"it can be much harder\", often involving a grieving process for the life they thought they were going to live, before they can envision a different one.\n\n\"Childfree [and childless] people need to create their own life plan, which can be both exhilarating and terrifying,\" says Dr Zigmont.\n\nAnd while people without kids often have more flexibility and freedom with money, he says it doesn't necessarily \"make you rich\".\n\n\"Income disparities still exist [and] childless people [may] start with a lower net worth due to IVF debt.\"\n\nFor support with childlessness: World Childless Week (for counsellors, therapists and support networks)\n\n(for counsellors, therapists and support networks) Lifeline on 13 11 14\n\non 13 11 14 Beyond Blue on 1300 224 636\n\non 1300 224 636 Red Nose Grief and Loss 24/7 Support Line on 1300 308 307\n\nGrief and Loss 24/7 Support Line on 1300 308 307 Bears of Hope (infant loss support for families) on 1300 114 673 We have included a range of helplines here knowing people have many different experiences of childlessness.\n\nMoving forward\n\nWhile IVF debt isn't necessarily a mistake, Dr Zigmont says it can feel that way.\n\nFor that reason, he says people need to give themselves grace and reach out for support.\n\n\"You don't have to do this alone. Join childless communities and you will find others going through the same struggles.\"\n\nThe World Childless Week website shares resources including support groups and specialist counsellors.\n\nMs Roberts says while coming to terms with childlessness can be \"incredibly heartbreaking\", it is doable.\n\n\" The whole process is a life that you didn't choose, but it's also potentially a really unique and beautiful life as well. \"\n\nShe says people should know it's OK to create space to spend time making sense of it all.\n\n\"One of the things that can happen for women financially, when they're coming to terms with childlessness, is realising they've carried a financial model in their minds that is a parenting financial model,\" she says, such as purchasing a home and building an asset base to \"pass onto children\".\n\n\"Coming to terms with childlessness means we can examine those aspects of our lives and question if that model still works for me now in my life.\"",

(ABC News: Sarah Gerathy)\n\nIn the boot is a mobile version of an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) machine, which is a form of heart and lung bypass that removes a patient's blood and replaces carbon dioxide with oxygen before pumping it back into their body.\n\n\"We use it in CPR when the heart has actually stopped to be able to protect the brain and effectively stop the clock so that we can fix the cause of the cardiac arrest,\" Dr Kruit said.\n\nOnce at the scene, where other paramedic teams will already be rendering CPR, the ECMO team gets to work using a portable ultrasound machine to guide them as they thread a catheter into the patient's groin and connect them to the ECMO system.\n\nThe dark blood turns bright red as it passes through the machine and back into the patient's body, delivering precious oxygen to their vital organs.\n\nThey are then taken to hospital, usually to have a blockage in their heart identified and cleared.\n\nTrials of the ECMO device are yielding results that are the best in the world. (ABC News: Sarah Gerathy)\n\nNSW Ambulance Commissioner Dominic Morgan said he was thrilled with the results of the trial so far.\n\n\"We are seeing already a 28 per cent survival rate for the numbers that have gone through the ECMO procedure,\" he said.\n\n\"And we are getting patients onto the heart lung bypass in world-beating times, as low as 17 minutes. Nowhere in the world are achieving what the doctors in New South Wales are achieving.\"\n\nDr Burns said the survival rate for the patients would normally be much lower, because they are in what is called \"refractory cardiac arrest\", and haven't responded to traditional CPR.\n\n\"If the patient doesn't come back after 15-20 minutes of resuscitation their chance of walking out of the hospital is less than 3 per cent,\" Dr Burns said.\n\n\"So we are seeing 10 times increased chance of survival. And we are interested in patient-centred outcomes, which is to walk out and go back to your family or go back to work.\"\n\nFirst patient to be saved by ECMO\n\nTodd Reuvers became the first person in Sydney to be saved by a mobile ECMO machine when he went into a cardiac arrest at the warehouse he was working at in south-western Sydney.\n\nTodd Reuvers went into cardiac arrest at a warehouse in south-western Sydney. (ABC News)\n\nHis colleagues came to his aid and rendered CPR before the first paramedics turned up, but his heart was still stopped for an hour.\n\n\"You don't realise how lucky I am,\" Mr Reuvers said.\n\n\" If it wasn't for the ECMO team and the government doing this study and this trial, I wouldn't be here. \"\n\nDr Kruit said the trial was also seeing a huge boost for patients who did not end up needing the ECMO machine, but who still benefit from the expertise and extra equipment that is brought to the scene of their cardiac arrest.\n\n\"We provide advanced monitoring and advanced therapies as well, so effectively what we are doing is bringing the hospital to the patient,\u201d she said.\n\nPaul Thompson benefited from the critical care and expertise provided by the ECMO team when he went into cardiac arrest in front of his wife Emma De Carle. (ABC News: Sarah Gerathy)\n\nPaul Thompson was headed to hospital with chest pains when he went into cardiac arrest in front of his partner Emma De Carle as she drove along Military Road at Cremorne in December.\n\n\"My last recollection was my field of vision just collapsing into a dark spot, it was like an old fashion TV just collapsing the black screen down to nothing,\" Mr Thompson said.\n\nHe was lucky that a lifesaver bystander gave him CPR and he didn't ultimately need to be placed on the heart and lung bypass.\n\nBut he was amazed to later learn of the help the critical care doctors from the ECMO team had given him when they arrived on scene.\n\n\"It's just a second chance at life,\" said Mr Thompson who has two teenage sons.\n\n\"I'm going to make the most of it with my family.\"\n\nImproving equity\n\nIn order to be eligible for the ECMO trial, patients need to be aged between 18 to 70, have had someone witness their cardiac arrest and have received CPR.\n\nA specially trained paramedic sitting in the emergency control centre assesses if patients meet the criteria to deploy the ECMO car.\n\nDr Kruit said that was a real game changer in parts of Sydney that were not close to major hospitals where they might usually be rushed to have a blockage cleared.\n\nDr Kruit, (left), says the device and the team provide critical support for patients that aren't near a hospital. (ABC News: Sarah Gerathy)\n\n\"Obviously the geography of Western Sydney and south-western Sydney in particular is very difficult to reach because it's so spread out.\n\n\"So bringing the technology to the patient we are actually improving the equity of access to all patients.\"\n\nNSW Health Minister Ryan Park said funding for the existing trial had been extended for another year.\n\nBut he was open to expanding it in the future.\n\n\"That's certainly something that we would look at doing should we continue to get these types of results,\" he said.",

(Supplied: Kath Tanner)\n\n\"She was amazing in terms of putting things into a context for me and making me understand what the process is; not only the process of getting prosthetics but also the process of your body healing.\"\n\nMs Tanner, who recently emceed a national amputee conference in Adelaide, said the mentor she met was a volunteer with the national amputee advocacy group Limbs 4 Life.\n\nThe organisation, which was established in 2004, has expanded in Tasmania, hosting a training session for prospective volunteers on June 21.\n\n\"It was in its infancy and I remember thinking 'Wow, I'm in this situation now and there will be a point where I'd love to share my experience and support others',\" Ms Tanner told ABC Tasmania Afternoons' Lucie Cutting.\n\nMs Tanner enjoys playing golf with other amputees throughout Australia. (Supplied: Kath Tanner)\n\nTasmanian amputees disadvantaged\n\nWhile there is no current data on amputations in the state, Tasmanian Amputee Society chief executive Peter Hatters said Tasmania had the highest rate of diabetes-related lower limb amputations in Australia.\n\nHe described Tasmanian amputees as the most disadvantaged in the country.\n\nThe majority, he said, were aged over 65 or living with minor lower limb difference such as diabetes-related toe or foot amputations, and as a result did not meet the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) eligibility criteria for funding to purchase prosthesis.\n\nWhile most amputees lived in the north and north-west of the state, the majority of surgical teams and other allied health services such as prosthetists, physiotherapists and occupational therapists were based in southern Tasmania, making services harder to access.\n\nThere were also fewer prosthetic providers in Tasmania, and those aged over 65 and without NDIS support could not access a provider of their choice.\n\nInstead, they were reliant on the Tasmanian Health Service and only able to obtain older prosthesis technology.\n\nThey may even be rejected for a prosthesis depending on their overall health, unless they could pay for it themselves, Mr Hatters said.\n\nMr Hatters believes Tasmanian amputees are the most disadvantaged in the country. (Supplied: Peter Hatters)\n\n\"Tasmanians living with limb difference are at a disadvantage and have limited choice and control over where they can access services,\" he said.\n\n\"Things have deteriorated since the 2021 Tasmanian Legislative Council inquiry into health services for amputees, including for both people receiving NDIS supports and others that do not receive NDIS funding.\n\n\" Those with NDIS supports struggle to get services, and those without are in an even worse position. \"\n\nMelissa Noonan, chief executive of Limbs 4 Life, is an above-knee amputee who was fitted with a mechanical and later micro-processor knee.\n\n\"I work full-time and the difference in being able to [work] with a good device is life changing,\" Ms Noonan said.\n\n\"When I was using the mechanical knee I would fall some times five times a week. It takes a lot of physical and mental effort to get through a week like that.\n\n\" Now I can walk on uneven terrain, grass, whatever. It changed my life. \"\n\nOne year ago, I became an amputee Photo shows James O'Brien smiles while standing in front of a sandy beach in Sydney. He's holding crutches and wearing his prosthetic leg. A year since my amputation, I'm marking my \"stumpiversary\" (as it's sometimes called in the amputee community) and I'm feeling both optimistic and reflective.\n\nAccording to Mr Hatters, diabetes is the leading cause of non-traumatic limb amputation in Tasmania.\n\n\"The incidence of amputations in Tasmania is increasing due to the diabetes epidemic. There are more than 4,400 amputations every year in Australia as a result of diabetes. This is the second highest rate in the developed world,\" he said.\n\n\"The number of amputations is placing stress on the Tasmanian Health System.\"\n\nOther causes of amputations include trauma, vascular complications and infections.\n\nAdvocating for a better future\n\nMs Tanner, now a Limbs 4 Life peer support volunteer and support group leader in Tasmania, said progress had been made since she became an amputee 15 years ago.\n\n\"There wasn't the support that is now available to amputees,\" she said.\n\n\"Community groups weren't at the forefront of you being able to find things out.\"\n\nMs Tanner speaking at an all-abilities golf event at Kingston Beach, Tasmania. (Supplied: Kath Tanner)\n\nMr Hatters also welcomed the expansion of Limbs 4 Life's peer support in Tasmania, but said sector-wide reform was needed.\n\n\"Peer support from another person who has experienced limb loss can be life changing for someone that has recently had an amputation or will undergo limb loss, as most of the time they can help the person in regards to the psychological worries they may have about everyday life,\" he said.\n\n\"This would be the number one support most people need.\"\n\nHowever, he said allied health services should also be equitable and easier to access.\n\n\"We would like to have the market open to other private [prosthesis] providers to allow freedom of choice for all Tasmanians living with limb difference, especially those over 65 that do not meet the NDIS criteria and others that do not meet the NDIS guidelines,\" he said.",

        "text": "The Australian dollar has dropped below 60 US cents for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, with it also having its biggest daily fall in 17 years.\n\nThe local currency is dropping in the wake of US President Donald Trump's tariffs announcement, as they stoke fears of a global recession and investors sell off trillions of dollars' worth of stocks.\n\n\"Certainly, if the Aussie dollar falls very steeply, it's because something bad is happening somewhere,\" currency analyst Sean Callow from firm ITC Markets told ABC News.\n\nThe lower dollar will give Australians less purchasing power overseas, including when they travel.\n\nOn the flip side, the situation is good news for Australian exporters, who may find more demand for goods as the lower dollar makes our exports cheaper overseas.\n\nWhy is the AUD dropping?\n\nThe AUD has been dropping against the greenback all year, with it hovering around 63 to 64 US cents for the last few months.\n\nYet last week, when Trump upended the global economic order with widespread tariffs, the AUD held up against the US currency, which actually took a major hit itself.\n\nMr Carrow thinks this initially buffered the Australian currency from falls.\n\n\"The puzzle initially was how the Aussie dollar held up pretty well after the tariffs were announced,\" analyst Sean Carrow notes.\n\nYet the AUD eventually started significantly dropping on Friday, with ANZ analysts noting that it actually had its worst single-daily fall in 17 years, since the global financial crisis (GFC).\n\n\"The AUD/USD saw its largest intraday fall since 2008 on tariff related global growth fears,\" the bank's note said this morning.\n\n\"The AUD is highly attuned to changes in risk sentiment in global markets,\" ANZ's analyst Felix Ryan told ABC News this morning.\n\n\"This means that during times of souring risk sentiment or concerns over the global growth outlook (as we are seeing now with US tariffs), we typically see the AUD weaken.\n\n\" This underperformance of the AUD is not just confined to against the USD, but also against the other G-10 currencies such as the Euro, Japanese Yen and Pound Sterling. \"\n\nMr Carrow said the AUD started dropping as news broke that China was retaliating against the US tariffs. China is Australia's biggest trading partner and our top market for exports like iron ore.\n\nChina's share market was closed on Friday for holidays, and Mr Carrow says it is possible that investors took out their rage on the Australian dollar instead.\n\n\"The Aussie dollar is a proxy for Asian growth,\" Mr Carrow notes.\n\nThe losses held up over the weekend. At 10:30am AEST, the Australian dollar was worth 59.85 US cents, but had traded as low as 59.33 US cents shortly after 8am, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nThe last time the Aussie dollar traded below 60 US cents was for a few days in March 2020 and one day in April 2020. Before that, it traded close to 60 US cents during the height of the global financial crisis.\n\nThe Australian dollar last consistently traded below 60 US cents in a period between mid-2000 and early 2003, when it hit lows below 50 US cents.\n\n\"The start of the week looks as though it's going to be very difficult,\" Mr Carrow says.\n\n\" It is certainly very weak against the US dollar, and also just very weak against the Europeans. So it's a terrible time to go for holiday in Europe. \"\n\n\"It does look as though the Aussie is going to be spending more time below 60 cents. But it has fallen a very long way, and as we saw last week, things can change very quickly.\n\n\"So it may not take that much of a glimmer of optimism, whatever it may be, to at least produce a bit more stability in the Australian dollar.\"",

(AP Photo: Annie Rice)\n\nHe has said previously that vaccination was a personal choice and advocated for the use of vitamin A, which has been shown in some studies in developing countries to lessen the severity of symptoms but which can lead to liver toxicity in high quantities.\n\nRepublican US senator Bill Cassidy, who is also a physician and who backed Mr Kennedy's confirmation after he promised not to make changes to vaccine oversight, said on X after the reported death that \"everyone should be vaccinated\".\n\n\"Top health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies,\" Mr Cassidy wrote on X.\n\nThe measles vaccine is 97 per cent effective after two shots.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on its website says the vaccine is \"the best protection against measles\", which spreads through the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs.\n\nLocal media have reported that Mr Kennedy plans to attend the child's funeral scheduled for Sunday.\n\n'An absolute needless death'\n\nPeter Marks, the Food and Drug Administration's former vaccine chief, said responsibility for the death rests with Mr Kennedy and his staff.\n\nDr Marks was forced out of the FDA after disagreements with Mr Kennedy over vaccine safety.\n\n\"This is the epitome of an absolute needless death,\" he told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday.\n\n\" These kids should get vaccinated \u2014 that's how you prevent people from dying of measles. \"\n\nDr Marks also said he recently warned US senators that more deaths would occur if the administration didn't mount a more aggressive response to the outbreak.\n\nThe first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months in the US. (AP Photo: Mary Conlon, File)\n\nExperts and local health officials expect the outbreak to go on for several more months if not a year.\n\nIn West Texas, the vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated people and children younger than 17.\n\nWith several states facing outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable disease \u2014 and declining childhood vaccination rates nationwide \u2014 some worry that measles may cost the US its status as having eliminated the disease.\n\nMeasles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours.\n\nUp to nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC.\n\nReuters/AP",

(AAP Image/Theron Kirkman)\n\nThe WA Athletics Stadium uses a pre-fabricated surface by Italian company, Mondo. It's one of just a handful of Mondo tracks in the country.\n\nMost tracks in Australia use a company called Polytan, which lays tracks on site, and has a factory in Melbourne.\n\nPre-fabricated tracks are where the layers of the track are put together off-site, then put into place, while an 'in-situ' installation requires each layer being laid separately at the venue.\n\n\"It's very unusual in our Australian market, outside WA (to use a pre-fabricated surface). I think there's only two tracks that are Mondo on the east coast,\" Hill said.\n\n\"WA has historically stuck with Mondo.\"\n\nWhy is Mondo considered 'fast'?\n\nThe Italian company has carved a reputation as being the track that results in the fastest times, something Hill said is part engineering, and part marketing.\n\n\"If you talk to the athletes, the short-distance athletes often prefer the Mondo,\" he said.\n\nJarrod Hill is an expert in sport and recreation facilities. (Supplied: SportENG)\n\n\"They feel it does give them a better, maybe a little harder surface underfoot, because of the manufacturing there and that in turn gives them a quicker time.\n\n\"We're talking small percentages.\n\n\" You and I, running on it, probably wouldn't notice the difference. \"\n\nHe also said the partnership between World Athletics and Mondo has helped cement the surface's reputation.\n\nEver since the 1976 Montreal Olympics, Mondo has supplied the running track. It has also built the tracks at virtually every Commonwealth Games.\n\n\"Every time a world record, an Olympic record, is held, the world hears about it because it's on that stage and it's on a Mondo product,\" Hill said.\n\nMondo has provided the track for every Olympics since Montreal in 1976, including the Paris Games in 2024. (AAP Image/Dan Himbrechts)\n\n\"I think that level of competition is afraid to move away from Mondo as well. Because if you step away and they're slower times, well, then they'll be known as the slow Olympics.\n\n\"There's not a lot of literature that probably supports that, because there are world cup records also run on non-Mondo tracks as well.\"\n\nWhy is Mondo rare in Australia?\n\nSportENG has advised on numerous venues across Australia, including the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games venue. It also advised on the redevelopment of Ern Clarke Athletics Centre in Perth, which hosted the World Masters Games in 2016.\n\nTypically, there are three tiers of track surface to consider when building an athletics stadium.\n\nPre-fabricated and fully polyurethane 'in-situ' systems sit at the top and are used on elite venues.\n\nSportENG advised on the construction of the track for the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games at Carrara. (AAP Image/Dean Lewins)\n\nBelow them is a \"sandwich system\", which is often found at local athletics tracks. That uses a cheaper rubber on the bottom, and a polyurethane top layer.\n\nBottom of the list is a structural spray, which can be found in many schools.\n\nThe premium paid for a Mondo track as compared to a polyurethane track laid in-situ is high.\n\n'He's quite angry': Gout Gout's coach speaks out on his loss Photo shows Gout Gout crouches after 200m at Maurie Plant Meet. Gout Gout has begun to transcend the sport of athletics in Australia, but his surprising loss at the weekend served as a reminder that he's still a teenager and ultimately success is never guaranteed.\n\nThe pre-fabricated system, made in Italy and then shipped to the location, can cost up to $60-per-square more.\n\nThat adds considerable cost to a venue featuring a 10-lane, 420 metre track, including the extra length on the front-straight.\n\nBut while cost is a consideration, so is the climate in which the track will exist.\n\nHill said an example of that is at the Arafura Stadium in the Northern Territory.\n\n\"Because of the high rainfall and higher humidity we have, they've had issues with the full polyurethane system, because water would readily get trapped underneath there and result in bubbles,\" he said.\n\n\"We had to go to the sandwich system, which has a base layer of black rubber, which is a bit more permeable, and if any moisture gets trapped in there, it can move horizontally to the drainage system.\"\n\nThe replacement cost of Mondo is something also considered. The tracks typically have a life of 10-years before needing to be replaced, and it's not a cheap endeavour.\n\nWill Gout Gout run faster in Perth?\n\nGout has spent most of his career running on a Polytan track in Brisbane. That's the surface he ran his sub-20 second 200 metres on.\n\nHill said simply competing on a Mondo track isn't a guarantee of faster times.\n\nThere is hope Gout will run another blistering time in Perth. (AAP Image/Jono Searle)\n\n\"Often you sort of see when you go from one surface, train all your time on it and then come on to another one, where that impacts them, versus a local that might have trained always on a Mondo,\" Hill said.\n\n\"It'll be interesting to see if there's any change to his times.\"\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

        "text": "Sarah Williams wasn't looking for a career change. She didn't dream of quitting her job in the higher education sector to launch a short-stay accommodation business near Tasmania's pristine Wilderness World Heritage Area \u2014 though if you don't know her full story, it might sound like a dream.\n\nWhen she resigned from her job as an intranet designer at Melbourne University in 2017, Williams was at breaking point. Since being diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) in 2009, when she was 33, she'd struggled to keep her head above water at work, fighting debilitating fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, frequent viral infections and, in a previous role at a different university, a graceless manager who refused her request to work some days from home because it would be \"unfair\" to her team.\n\nBut when she crashed that year, her health and life in freefall, she was too exhausted to feel sad. \"I felt so utterly sick and depleted that I knew I needed time off to rest completely,\" says Williams, now 49. The only way she could afford to do that, though, was by moving back to a property she owned in Meander, an hour's drive south-west of Launceston in Tasmania, where she grew up.\n\nA handsome cedar shingled guesthouse her grandfather had built next door would one day become the bones of her new career \u2014 her meal ticket. But for a long while Williams pushed thoughts of work, of getting out of bed, to the back of her mind. \"My 69-year-old mother who lived in Adelaide flew down to be my unpaid carer for what we thought might be three to six months,\" she says. \"It turned into eight years.\"\n\nSarah Williams's grandfather in 1986 built the guesthouse that would become Cedar Cottage Meander decades later. (Supplied: Natasha Mulhall)\n\nChronic illness can derail careers\n\nWhen it comes to career changes, our cultural conversations often follow the unicorns among us \u2014 high-profile movers and shakers who take impressive leaps of faith at brave new endeavours: the formula one engineer who cooked up a popular croissanterie, the Hollywood actress who built a cult lifestyle and wellness brand. But what about the people who change their career not to scratch some creative or philanthropic itch or make a truckload of money, but out of necessity \u2014 because illness or injury derailed or destroyed their ability to work?\n\nThe most recent Jobs Mobility report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows 2.1 million people left or lost a job in the year to February 2024, with about a quarter saying they did so to get a better job, or because they just wanted a change. But nearly 6 per cent lost a job because of their own ill-health or injury, up from about 4 per cent in 2021 \u2014 more than the 4.6 per cent who retired, or the 1 per cent who left a job to start their own business.\n\nAn aerial photo of Sarah Williams's property in Meander, Tasmania. (Supplied: Krista Eppelstun)\n\nAs Williams knows well, ME/CFS \u2014 which can be triggered by viral infection, trauma or chemical or mould exposure (Williams developed it after getting glandular fever, an infection caused by the Epstein Barr virus) \u2014 can seriously limit patients' ability to work.\n\nA 2019 survey of more than 1,000 Australians with ME/CFS found 89 per cent had stopped working or significantly reduced their hours of paid work, with just half reporting they were engaged in some form of employment, education or training. The survey, by advocacy organisation Emerge Australia, found more than two-thirds of patients were living below the poverty line, with the majority spending substantial amounts of money on medical appointments, medication and supplements.\n\nSimilar patterns are now playing out among people with long COVID, another infection associated chronic illness whose signs and symptoms overlap with ME/CFS. Australian researchers have estimated long COVID resulted in an average of 100 million lost labour hours in 2022, costing the economy $9.6 billion, or one-quarter of Australia's real GDP growth that year.\n\nTurning a corner\n\nFor years after Williams moved back to Tasmania, her health continued to decline. Mostly confined to her bed, she had trouble thinking clearly and reading, became painfully sensitive to light and noise and was almost entirely dependent on her mother. But by 2020 she'd turned a corner \u2014 likely the result, she says, of lower stress and proper rest, taking antivirals, treating her thyroid disease, and getting on hormonal contraceptives, which stopped her periods and the symptom flares they sparked.\n\nShe also credits the awe-striking natural environment around her: the Meander Valley's lush rainforests, woodlands and moorlands, hundreds of wild caves, stunning gorges, serene lakes and gushing waterfalls. \"I like that it's a mix of rural and bush and the wildness is lovely,\" Williams says. \"Seeing native birds and animals\" \u2014 pademelons, possums, eagles, robins, wrens, lizards and frogs \u2014 \"just the fact you can see life going along, doing its thing, is sublimely beautiful.\"\n\nSarah Williams loves watching the native animals and birds that visit her property. (Supplied: Natasha Mulhall)\n\nAnd then it hit her: If she loved where she lived, other people would, too. But would they pay to stay \u2014 could she earn a living in the process? The guesthouse Williams's grandfather had constructed in 1986 from local Myrtle heartwood and Huon pine was \"quirky\" and \"gorgeous\", she says, but needed renovating. She used her savings to modernise it, building a deck and installing a cedar hot tub with sweeping views across the valley and mountains.\n\nOn top of developing a \"sustainable\" business model and marketing strategy, researching her competition and deciding which booking technology to use, Williams also had to work out how she'd run her short-stay accommodation business with an energy limiting illness. She was better, but not well, so help \u2014 with gardening, maintenance, linens, laundry \u2014 would need to be outsourced.\n\nThe stunning view across the valley from Williams's guesthouse. (Supplied: Natasha Mulhall)\n\nWhen she launched Cedar Cottage Meander in January 2021 \u2014 just as the COVID pandemic was picking up steam \u2014 travel, for many Australians, was on the backburner. It was a calculated risk. \"I was looking forward to the first guests, feeling a little bit overwhelmed, but excited as well,\" Williams says. \"And I didn't really have any expectations for it \u2014 I just wanted to see where it would go.\"\n\n'Disability can affect anyone'\n\nThat's not to say any of it was easy. Williams is acutely aware of how fortunate she is to be able to work at all, that she had property \u2014 and the loving support of her family \u2014 to fall back on. And her decision to start her own business in the first place was perversely influenced by her aversion to applying for disability support. She'd heard stories about how difficult, often impossible, it was for people with ME/CFS to access such programs and, given the lack of awareness and education among doctors, had little faith it would be a straightforward process.\n\nCase in point: just 3 per cent of ME/CFS patients surveyed by Emerge Australia in 2019 said they were able to access the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) \u2014 a troubling figure, the non-profit said, given how physically and cognitively disabling ME/CFS can be.\n\n\"I've learned that injury, illness and disability can affect anyone at any age, and there is no moral component,\" Williams says. (Supplied: Jess Bonde)\n\n\"The idea of navigating either the Disability Support Pension or later the NDIS felt overwhelmingly daunting,\" Williams says. \"I wanted to have control over my livelihood and I knew the stress of applying for either would be counterproductive to my health. I didn't trust that the service model would provide the support I needed without taxing my energy reserves to the point of another relapse.\"\n\nToday, an average work week involves managing bookings and communicating with guests, scheduling maintenance visits, planning content for her website and social media, \"endless\" laundry and cleaning and making sure her mum \u2014 who still lives with her \u2014 has everything she needs to look after the cottage's organic vegetable garden. Thrillingly, though, Williams says her business allows her to fully support herself financially, including paying for disability support workers when she needs them: \"I kind of have to pinch myself because it's done really well \u2026 I'm proud of the fact it's been successful commercially.\"\n\nSarah's mother Carol Williams, who tends to an organic veggie garden on the property called \"Veg Mahal\". (Supplied: Natasha Mulhall)\n\nAnd while sometimes she misses aspects of her old career \u2014 she spent 14 years in the higher education sector, relishing the creativity and teamwork of her IT roles \u2014 she has grown to appreciate the lessons her chronic illness has foisted on her, the way it has reshaped her outlook on work into something gentler, more accepting of her limitations.\n\nHer eyes are also now open to the fragility of life, and the unnerving possibility that we all may be just an infection or accident away from losing our ability to get up tomorrow, to go to work, to live fully.\n\n\"I've learned that injury, illness and disability can affect anyone at any age, and there is no moral component,\" Williams says. \"I've learned that productivity doesn't equate to self-worth. That a lot of 'busyness' is a waste of time, and that doing nothing is valuable, too \u2026 I've learned that sometimes we can create the type of employment we want to see in the world, instead of looking to others to provide it.\"",

An estimated 4.9 million Australians battle through the debilitating pain of migraines. But despite estimates the condition costs the national economy billions each year, a leading researcher says there's far from enough funding or support.\n\nAfter a series of tests \u2014 which ruled out family history of brain tumour \u2014 Ms Awburn was eventually diagnosed with chronic persistent daily headaches, a form of chronic migraine.\n\nLike many people who live with migraine, exercise often brings on an attack for Ms Awburn, some 15-years after she first experienced it.\n\n\"Exercising is really hard, especially when I was in my early 20s, I was having up to 25 attacks a month, and I was basically bed bound, like couldn't really do anything,\" Ms Awburn said.\n\n\"Some days I could go for a nice walk and be fine afterwards or I could be bed bound for the next two or three days, you just never really know.\n\n\" If you've got a busy schedule, you run your business like it does make it hard to toe the line, and it's such a double-edged sword, because you don't want to overdo it, which is really hard. \"\n\nExercise a 'double-edged sword' for people living with migraine\n\nStudies show exercise can be prescribed as a non-medical treatment that could decrease attack frequency, intensity and duration. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\nFor many people who live with migraine \u2014 like Ms Awburn \u2014 exercise has been reported as a trigger for attacks, despite limited research to back up the reports.\n\nOne study by the Journal of Headache and Pain found 38 per cent of participants reported exercise as a trigger for attacks.\n\n56 per cent of those participants reported the attack began during exercise, while others reported an attack started on average more than two hours after exercise had stopped.\n\nBut on the other hand, studies also show that exercise can be prescribed as a non-medical treatment that could decrease pain frequency and might improve intensity and attack duration.\n\nMigraine often undiagnosed and untreated Photo shows A selfie of a young Asian woman near the water. She is looking directly into the camera. Natalie suffered with chronic migraine attacks for 17 years, then one injection changed everything. Experts say she is one of the \"lucky ones\".\n\nAccredited exercise physiologist Emily Cordes \u2014 who also lives with chronic migraine \u2014 has first-hand experience.\n\n\"For the first year or so of living with chronic migraine, I, personally, couldn't really exercise without triggering an attack, and I would find all sorts of different things would trigger attacks,\" Ms Cordes said.\n\n\"It just felt like, yeah, it was a bit of a nightmare, to be honest.\"\n\nNow, Ms Cordes works with a \"huge number\" of people who live with migraine, and she said it's a complicated relationship.\n\n\"Even if you feel like exercise is a trigger for your migraine attacks, it might not be the whole story,\" Ms Cordes said.\n\n\"It could be that they're exercising in the sunshine and the heat is bringing one on, or they're dehydrated when they're working out, or perhaps they haven't eaten recently, and their glucose levels drop as they're exercising.\n\n\" I mean exercise also can just improve people's sleep, which can help with migraine, improve their mental health, their stress levels. \"\n\nTrial and error\n\nAccredited exercise physiologist Emily Cordes also lives with chronic migraine. (ABC News: Shauna Foley )\n\nWhile medical research into migraine has improved recently, it is still limited and the way each person experiences an attack can vary greatly.\n\nIn her personal experience, Ms Cordes said exercising can sometimes abort an attack but it's best to trial what works for each individual.\n\n\"When I'm working with a client who has migraine, I tend to say, if your pain is around that level five out of 10, you might want to try going for a walk and just experiment,\" she said.\n\nHow stigma and a lack of knowledge is limiting migraine treatment in Australia Photo shows Dark haired woman holds her head in her hands Experts say there are many reasons why medical practitioners struggle to treat migraine but there are ways to address it.\n\n\"If the pain is already beyond a five out of 10, you're better off resting and doing it on a day where you don't have any of your migraine symptoms present.\n\n\"Don't rush this \u2026 exercise should also be fun, so, trying to find ways that you can do things that are enjoyable to you, and starting small and building slowly.\"\n\nAs for Ms Awburn, she can already see a difference since working with an exercise physiologist in Canberra last year.\n\n\"Touch wood, but I think I haven't had as many attacks since starting this program with Haley [exercise physiologist], so I definitely am noticing more strength in my upper back and neck,\" Ms Awburn said.",

(ABC News)\n\nWith winter approaching and the extra hospital capacity in the southern suburbs still a while away, it appears the pressure on doctors at the FMC won't be abating any time soon.\n\n\"It's not just the opposition who has concerns about what's going on in our health system,\" shadow health spokesperson Ashton Hurn said on Friday.\n\n\"The peak doctors' union are saying that they too are worried about what the health system is going to be like in winter.\n\n\"It doesn't matter who you speak to or which data you look at, our health system is on its knees here in South Australia.\"",

Credit: Charlotte Grieve\n\nIt was Doves versus Redbacks, and a loyal Doves supporter \u2013 Hill dodged a photo with the winning team, the Redbacks from Hampton Park, which just happens to be outside of his electorate. \u201cI\u2019m Doveton all the way!\u201d\n\nAlso in tow was Casey mayor Stefan Koomen, who was in a precarious position as his council area spans both teams. \u201cI\u2019m considering getting a scarf of both teams knitted together,\u201d he said, smiling but serious.\n\nHill spoke with locals about AFL history, and caught up with Doveton Soccer Club president Daniel McMinimee \u2013 whose club benefited recently from around $200,000 in federal funding to upgrade facilities.\n\n\u201cFirst time we\u2019ve had lights on our ground since it\u2019s been built,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of Julian\u2019s.\u201d\n\nHill with Dusty the puppy Ridgeback. Credit: Charlotte Grieve\n\nHill says political comments don\u2019t go down well on weekends, but he makes one \u201cevidence-based\u201d exception: \u201cBasically for 10 years, the whole city of greater Dandenong got literally nothing from the feds, literally nothing, because every grants program was pork-barrelled and rorted.\u201d\n\nHill points to $7.5 million given to Doveton pool by the current government, which was allocated after he encouraged the community to make a grant application with a business case. \u201cI haven\u2019t delivered everything the community wants, but I can say we\u2019ve delivered programs, everything according to need.\u201d\n\nAfter a quick pat with Dusty the puppy Ridgeback, and pop into the changerooms for a photo with the Doveton players, he\u2019s back on the road.\n\nBruce voter Bahanita Danish plans to vote for the Liberal candidate Zahid Safi. Credit: Charlotte Grieve\n\nNext stop is a 10-minute drive away.\n\nThe stubbie-holders and sausages are replaced with charcoaled meats and hennaed hands at the Narwoz festival, also known as the Afghan new year, held in a Hallam park.\n\nHill was asked to make a speech at the last minute so took a seat and started tapping away at his phone. Politicians of all persuasions sat in the front row, including Victorian Liberal MP Ann-Marie Hermans, state Labor MP Lee Tarlamis and Greens candidate for Bruce, Rhonda Garad.\n\n\u201cIt must be election year, with all the politicians here,\u201d the MC told the crowd.\n\nIn his speech, Hill said Narwoz was an ancient celebration and time for renewal.\n\n\u201cNarwoz Mubarak everyone!\u201d he said. \u201cEid Mubarak to our Muslim brothers and sisters!\u201d\n\nHill praised Australia\u2019s democracy and said the upcoming federal election was a reminder of \u201chow lucky we are to live in a democracy where we do have the great privilege to vote and choose our governments\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe majority of people in the world do not,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI get asked this in my role \u2013 what\u2019s an Australian? An Australian, to me, is anyone committed to our country and to the principle of mutual respect for their fellow Australians.\n\n\u201cWhen you come to this country, no one expects you to leave your culture at the door. Quite the opposite. Australia encourages people to celebrate their culture, to cherish the traditions and pass them onto their kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we can celebrate our freedom, spare a thought for the people in Afghanistan right now where Narwoz is banned. And the women and girls who are not even allowed to show their faces or be seen in society.\u201d\n\nBruce is home to Victoria\u2019s largest Afghan community, and will be an influential voter base this election.\n\nAfghan-born Liberal candidate Zahid Safi could not be seen at the event. Victorian Liberal Opposition Leader Brad Battin was the party\u2019s representative on the speaker list.\n\n\u201cJulian, we keep meeting at events. It\u2019s good to see you here again. It\u2019s great to be out with you,\u201d Battin told the crowd, before praising the event and community.\n\n\u201cWe get to have events like this, where people from all colours of our persuasion in our democracy come here together.\u201d\n\nSitting next to me in the crowd was Pashto-teacher Bahanita Danish. She said Safi might be nervous to attend after being heckled earlier in the week at the Doveton mosque. Danish will be voting for Safi this election, she said, after he visited her school in recent months.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very kind,\u201d she said. \u201cI think change is coming.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the crowd, a young man named Ahmed Ahmedi said \u201cfor now\u201d he will vote Labor over what he said was a better record on immigration. \u201cBecause it\u2019s good for people from overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cGood for immigration.\u201d\n\nBut he said he had to learn more, as there was a bad \u201ccourt decision\u201d that he heard about, but could not elaborate further.\n\nLabor\u2019s response to the High Court ruling that found indefinite detention was illegal, including fewer rights for detainees and tougher deportation laws, has been criticised by human rights groups as draconian.\n\nSaturday on the hustings wouldn\u2019t be complete without a baby\u2019s head being kissed. Hill was chatting to a young mother on the sidelines of the cultural event, who excitedly passed her baby to the politician for a cuddle.\n\n\u201cI love babies,\u201d he said, to smiles all around. \u201cShe\u2019s so cute.\u201d",

        "text": "The 0-4 Blues have gutted their depth. Gone to other clubs in the past three seasons are Will Setterfield, Liam Stocker, Paddy Dow, Jack Carroll, Matthew Kennedy, Jack Martin and Matthew Owies. David Cuningham and Caleb Marchbank, injury-prone but highly talented, have also left. Loading There were sound reasons for all those changes, which allowed Blues list boss Nick Austin to take more picks in the draft, headlined by the audacious move last year to acquire Jagga Smith. Smith\u2019s pre-season knee injury means his acquisition is now viewed through the prism of the heavy price paid rather than anything he does on the field. Except for Kennedy, a well-respected clubman and top-10 in their best and fairest last year, none have made the Blues pay, but it means Voss must now turn to kids and debutants. As reported by this masthead, Harry McKay and Elijah Hollands are no certainties to return to the senior team despite a return to competitive football on the weekend after time out for personal reasons.\n\nCorey Durdin, Jordan Boyd and the uncapped Matt Carroll will come under strong consideration. Ben and Lucas Camporeale are tracking for opportunities later in the year. The rest are still finding their way at the lower level. Can Danger get to 400? Friday night, GMHBA Stadium\n\nGeelong defeated Melbourne by 39 points Patrick Dangerfield looked powerful on Friday night. Could he make it to 400 games? Credit: Getty Images Patrick Dangerfield turned 35 on the weekend. Most players have retired by that age. If they haven\u2019t, they are well and truly slowing down. Not so Dangerfield.\n\nInjuries have not dulled Dangerfield\u2019s explosiveness. The 2016 Brownlow medallist still has the speed and power that have made him one of the best players of the 21st century, and the preparedness to use it despite his vulnerability to soft-tissue injuries. \u201cWhen you look at older players, the ones that haven\u2019t lost their speed and power you think they can play forever,\u201d Geelong coach Chris Scott said. \u201cPat certainly hasn\u2019t lost any of that.\u201d Which begs the question, how much longer can Dangerfield play for? And can he join the 400 club? If Dangerfield, contracted until the end of 2026, can play 20 games this year and next for the perennial finalists, it will take him to 377 and within reach of 400 in 2027.\n\nYou\u2019d think injuries, and not form, will be the critical factor for Dangerfield, who has not played a full season since 2020. The Cats will be keeping a close eye on Dangerfield\u2019s workload. Back-to-back six-day breaks heading into rounds seven and eight present a logical time for him to be rested. Playing forward will help Dangerfield\u2019s longevity, giving him the breaks between contests that he is not afforded when he plays on the ball. His coach wants him forward. He can envisage Dangerfield having a similar impact near goal as Leigh Matthews, viewed by many as the greatest of all time, who played out his career from the goal square.\n\nLoading With goalkicking great Tom Hawkins retired and young forward Shannon Neale finding his way, the Cats have a need for Dangerfield inside 50, though he remains their best midfielder as well. \u201cThe more we can be kicking the ball to him, rather than him kicking it in there, we think it\u2019s going to be better for us,\u201d Cats coach Chris Scott said. \u201cI think he thinks that he can be a forward for many years to come, I think he\u2019s looking forward to that challenge. \u201cThe best player of all-time [Matthews] did it, he went forward ... they\u2019re a bit similar.\u201d\n\nThe connection between Swans recruit and Luke Parker Saturday night, Marvel Stadium\n\nSydney defeated North Melbourne by 65 points Sydney wanted more than the bag of chips North Melbourne were offering for Luke Parker last year because they felt he was worth more than a pick in the 60s. Former teammates Luke Parker and Braeden Campbell embrace post game. Credit: AFL Photos Discussions between the clubs slowed after initial talks, but eventually a deal was settled on deadline day for pick 44 to head to Sydney in exchange for Parker and Jacob Konstanty.\n\nLoading That pick, eventually No.41, was used to secure mature-age recruit and childhood Swans supporter Riley Bice, who was already impressing figures at Sydney before his 26-possession game against the Kangaroos. Bice has also taken Parker\u2019s No.26 jumper. After three games, Bice is shaping as another astute, bargain-basement buy for the Swans, who turned a veteran, albeit a favourite son, who was no longer central to their plans into a younger, ready-made player. It\u2019s also a win for Parker, who was due to come out of contract this year with Sydney but was given an extension to 2026 by North.\n\nThe loss that did not feel like one Saturday twilight, MCG\n\nBrisbane defeated Richmond by 28 points England\u2019s cricketers put the term \u201cmoral victory\u201d into the sporting lexicon during the 2023 Ashes. Not even the most rabid of Richmond supporters would be so silly as to say they were moral victors over Brisbane, but this was one of those rare games where a loss would not have felt like one for the fans. The young Tigers played with obvious spirit against the reigning premiers. Credit: via Getty Images Their No.1 draft pick (Sam Lalor) had 24 possessions and two goals. And another first-round pick Luke Trainor showed promise again in defence. Seth Campbell is building a handy second season. Senior players Jacob Hopper and Tim Taranto are up for the fight.",

With this decision, they are not only seeking to forbid Marine from becoming a candidate. They want to deprive you of your voice and of your freedom of choice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe court found that Ms Le Pen used EU funds, meant for parliamentary assistants, to pay party staff in France.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe received a four-year sentence, including two years in prison and two suspended.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s appealing the verdict, but the sentence took effect immediately, something she and her party see as politically motivated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is not a court decision, it's a political decision. So now I should be eliminated from political life without any possible recourse, in the name of a so-called disturbance of democratic public order - a concept purely and simply invented for the occasion. Excuse me, but the main, and even the only disturbance of democratic public order, is that which consists of preventing the sole sovereign, the people, from expressing themselves. This is why I affirm that this political decision has not only flouted the rule of law, but also the state of democracy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross town in Saint-Denis [[san-denee]], former Prime Minister Gabriel Attal pushed back.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe leads the centre-right Renaissance Party and says the verdict was fair, and based on facts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, the facts are clear. Marine Le Pen and the National Rally were found guilty after 10 years of investigation and process of having embezzled millions of euros from our taxes.\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Attal criticised Ms Le Pen\u2019s comparisons to figures like Alexei Navalny and Martin Luther King, calling the comparisons, dishonest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Madam Le Pen. You aren't (late Russian opposition leader) Alexei Navalny. You are one of the pawns of his executioner. You have neither his courage nor his ideals. We, the resistance to this oppression, we know what it looks like. It does not have the face of Marine Le Pen .\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, left-wing protesters also gathered in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome carried signs that read \u201cNo Trumpism in France\u201d and \u201cEmergency Revolution.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporters of the Unbowed party, like Brahim Saidi, say the conviction shows the system is finally holding Ms Le Pen accountable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSorry, but she embezzled money. Money from all the French people. She must own what she did.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEven among Ms Le Pen\u2019s supporters, some weren\u2019t questioning the trial itself, but the timing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlexadre Dufosset is a member of Parliament and National Rally party member.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs you know, Marine Le Pen was sentenced last week. What we find unjust isn\u2019t the trial itself. It\u2019s the fact that the sentence takes effect immediately despite the fact that she has appealled, as she has the right to. That appeal restores the presumption of innocence and so it should be respected. The fact that the sentence is being applied immediately will prevent her from taking part in the next presidential election. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re here to show our support for Marine Le Pen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPolls suggest that Ms Le Pen and National Rally still have strong support, and Mr Bardella is already being seen as a possible 2027 candidate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the outcome of Ms Le Pen\u2019s appeal, expected in mid-2026, could still shift the political landscape.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor now, France is split.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne side sees justice being done.\n\n\n\n",

But they're doing that because they understand that they bear a lot of the tariff.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has backflipped on its plan to change current flexible working arrangements, including work from home policies in the public service.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat decision coincides with new Labor modelling, which has found that women forced back into job sharing under the proposal would leave families hundreds of dollars a week worse off in their pay-packets.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has estimated that the families of women who will need to reduce their hours to the equivalent of three days a week will sustain a gross loss of $740 per week, amounting to $38,000 annually.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe opposition spokesperson for finance, Jane Hume, now says she understands \"flexible work, including working from home, is part of getting the best out of any workforce.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister for Women and the Public Service Katy Gallagher has been critical of the proposal, saying \"women have embraced flexible full-time work\" and such a reversal will be \"bad for the economy, bad for families, and bad for the services that Australians rely on\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 2.6 million women regularly work from home, with 750-thousand more working from home on a regular basis compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberal party has dumped its candidate for the New South Wales seat of Whitlam, Benjamin Britton, after it emerged he believes women should not be allowed to serve in army combat corps.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton previously praised Mr Britton as an \"outstanding candidate\" but he has now been replaced by Nathaniel Smith, CEO of Master Plumbers Association of New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a podcast episode with rightwing figure Joel Jammal last year, Mr Britton said he had served with \"tremendous\" women in the army, but maintained they were unsuited to infantry roles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The concept of diversity and equity, and these woke Marxist ideologies, young women are been put on the altar and sacrificed for this for this ideology.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nA coalition of community groups have gathered in Sydney to condemn anti-Arab racism and Islamophobia in Australia, that have surged since the 7th of October attacks in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nProtest organisers have called on authorities to do more to ensure public safety, with many in the Arab diaspora and Muslim community saying they live in fear.\n\n\n\n\n\nMariam Tohamy's personal experience of Islamophobia gained national attention, after she filmed a woman abusing her in Kmart last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the footage, a woman can be seen verbally attacking Ms Tohamy, while making a throat-slitting gesture toward her and her child.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says she is among other Muslim women who are fearful of going about their daily lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Due to their visibility, Muslim women have borne the brunt of these horrible, racist attacks. Three out of four attacks have targeted Muslim women. Some women have expressed so much fear that they cannot go to their local grocery store without being accompanied by somebody. No one in Australia should be feeling this level of fear.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month alone, during the holy month of Ramadan, three mosques in Sydney received online bomb threats.\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Francis has appeared in Saint Peter\u2019s Square for a special Jubilee Mass for the sick, marking his first public event at the Vatican since being hospitalised with pneumonia.\n\n\n\n\n\nArriving in a wheelchair, the Pope smiled and waved to the applauding crowd before being brought to the front of the altar where he greeted those present.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pontiff then received the Sacrament of Reconciliation inside the basilica, prayed, and then passed through the Holy Door to greet pilgrims.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong them was Jessica Cardenas from the United Statess.\n\n\n\n\n\n''It was a beautiful experience.

        "text": "Opposition leader Peter Dutton has apologised after admitting the Coalition's election policy to stop working from home arrangements for public servants was a \"mistake\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter initially vowing to bring back public servants to the office five days per week if it won government, the Coalition now will not change the current flexible working from home policies, and there would be no mandated minimum number of days for public servants to work in the office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've made a mistake in relation to the policy,\" Dutton told Nine's Today program on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We apologise for that. And we've dealt with it.\"\n\n\n\nAsked whether he was seeking \"forgiveness\" from female voters, Dutton replied: \"I think I think I am today.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to spend taxpayer's money efficiently, but I think Labor's been able to get away with twisting this into something it wasn't.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How working from home has become a federal election battleground\n\nThe Coalition has also walked back a vow to cut 41,000 Canberra-based public service jobs. It still plans to reduce the Australian Public Service by 41,000 over five years, but has ruled out achieving it through forced redundancies.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, this would be done through a hiring freeze and natural attrition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move comes after working from home policies became an election issue in recent weeks, following Opposition public service spokesperson Jane Hume saying last month a Coalition government would force all Commonwealth public servants to return to the office five days per week, with limited exceptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nDutton at the time said the policy would save wasteful government spending and increase productivity, saying he didn't think it was \"unreasonable\" that public servants be asked to return to working in the office.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition later watered the initial proposal down to \"pre-COVID levels\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, Dutton appeared to scale back his stance further, indicating public service workers across the country \u2014 with the exception of workers in Canberra \u2014 would still be offered some flexible working arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The policy doesn't affect anybody except for public servants in Canberra. I strongly support work from home. I've been very clear about that, and our policy doesn't have any impact in the private sector, doesn't have any impact on the public sector outside of Canberra,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've said very clearly that where you've got existing arrangements which happen in Canberra now in the public service, you have EBAs that are there that allow for work from home arrangements, we are not proposing to change those and that's the reality.\"\n\n\n\nJane Hume said the Coalition had \"listened\" and understood that flexible work is part of \"getting the best out of any workforce\". Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas In a statement released on Sunday night, Hume said the party had \"listened\" and \"understand that flexible work, including working from home, is part of getting the best out of any workforce\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need the best from our public servants, and that is why there will be no change to flexible working arrangements or working from home arrangements for the public service under a Coalition government,\" she said.\n\n\n\nPolicy reversal comes after backlash\n\nThe Coalition's initial announcement that it would mandate public servants to return to the office full-time was met with strong backlash from Labor and the Greens, who said it would particularly impact working women requiring flexible working arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor senator Katy Gallagher criticised the Liberal approach as a \"step in the wrong direction for women\", while the Greens' Barbara Pocock said the policy would \"punish women and carers\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth accused the party of borrowing policies from United States President Donald Trump. One of Trump's first policies this year was to order all government workers to return to the office.\n\n\n\n\"It seems that every other idea is being stolen from the United States, and they clearly have no idea about how working families manage modern life,\" Gallagher told ABC radio last month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Across the economy, working from home arrangements are in place. They are a feature of modern workplaces,\" she said. \"They allow women in particular [the chance] to manage some of the other responsibilities they have outside of the workplace.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPocock had called the plan a \"clueless knee-jerk, Trumpian response\" that would \"drive women and those with caring responsibilities to reduce their participation in paid work and force them back into insecure low-paid jobs\".\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese also accused Dutton of \"lazily\" taking cues from Trump's administration.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nHere at the Imperial Hotel in the Sydney suburb of Erskineville, it's time to celebrate.\n\n\n\n\n\nHeritage Minister Penny Sharpe says the hotel has just been listed on the New South Wales Heritage Register.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The State Heritage Register gives special recognition to buildings but also to places. And what it does is it tells the story of what has been important to various communities. It's not just about old buildings. And the listing... of the Imperial Hotel really recognises its very rich queer history.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat important history is vast and varied.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo begin with, the Imperial Hotel features in the beloved 1994 film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\n\n\n\n\n\nA live drag show inspired by the film is performed here every Saturday night.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the hotel has been at the heart of Sydney's LGBTIQ+ community for decades, since it was taken over in 1983 by local businesswoman Dawn O'Donnell, a year before the state decriminalised homosexuality - at the urging of then Premier Neville Wran.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think we've been dodging the issue. We've got to bring our laws in NSW into line with the other states.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformer Miss 3-D once worked for several years for Dawn, before Ms O'Donnell's arrival in the inner west, as the fight for rights kept expanding.\n\n\n\n\n\nMiss 3-D says she wasted no time in transforming the hotel into a vibrant hub for the LGBTIQ plus community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Apparently it was quite a working class pub before she took it over. And she really changed the whole face of the gay scene, Dawn did. On Oxford Street and here as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney MP Tanya Plibersek says the listing celebrates the hotel's significance as the longest-running queer-friendly venue outside Oxford Street.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's an iconic Sydney venue that tells a very important story about how our city has changed... This goes along with the Commonwealth's support for the listing of the original 1978 Mardi Gras route on the Commonwealth heritage list. It's so important to tell the story of all our communities in Sydney and in Australia, and the history of the LGBTIQ plus community in Sydney is an important to tell and to preserve.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides its community significance though, Night Time Economy Minister John Graham hopes the listing will bring tourism dollars to the city - which some say still needs a boost after COVID.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sydney's night time economy is bouncing back. This is a big moment to market. We've lost some of our music heritage recently. I'm thinking about the Burwood home of the Young brothers from AC/DC. Demolished actual notes, to be replaced by a development. We really need to market better; that's why today is so significant. It's part of a broader plan to represent our music history, our venue heritage, across Sydney.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means, when all is said and done, the Imperial Hotel will be recognised and preserved for future generations - so says miss 3D.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "In 2008, genetic DNA testing was all the rage. Time Magazine hailed the invention as \"absolutely revolutionary\", with American genomics company 23andMe leading the charge.\n\n\n\n\n\n23andMe had launched two years earlier with a simple premise: if you could know more about your DNA, you could understand your ancestry, your risk factors for health conditions, and you could even ensure your medical treatment was personalised.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, millions of customers have used the company's mail-back saliva test for analysis.\n\n\n\nBut almost 20 years later \u2014 and two years after hackers gained access to millions of its profiles \u2014 23andme has gone bust. The company filed for bankruptcy in March.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, has the so-called genetic revolution delivered all it promised?\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Phillipp Bayer, an expert in bioinformatics, told SBS News: \"It turns out biology is always more complicated than what we hoped.\"\n\n\n\n\"Back then, we didn't know how much one of these pieces of DNA can tell you about someone's disease or propensity to disease or probability to develop some other malady in your life. We just didn't know.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBayer said there are always far more factors working on figuring these outcomes, not just a single data point.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a lot we don't understand about using biological data to predict the future, and there have been unexpected impacts of its use.\n\n\n\nData could 'compromise' you\n\nDr Jan Charbonneau, an adjunct researcher at the Centre for Law and Genetics at the University of Tasmania, spoke to SBS about the potential risks of genetic data.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said that for some customers in the United States, the results of genetic data testing can have unexpected impacts on eligibility for health insurance.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO What does the genetic data revolution look like, now 23andMe is going bankrupt? SBS News 05/04/2025 06:47 Play\n\n\"When you sign up for health insurance through your company, you attest that you do not know of any genetic predispositions,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you've had a 23andMe test, that's not part of your health record.\n\n\n\n\"But by saying no, thinking you're keeping your genetic results out of the official records, of course that could compromise your health insurance later.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2008, the US government passed the Genetic Information Non-discrimination Act, which protects against genetic discrimination in employment, a law that was expanded to include health insurance plans a year later.\n\n\n\nCalls for similar laws in Australia\n\nIn Australia, a doctors' group has been campaigning for similar legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government announced in September 2024 that it would ban genetic discrimination in life insurance, but no legislation has passed yet.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate professor Julian Rait, the vice-president of the Australian Medical Association (AMA), says the future of the ban is uncertain with the upcoming federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We would hope that, in the new term of whatever government might follow, we would be able to advocate for that legislation being passed and obviously then promulgated so that people are better protected,\" Rait told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nRait says the AMA still believes genetics and genomics will transform the healthcare sector and should be incorporated into everyday healthcare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he says people should consult their doctor when considering undertaking a test.\n\n\n\nPrivacy risks\n\nRait also said that genetic testing brings cybersecurity risks and privacy concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not just your own DNA. In some ways, it's also shared by many family members,\" Rait said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's the potential for information to be exposed that might not be necessarily to the comfort of all the other members of the family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer customers of 23andMe are also asking questions about what to do with their data, now 23andMe has filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n\n\nRait said there are concerns around data protection, with some customer data appearing on the dark web after 23andMe experienced a data breach in 2023.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How much data do Australians give away and how much are we at risk?\n\nBut it's the legitimate sale of the company's assets as the bankruptcy proceeds that is also raising questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company has said in a statement that the sale would not impact how customer data is managed, but the attorney-general of California, where the company's headquarters is located, has warned customers to consider deleting their data.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Labor has promised to subsidise the cost of a solar power battery, which could save households thousands per year in energy bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe $2.3 billion program would offer a 30 per cent discount to households and small businesses buying a typical battery \u2014 a saving of roughly $4,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor estimates millions of households could save between $1,100 and $2,300 each year on energy bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's what you need to know about the program.\n\n\n\nHow would the batteries reduce bills?\n\nHouseholds with solar power batteries can save money by reducing demand on the grid, energy finance analyst Jay Gordon told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Batteries can feed energy back into the grid during the evening peak time, and now that's the time where typically solar energy is declining, demand is growing and so we often fall back on really expensive sources of electricity like gas,\" said Gordon, who is from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So the more you can feed back lower cost energy from batteries to that period, the more you can lower the overall cost of energy.\"\n\n\n\nWhere would the batteries come from?\n\nTim Buckley, a director at public interest think tank Climate Energy Finance, said around 60 per cent of battery cells and parts are made in China.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told SBS News that once parts are imported from China, Australian manufacturers assemble the batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we increase installs by 300, 400, or even 500 per cent, and then this policy stays in place out to 2030, then there absolutely is every probability that Australian suppliers are going to step up and be more a part of the process,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAre solar batteries safe?\n\nThere have been cases of house fires and damage caused by exploding batteries in the past , but Buckley said good quality products installed by a certified electrician would be safe to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The risks are relatively minor; any electrical product can have a fire if there's a malfunction,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's important to not conflate fires caused by low-quality electric scooters with good quality household batteries.\"\n\n\n\nWhat about renters and apartments?\n\nThe rebate would only apply to people with rooftop solar, meaning people living in an apartment and renters could miss out.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuckley said he would like to see this revised and caveats put in place for apartment blocks, so that those households aren't left behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would hope this is just the next iteration of a number of policies to make sure we deal with apartment dwellers,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There could be split incentives for renters and landlords, and policies to deal with council regulations and strata titles.\"\n\n\n\nAre the batteries sustainable?\n\nGordon explained that the batteries can create emissions when manufactured, but would result in lower emissions overall compared to gas.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said swapping to solar power batteries would shift energy consumption to zero carbon emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you consider that often for a household appliance, the life cycle of that appliance is something like 15 to 20 years, so solar really makes a significant reduction in emissions,\" he said.\n\n\n\nHow long could it take to roll out?\n\nThe program will be up and running from 1 July 2025 if Labor win the election. But how long it could take households to receive a battery and see financial benefits depends on other factors.\n\n\n\n\n\nGordon said that though the popularity of such a scheme is hard to predict, current programs like the small-scale renewable energy scheme \u2014 which the battery subsidy would be rolled out through \u2014 have been \"extremely successful\" at driving up rooftop solar uptake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's feasible to expect we could see significant numbers of batteries being installed.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Coalition will reduce the number of overseas students coming to Australia each year by around 80,000 in what it says is a bid to address housing affordability for young Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton announced on Sunday that a cap of around 25 per cent would be applied to the number of foreign students admitted to public universities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition said \"unsustainable\" migration levels were leading to housing unaffordability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The plan that we announce today is about getting young Aussies into homes more quickly and helping them afford that home,\" Dutton told reporters in Melbourne.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Coalition's plan for international students?\n\nAn elected Coalition government would allow 30,000 fewer foreign students into Australia each year compared to Labor's plan. This would set the cap of international students each year at 240,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, Labor announced it would cap international student numbers at 270,000 from 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition estimated there would be a maximum of 115,000 overseas student commencements each year at publicly funded universities and, at most, 125,000 enrolled in private and other higher education like VET courses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're cutting migration because we want to put Australians first. We want Australians into homes,\" Dutton said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition also said it would raise the student visa application charge to $5,000 for Group of Eight universities and $2,500 for remaining international students.\n\n\n\nStudents will also be charged a new $2,500 fee if they want to change education providers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition will also review a visa that allows international students to live, study and work in Australia after they've completed studies. It said the review would address the \"misuse\" of the visa, \"as a way to gain access to the Australian labour market and as a pathway to permanent migration\".\n\n\n\nDutton says students save on commute\n\nDutton was asked how a student cap \u2014 which would largely impact metropolitan areas \u2014 would help a first-time home buyer in the suburbs.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe responded by flagging that the Coalition's promise to bring down the cost of petrol would save students money at the bowser.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Are international students to blame for the housing crisis?\n\n\"If you're spending an hour and a half in a car, even a little Mazda2, or if you've got a bigger, gas-guzzling car, you're probably going to save, as a university student under our policy, maybe two tanks a week,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Two tanks a week. That's probably 30 bucks a week you're going to save as a university student. That is a huge saving.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe went on to say that students are buying houses across metropolitan and outer metropolitan areas, but have faced a \"housing crunch\" under the Labor government.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition said the number of international students studying in Australia rose from almost 520,000 international students in the year to the last election, to more than 850,000 in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent study found international students were \"not the culprits of the rental crisis in Australia\", with its authors \"rejecting the assumption that the growth of international students 'caused' or exacerbated the housing crisis in Australia\".\n\n\n\nGreens, universities criticise Coalition plan\n\nThe Greens criticised the Coalition's plan and accused the party of a \"cynical attempt to scapegoat\" migrants and international students for the housing and rental crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Dutton's plan to slash student numbers and triple visa fees is a cynical ploy to stoke fear and division in the lead-up to an election,\" deputy Greens leader and spokesperson for higher education Mehreen Faruqi said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFaruqi also accused Labor of \"starting this round of punching down on international students\" by pushing for their own caps last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The facts are clear, we've seen the evidence: international students are not the cause of skyrocketing rents or unaffordable housing. That responsibility lies squarely with successive governments who have refused to build enough public housing and prioritised lining the pockets of wealthy property investors.\"\n\n\n\nGreens deputy leader Mehreen Faruqi accused the Coalition of \"scapegoating\" migrants and international students. Source: AAP / Bianca De Marchi Universities Australia, meanwhile, said the proposal would cause economic damage and would not solve the housing crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Students make up less than six per cent of the national rental market. The real solution is more homes, not fewer students,\" said CEO Luke Sheehy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We urge all parties to base policy on facts, not finger-pointing. We're ready to work constructively on real solutions, but cuts like these will only harm the nation's prosperity at a time we can least afford it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup of Eight chief executive Vicki Thomson said the Coalition's plan was \"the wrong policy at the wrong time\", and that blaming international students for the housing crisis was \"flawed\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It beggars belief that the Coalition would single out the [Group of Eight] for extra burden \u2014 Australia's top universities all ranked in the world's top 100 \u2014 that attract the best and brightest minds from our region and around the world,\" Thomson said.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We picked a number one invention of the year and this year it is the retail DNA test, pioneered by a company called 23andMe. Essentially what it is, it comes in this box, you open it up, inside is a vial, you spit in the vial, you send them the spit and they will scan your genome and they will tell you what health conditions you might be at risk for. We consider this to be an absolutely revolutionary invention that will change forever the way we think about healthcare and the way we think about our personal information.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was Time Magazine's announcement of the invention of the year in 2008.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company 23andMe had begun two years earlier in 2006 with a simple premise.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you could know more about your DNA, you could understand your ancestry, your risk factors for health conditions and could even ensure your medical treatment was personalised for you.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in the almost twenty years since the arrival of 23andMe, has the genetic revolution actually happened?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No. It turns out biology is always more complicated than what we hoped.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was Dr Philipp Bayer, one of the researchers behind an open-source database for people who had completed a direct-to-consumer genetic testing kit to upload their results.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the group created OpenSNP in 2011 to open access to everyone, not just the pharmaceutical companies that could afford access to commercial data sets.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey hoped that by increasing access to genetic data, more medical discoveries could occur.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a blog post, a fellow researcher said it would give the individual the choice to contribute rather than having researchers or companies broker the access.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Dr Bayer says genetic research hasn't gone the way that was expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And back then we didn't know how much one of these pieces of DNA can tell you about someone's disease or propensity to disease or probability to develop some other melody in your life. We just didn't know back then, and by now, 14 years later, we know that the biology is always more complicated than you assume. There's always far more factors working on figuring these outcomes, and it's just not the single data point that can help you predict what's happening.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Jan Charbonneau is an adjunct researcher at the Centre for Law and Genetics at the University of Tasmania.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says that for some customers in the US, the results of genetic data testing can actually have unexpected impacts on eligibility for health insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you sign up for health insurance through your company, whatever, you attest that you do not know of any genetic predispositions. Well, if you've had a 23 and me test, of course that's not part of your health record. But by saying no thinking, you're keeping your genetic results out of the official records. Of course that could compromise your health insurance later.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2008, the US Government passed the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act which protects against genetic discrimination in employment, a law that was expanded to include health insurance plans a year later.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, a doctors group has been campaigning for similar legislation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government announced in September 2024 that it would ban genetic discrimination in life insurance - but no legislation has passed yet.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian Medical Association vice president, Associate Professor Julian Rait, says the future of the ban is uncertain as we head into a federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well look, we are still confident that the government's heart is in the right place about this particular piece of legislation. Obviously it\u2019s been deferred as a consequence of the election and we would hope that in the new term of whatever the government might follow that we would be able to advocate for that legislation being passed and obviously then promulgated so that people are better protected.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe AMA's statement on genetic testing says genomics will rapidly transform the sector, and should be incorporated into everyday healthcare.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Associate Professor Rait says people should consult their doctor when considering one of these tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The AMA has forewarned since about 2012 of the ethical challenges of genetic testing, in particular the privacy risk and also the cybersecurity risks, because of the shared nature of the information. It's not just your own DNA in some ways, it's also shared by many family members. And so, therefore there's the potential for information to be exposed that might not be necessarily, you know, to the comfort of all the other members of the family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers behind OpenSNP have decided to delete all of their data, along with their website, at the end of April.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Bayer says the decision comes from a cost benefit analysis amid the issues with 23andMe - and the growth of far right governments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Is this data actually helping people or will it be used to the detriment of people and to us currently looks like it'll be more used to the detriment of people. So that's triggered this decision.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer customers of 23andMe are also asking questions about what to do with their data, now 23andMe have filed for bankruptcy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Rait says there are concerns around data protection, with some customer data appearing on the dark web after 23andMe experienced a data breach in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's the legitimate sale of the company's assets as the bankruptcy proceeds that is also raising questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company has said in a statement that the sale would not impact how customer data is managed, but the Attorney-General of California, where the company's headquarters is located, has warned customers to consider deleting their data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now there are procedures in place to be able to go in and ask 23andMe to delete your data. My question has always been, first off, will they do it? They tell you they're going to do it. What kind of confirmation do we have other than you get an email from them saying, we've deleted your data. But when you shop and think where that data has gone, how could we possibly delete it from these large databases?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Charbonneau says the sale of the company will result in the sale of their information.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says some customers might not understand yet that's what could happen - given they had to read 13 different documents to understand what they were signing up for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, even as lawyers, we have struggled with some of them and I wonder if the general public, what do they make of a jurisdiction clause? What do they make about assigning their rights in their DNA? Do they understand what these things mean in terms of their actual protections?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Charbonneau has one piece of advice for those who are still considering a direct to consumer DNA test: to consider everything.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not often a brand-new federal electorate is created.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Western Australia, the seat of Bullwinkel is the latest example.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first member for Bullwinkel will be elected at the upcoming federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor local resident and sheep farmer Peter Boyle, the live sheep export issue is key to his economic livelihood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've been farming here since 1855. I don't know where we are going to go next year, because there's huge reduction in sheep numbers all around us. We won't be able to buy shore sheep and fatten them for my type of market. It's going to be very difficult even to supply it for live shipping.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government has announced it is banning live sheep exports by 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition says it has a clear mandate to reverse the ban\u2014promising to \"Keep the Sheep\" if it wins the upcoming election.\n\n\n\n\n\nNationals leader David Littleproud says the first step would be restoring trust with Middle Eastern trading partners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My first international trip will be to Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, to Morocco - to show them some respect, that we are an important part of their food security. And we should be a trusted partner that they can rely on. And when this madness has ended, and that they can rely on us to continue to send with the best animal welfare standards in the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the fight for Bullwinkel is about more than just agriculture.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new federal seat was introduced to accommodate Western Australia\u2019s growing population - bringing WA\u2019s total to 16 federal electorates.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpanning Perth\u2019s eastern suburbs and parts of the Wheatbelt, it bridges two very different communities - each with their own priorities.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurtin University political expert, John Phillimore, says that mix makes it difficult to predict the outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Notionally a Labor seat, with a pretty close margin of two to three per cent. But I think most commentators would expect that in a normal federal election year, it would probably be a marginal Liberal seat because Labor got such a huge vote last time around.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the Coalition, the key challenge is making rural issues resonate with suburban voters - where cost of living is the biggest concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a small barbershop in the heart of the electorate, shop owner Hussein Naser says times are tough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has four kids, a mortgage and runs his own business\u2014but with rising costs, he's struggling to keep up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I\u2019ve had to cut the staff down because customers stopped spending enough money. We still have the same customers, but they don\u2019t come as regularly as before. So some of them, every fortnight, they then come every month.

So, I am a nurse, I've been a nurse for a long time, I've lived in this area for 20 odd years. I know this area very well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for voters like Hussein Naser, the biggest issue isn\u2019t just what politicians promise - it\u2019s whether they follow through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Politicians will promise you lots of stuff. But if they promise ten things, how many will actually be done?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd when it comes to the race for Bullwinkel, the answer may depend on party politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike at the federal level, where the Coalition is united, the Nationals and Liberals in WA risk splitting the vote - especially if they clash on state issues.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "That\u2019s not what is supposed to happen, nor what the Trump administration expected to happen. The theory and history says that, when tariffs are imposed, the currency of the country imposing them strengthens and to some extent blunts the impacts of the tariffs of its own consumers and companies, who (despite what Trump claims) are the ones who actually pay the tariffs in the form of increased prices. Wall Street melted down on Friday and more pain is ahead. Credit: Bloomberg A 2019 International Monetary Fund study of 151 countries between 1963 and 2014 showed that tariff increases did result in real exchange rate appreciation. (It also showed, despite what the Trump administration believes, that the tariffs had only a modest effect on trade balances). There\u2019s a simple explanation for why the US dollar should be rising. Tariffs raise the prices and therefore reduce the demand for imports, which means there\u2019s less need for US companies to exchange dollars for imported goods, fewer dollars in circulation and, with less supply, higher \u201cprices\u201d for the currency.\n\nThe fact that hasn\u2019t happened could be due to a number of factors. Loading An obvious one would be that investors and traders believe the US is shooting itself in the foot and that the damage to its economy will be greater than that on the economies they are shifting their exposures too. The tariffs will lower US growth, employment and investment and lift the inflation rate, risking stagflation, or higher inflation with lower growth. That was what the Federal Reserve Board chair, Jerome Powell, was alluding to last week when he said tariffs were likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation but it was also possible that it could be more persistent.\n\nThe Fed had a bruising experience with what it thought was going to be the \u201ctransitory\u201d spike in inflation cause by the pandemic\u2019s impact on global supply chains. Four years after US inflation started to surge, it remains elevated and above the Fed\u2019s target even as the US economy has slowed and before Trump\u2019s tariffs and their negative impacts on inflation and growth hit home. In the past, the dollar has strengthened even during US recessions, so the immediate reaction to Trump\u2019s tariffs, and the big bets against the dollar mounting in futures markets, suggests there is something different this time. The US dollar is not doing what Trump wants it to do. Credit: Bloomberg The tariffs, the assault on the global free trade order that the US built and encouraged (and profited from) and the trade war Trump has initiated, against not just perceived foes but America\u2019s closest trading partners, geopolitical allies and the poorest economies in the world, might be undermining the dollar\u2019s status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. There might be a developing structural element to the dollar\u2019s unusual response, driven by a backlash against Trump\u2019s actions, which underscore the vulnerability of other economies, have heightened mistrust of America and have raised question marks over the longer-term potential of its economy.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that, even as the punitive and irrational tariffs regime is being implemented, the Republicans in the Senate have introduced Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d of tax breaks and spending cuts, a bill the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says would add $US5.8 trillion to US primary deficits between 2026 and 2034 and which it says would be \u201chistorically unprecedented in its fiscal irresponsibility.\u201d The bill would not only extend the $US4.5 trillion of tax cuts for the wealthy from Trump\u2019s first term, which are scheduled to expire later this year, but had more than $US1.5 trillion for the abolition of tax cuts on tips and other pledges Trump made during the election campaign. The tariffs will lower US growth, employment and investment and lift the inflation rate, risking stagflation, or higher inflation with lower growth. When added to the impact of the tariffs on the economy, the massive increase in America\u2019s already daunting debt and deficit burden is occurring at the most delicate moment in the country\u2019s post-war history. The dominance of the US dollar in global trade and finance has meant that, regardless of domestic economic conditions or policies, the US has been able to attract foreign investment to its markets and economy.\n\nForeign governments have seen it as a safe and stable place to park their savings, investors have seen it as a source of higher and less volatile returns and companies have acquired US dollars in exchange for the goods they have sold into the world\u2019s largest consumer market. Now the world doesn\u2019t see America as safe or stable, and the tariffs mean US corporates profits will fall, as will the need for investment capital, and the market for foreign goods will shrink. The US has, since 1944, enjoyed what the former French finance minister, Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, once termed an \u201cexorbitant privilege.\u201d It costs almost nothing to print a dollar but other countries have to supply $US1 of goods or services to acquire one. Loading That has underpinned a period of more than 80 years when the rest of the world has effectively subsidised the US economy and its citizens\u2019 standards of living. Regardless of its economic fundamentals, it has been able to borrow more cheaply, buy goods more cheaply, leverage the dollar into geopolitical dominance and never have to fear a balance of payments crisis because the dollar status has effectively given it unlimited foreign exchange reserves.",

Credit: Charlotte Grieve\n\nIt was Doves versus Redbacks, and a loyal Doves supporter \u2013 Hill dodged a photo with the winning team, the Redbacks from Hampton Park, which just happens to be outside of his electorate. \u201cI\u2019m Doveton all the way!\u201d\n\nAlso in tow was Casey mayor Stefan Koomen, who was in a precarious position as his council area spans both teams. \u201cI\u2019m considering getting a scarf of both teams knitted together,\u201d he said, smiling but serious.\n\nHill spoke with locals about AFL history, and caught up with Doveton Soccer Club president Daniel McMinimee \u2013 whose club benefited recently from around $200,000 in federal funding to upgrade facilities.\n\n\u201cFirst time we\u2019ve had lights on our ground since it\u2019s been built,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a fan of Julian\u2019s.\u201d\n\nHill with Dusty the puppy Ridgeback. Credit: Charlotte Grieve\n\nHill says political comments don\u2019t go down well on weekends, but he makes one \u201cevidence-based\u201d exception: \u201cBasically for 10 years, the whole city of greater Dandenong got literally nothing from the feds, literally nothing, because every grants program was pork-barrelled and rorted.\u201d\n\nHill points to $7.5 million given to Doveton pool by the current government, which was allocated after he encouraged the community to make a grant application with a business case. \u201cI haven\u2019t delivered everything the community wants, but I can say we\u2019ve delivered programs, everything according to need.\u201d\n\nAfter a quick pat with Dusty the puppy Ridgeback, and pop into the changerooms for a photo with the Doveton players, he\u2019s back on the road.\n\nBruce voter Bahanita Danish plans to vote for the Liberal candidate Zahid Safi. Credit: Charlotte Grieve\n\nNext stop is a 10-minute drive away.\n\nThe stubbie-holders and sausages are replaced with charcoaled meats and hennaed hands at the Narwoz festival, also known as the Afghan new year, held in a Hallam park.\n\nHill was asked to make a speech at the last minute so took a seat and started tapping away at his phone. Politicians of all persuasions sat in the front row, including Victorian Liberal MP Ann-Marie Hermans, state Labor MP Lee Tarlamis and Greens candidate for Bruce, Rhonda Garad.\n\n\u201cIt must be election year, with all the politicians here,\u201d the MC told the crowd.\n\nIn his speech, Hill said Narwoz was an ancient celebration and time for renewal.\n\n\u201cNarwoz Mubarak everyone!\u201d he said. \u201cEid Mubarak to our Muslim brothers and sisters!\u201d\n\nHill praised Australia\u2019s democracy and said the upcoming federal election was a reminder of \u201chow lucky we are to live in a democracy where we do have the great privilege to vote and choose our governments\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe majority of people in the world do not,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI get asked this in my role \u2013 what\u2019s an Australian? An Australian, to me, is anyone committed to our country and to the principle of mutual respect for their fellow Australians.\n\n\u201cWhen you come to this country, no one expects you to leave your culture at the door. Quite the opposite. Australia encourages people to celebrate their culture, to cherish the traditions and pass them onto their kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we can celebrate our freedom, spare a thought for the people in Afghanistan right now where Narwoz is banned. And the women and girls who are not even allowed to show their faces or be seen in society.\u201d\n\nBruce is home to Victoria\u2019s largest Afghan community, and will be an influential voter base this election.\n\nAfghan-born Liberal candidate Zahid Safi could not be seen at the event. Victorian Liberal Opposition Leader Brad Battin was the party\u2019s representative on the speaker list.\n\n\u201cJulian, we keep meeting at events. It\u2019s good to see you here again. It\u2019s great to be out with you,\u201d Battin told the crowd, before praising the event and community.\n\n\u201cWe get to have events like this, where people from all colours of our persuasion in our democracy come here together.\u201d\n\nSitting next to me in the crowd was Pashto-teacher Bahanita Danish. She said Safi might be nervous to attend after being heckled earlier in the week at the Doveton mosque. Danish will be voting for Safi this election, she said, after he visited her school in recent months.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very kind,\u201d she said. \u201cI think change is coming.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the crowd, a young man named Ahmed Ahmedi said \u201cfor now\u201d he will vote Labor over what he said was a better record on immigration. \u201cBecause it\u2019s good for people from overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cGood for immigration.\u201d\n\nBut he said he had to learn more, as there was a bad \u201ccourt decision\u201d that he heard about, but could not elaborate further.\n\nLabor\u2019s response to the High Court ruling that found indefinite detention was illegal, including fewer rights for detainees and tougher deportation laws, has been criticised by human rights groups as draconian.\n\nSaturday on the hustings wouldn\u2019t be complete without a baby\u2019s head being kissed. Hill was chatting to a young mother on the sidelines of the cultural event, who excitedly passed her baby to the politician for a cuddle.\n\n\u201cI love babies,\u201d he said, to smiles all around. \u201cShe\u2019s so cute.\u201d",

Credit: Bloomberg\n\nBally\u2019s appeared as a potential suitor for Star in March, just as Star was offloading its stake in the Queen\u2019s Wharf casino resort in Brisbane to the Hong Kong-based Far East Consortium and Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, and was in talks with investment company Salter Brothers to secure a $940 million lifeline.\n\nHowever, talks with Salter Brothers were scotched at the start of April, opening the door for Star\u2019s board to reengage with Bally\u2019s.",

        "text": "For those dreaming of building their ideal home, a 'rare opportunity' has just emerged. There's just one problem.\n\nA vacant lot of land in Longueville, on Sydney's North Shore, is selling with an unmovable electrical substation. Source: Belle Property\n\nEmpty lots of land are becoming increasingly uncommon in Australia\u2019s inner-city suburbs. As our population soars and vacancy rates plummet, they're quite a rare gem in today\u2019s market.\n\nBut for those dreaming of building their ideal home from the ground up, a unique opportunity has just surfaced in the leafy suburb of Longueville \u2014 just eight kilometres north of Sydney\u2019s CBD, or a quick 15-minute drive.\n\nThere is, however, a significant catch.\n\nThis narrow North Shore plot, just 235 square metres, comes with a large, shed-sized electrical substation \u2014 and it\u2019s not going anywhere. Ausgrid, which is selling the land, holds an easement over the site. That means the company retains permanent legal rights to access and maintain the substation, even after the property changes hands.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMost people would recognise the familiar sight \u2014 a big green box marked with \"danger\" signs \u2014 quietly positioned in both city and country settings, often blending into the background. But in this case, it\u2019s hard to miss.\n\nAn easement grants Ausgrid full access rights, meaning buyers would have to work around the big green box if they plan to develop the site. Source: Google Maps\n\nCan you remove an electrical substation from newly-purchased property?\n\nSo, can the new owner remove it? In short: No. Not without Ausgrid\u2019s approval anyway.\n\nThe substation must stay put. The easement grants Ausgrid full rights to operate, upgrade, and enter the property as needed, and interfering with this infrastructure could lead to serious legal consequences.\n\nIn essence, you're buying the land \u2014 but sharing it with a permanent piece of electrical infrastructure you can\u2019t move, modify, or ignore.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWith a bit of imagination and the right architect \u2014 or as Belle Property puts it, \"those with vision\" \u2014 there could be workarounds, such as integrating the substation into the home\u2019s design, or using clever screening and landscaping to soften its presence.\n\nBut the substation is, at least for now, here to stay. \"This compact block offers endless potential ... A rare find in a tightly held enclave,\" Belle wrote on the online listing, which doesn't offer a price guide. The listing does however show the lot and substation from a strategic aerial angle, with much of it obscured by a well-placed tree.\n\nThis isn't the first instance of Ausgrid selling surplus assets. In 2021, it sold four blocks in Wahroonga, and in 2022, it sold a 2.86-hectare property in Zetland.\n\nThe latest lot is among a handful of similar listings from Ausgrid. Belle Property's Sam Harrison told the Sydney Morning Herald there's been plenty of interest from young people looking for a \"very affordable\" entry point into the market.\n\nMake sure you do your research\n\nWhile in this instance, the substation is unlikely to catch prospective buyers by surprise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut back in 2023, a family who made the \"rookie error\" of \"not paying attention to\" the land survey before building their dream home were left shattered after discovering an \"unattractive\" green box centimetres from their bedroom windows during a check-up.\n\nThe transformer box \u2014 a metal unit that contains electrical equipment, used to reduce high-voltage power to a lower-voltage that can be safely used in homes \u2014 was always set to be installed in the spot, but the family say they didn't realise before building started.\n\nThey said that they'd embarked on a routine check-up of the home's progress, in Sydney's west, when they noticed the eyesore, later revealing their grave mistake of not checking the land survey.\n\nThe box can't be moved or adjusted in any way, and due to various landscaping restrictions, also can't be decorated in greenery. According to one property expert, it can even decrease the value of the home by up to 10 per cent.\n\nIn Longueville, which boasts a boasts a median house price of approximately $5.66 million, it remains to be seen if the substation has the same impact on the lot's eventual selling price.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
