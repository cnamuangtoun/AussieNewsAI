From studio visits, intimate interviews, and live issues, we take art out of the gallery and into your ears.\n\nHowever, Creative Australia controversially withdrew his commission less than a week later, after Coalition arts spokesperson Claire Chandler raised in parliament issues with works by Sabsabi from more than 15 years ago.\n\nSabsabi's gallerist, Josh Milani, says Creative Australia's decision to withdraw Sabsabi's Biennale commission has harmed the artist's career.\n\n\"From the moment he was sacked by Creative Australia for the Venice Biennale commission, the curators at MUMA started receiving pressure from their superiors,\" Milani says.\n\n\"This cancellation is a direct result of Creative Australia's complete abandonment of him as an artist and a human being.\n\n\"They have allowed the mischaracterisation of him as a terrorist sympathiser to go unchecked.\"\n\nThe show, Stolon Press: Flat Earth, was due to open on May 8 and had been planned 18 months in advance.\n\nIt featured the work of Stolon Press \u2014 a Sydney-based collective and Sabsabi's longtime collaborator \u2014 Elisa Taber, a writer and anthropologist who divides her time between Montreal and Buenos Aires, and Sabsabi.\n\nAccording to the MUMA website, Sabsabi was due to present \"large, coffee-infused calligraphic paintings rooted in tasawwuf (Sufism), alongside abstracted silhouette works that employ numerology and repetition to explore spirituality and our shared human condition\".\n\nIndustry upheaval over artist dropped from cultural event Photo shows Two man stand on street wearing black suits.

        "text": "When news came through last week that Tom Jenkins would be playing fullback for Penrith in their grand final rematch with Melbourne, the reaction from outside the Panthers was literal disbelief.\n\nSurely, the scuttlebutt went, it was a smokescreen and coach Ivan Cleary would switch high-profile recruit Blaize Talagi to the back.\n\nJenkins, usually a winger or centre with limited first-grade experience who had just returned to Penrith after a year with Newcastle, could only be a decoy amid a horde of injuries to Penrith's fullbacks Dylan Edwards and Daine Laurie.\n\nIt's true that the 24-year-old Jenkins was light on experience as a custodian \u2014 apart from a few minutes there filling in for the club's NSW Cup side the week before, when the starter underwent an HIA, he hadn't played there in years.\n\nAnd, on the surface, he was an unlikely person for the Panthers to turn to in such a difficult time given he struggled to crack the Knights' back line last season and began the summer training with St Mary's in the Ron Massey Cup, the tier below reserve grade.\n\nBut once the whistle blew in Melbourne, it was indeed Jenkins at fullback and the first game of his second life with Penrith turned out to be the best of his young career.\n\nThe undermanned Panthers went down 30-24 but Jenkins was a shining light, playing a role in four tries against one of the few teams who could be in the mix to end Penrith's run of premierships.\n\nHe's retained his spot in first grade this week and will line up in the far more familiar role of centre on Thursday night against South Sydney \u2014 Laurie has been named to return from a quad injury but should he withdraw, Jenkins could play fullback again.\n\nIf so, the 24-year-old will jump at the chance. After the journey he's been on back to the club he calls home, there's nothing he won't do for them.\n\n\"Coming into Dyl's shoes is a hard one, he's the Australian fullback. But it's another role, another job, if I have to do it again or another role through the year, you never know \u2014 Nathan [Cleary] is out this week, so maybe halfback!\" Jenkins said.\n\n\"But I'm just keen, if Ivan puts me in there, it's because he believes in me.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Penrith, Jenkins has always fought hard to make the most of every opportunity.\n\nThat's how the Young Cherrypickers junior ended up with the Panthers in the first place. At 18, after failing to pick up a contract with Canberra, he played for a Group 9 rep side against a Panthers development squad and did well enough to land a deal with the club.\n\nJenkins left Penrith in search of consistent NRL football. (Getty Images: Ian Hitchcock)\n\nHe rose through the ranks, playing a handful of NRL matches in 2022-23 before signing a two-year deal with Newcastle in search of a regular first-grade spot.\n\n\"Penrith feels like home and they gave me my first opportunity. But I probably needed to leave, to go away and chase an opportunity, for my own development and my own career,\" Jenkins said.\n\n\"I don't regret it, I think it's exactly what I needed \u2014 to go away and experience different things, a different club.\n\n\"I knew it was probably coming. They had Bizza [Brian To'o], Taylan [May], Tito [Sunia Turuva], a lot of boys who were successful, so my path to NRL was blocked.\n\n\"Ivan [Cleary] is always open, no matter how hard the conversation is, he'll always have it with you directly, no matter what.\n\n\"He'll tell you exactly what you need to know, whether you like it or not. I didn't want to leave, and he knew I didn't want to leave, but he knew I had to leave to chase an opportunity.\"\n\nJenkins only played a handful of games in an unhappy year with Newcastle. (Getty Images: Mark Kolbe)\n\nBut the move to the Hunter didn't agree with Jenkins. He played five NRL matches, all at the beginning of the season, but couldn't find his best football.\n\nAt the end of the season, he and the Knights came to an agreement that he would leave a year early.\n\n\"I wasn't present when I was in Newcastle. I was promised things but I didn't live up to the expectations. That was on me, getting ahead of myself.\n\n\"It's a good bunch of boys up there. There wasn't any bad blood in the exit. It was purely based on what I needed as a person, to come back here and be around family and enjoy my footy.\n\n\"I didn't feel like myself, I always felt drawn back to here, I wanted to be around Sydney.\"\n\nSo Jenkins came back to Penrith \u2014 first the area, then the club, because both of them are home to him.\n\nHe signed with St Mary's Saints and had a few training sessions before Panthers reserve grade coach Ben Harden gave him a call. Would Jenkins be interested in training with the club's afternoon squad over the summer?\n\nNRL live Photo shows Four Penrith NRL players stand in a group after loss to Melbourne Storm. After playing much of the match without Nathan Cleary, the Panthers still find positives in their 30-24 loss to the Storm in Melbourne.\n\nThey didn't need to ask twice. Alongside part-timers, triallists and other players desperate for a chance at joining the great Penrith winning machine, Jenkins slogged it out in the heat, with no guarantees and no promises.\n\nIn the meantime, he linked up with Our Choice, a disability service owned by a mate of his, as a support worker \u2014 which gave him a new outlook on life and football.\n\n\"That's something I'm really passionate about, I love that, I still work there on my days off and when I leave footy it's definitely something I'll go do,\" said Jenkins.\n\n\"I'd take kids out, community access, teach them independent life skills \u2014 it puts some perspective on life.\n\n\"[With footy] I just tried to work my way back, there wasn't a promise.\n\n\"I do love how Penrith roll and how they do their thing. Coming back, that's something I slotted straight into. Their standards are very high and they don't budge.\"\n\nJenkins fought to live up to those standards and took the chances when they came. With Penrith's top squad in Las Vegas for the season opener, he played in their final trial against Manly and scored a try.\n\nThen he landed a coveted full-time deal. His goal for the year was to make it back to NSW Cup and he managed it by the season opener. After two strong games, coach Cleary didn't hesitate to turn to the prodigal Panther in a time of need.\n\nTaking on the Storm at AAMI Park is a place where some of the best fullbacks in the league have lost themselves but Jenkins trusted himself to do the job, even if he'd never done it before at the top level.\n\n\"I wouldn't be there if [Ivan[ didn't have confidence in me and that's what Ivan does, he gives you confidence,\" Jenkins said.\n\nCleary has shown that confidence in Jenkins again by naming him in the centres over 18-year-old phenom Casey McLean for Thursday night's clash with South Sydney.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThe match shapes as a big one for the Panthers \u2014 they haven't dropped three games in a row since the end of 2019, well before their historic run began. Losing is not something they're familiar with anymore.\n\nThat's part of what drew Jenkins back here and why he's so grateful to be a part of it all again. All he wants is more first grade, wherever he's needed.\n\nIf you can make it at Penrith, you can probably make it anywhere \u2014 but if you make it at Penrith, why would you want to make it anywhere else?\n\n\"It didn't have to be Penrith, I wanted it to be Penrith. I know how they roll, I know how they do things, all my mates are here,\" Jenkins said.\n\n\"When I made the decision to leave [Newcastle], I didn't know what was next, but I knew Penrith was a hard system to crack and a hard squad to get into.\n\n\"It's exactly what I needed, a kick up the bum to show how good I have it and how lucky I really am. I'm really lucky, because I got to come back here.\"",

        "text": "Former Reserve Bank deputy governor Guy Debelle once quoted Doors frontman Jim Morrison in a speech when the fallout from the global financial crisis was still front of mind:\n\n\"The future's uncertain and the end is always near.\"\n\nIn his budget speech last night, Jim Chalmers was somewhat less dramatic, but the warning was very similar.\n\n\"The global economy is volatile and unpredictable,\" he cautioned.\n\n\" The 2020s have already seen a global pandemic, global inflation and the threat of a global trade war. \"\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers says global economic volatility is threatening Australia's economic and budget outlook.\n\nAlmost in the same breath as Mr Chalmers trumpeted the likelihood of a soft landing for Australia's economy in its descent from peak inflation, he warned that the global outlook could deal Australia blows on multiple fronts.\n\n\"Trade disruptions are rising, China's growth is slowing, war is still raging in Europe, and a ceasefire in the Middle East is breaking down,\" he observed.\n\nThose blows are already landing.\n\nTreasury says the global economy grew 3.3 per cent last year and is likely to growth by 3.25 per cent each year for the next three.\n\n\"If realised, this would represent the longest stretch of below-average growth since the early 1990s,\" Budget Paper 1 warned.\n\nBut things could get even worse \u2014 Treasury warned the risks to the global outlook are currently skewed to the downside.\n\n\"The global outlook remains clouded by uneven risks in the trajectory of growth, inflation and monetary policy,\" Treasury's number-crunchers noted.\n\nTrump tariffs create 'significant uncertainty and volatility'\n\nOne of the biggest risks in the short-term is US president Donald Trump's love of tariffs.\n\nIn the budget, Treasury did some modelling suggesting that a blanket 25 per cent tariff on manufactured goods coming into the US would likely take more than 0.1 of a percentage point off Australia's economic growth, while adding that much to inflation.\n\nIn Budget Paper 1, Treasury modelled the effects of 25 per cent US tariffs on manufactured goods. (Supplied: Treasury)\n\nThat's mostly because our key export destinations \u2014 such as China, Japan and Korea \u2014 would be hard hit on their exports to the US.\n\n\"The indirect effect of the tariffs is estimated to be nearly four times as large as the direct effect, reflecting the relative importance of affected trade flows between Australia, China, and the United States,\" Treasury forecast.\n\nHowever, that hit to GDP could nearly double if Australia responded with tariffs of our own.\n\nTreasury found that retaliatory tariffs could roughly double the negative effect of the US tariffs. (Supplied: Treasury)\n\nAnd Treasury warned that its modelling could significantly underestimate the economic impact from Trump's tariffs and the global reaction to them, with China, the EU, Canada and others having already announced retaliatory measures.\n\n\"Escalating trade tensions have created significant uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets,\" Budget Paper 1 noted with concern.\n\n\" These factors can compound the direct and indirect effects of tariffs on global growth captured in the scenarios above by discouraging investment and dampening consumer confidence. \"\n\nThe Grattan Institute's chief executive Aruna Sathanapally said, in a worst case scenario, an escalating trade war could rip the globalised economy apart.\n\n\"The first round effects of the tariffs isn't the main thing to worry about \u2014 that will be annoying and unwelcome and probably some bad economic policy,\" she told the ABC News budget special.\n\n\"But the effects on the global economy, and then the effects in terms of uncertainty and chaos, and what effect that has on people's investment decisions, those things we need to be really worried about.\n\n\"And even more worrying is the international order \u2014 if it breaks down, it becomes more troubling and expensive.\"\n\nIt feels like the end is nearer than usual\n\nWe're already seeing some of those effects.\n\nUS companies have been scrambling to import just about anything and everything \u2014 from cars to copper, building materials to gold bullion \u2014 in order to beat the imposition of the import taxes.\n\nThat is boosting economic activity ahead of the tariffs, but this is just bringing forward demand that will leave an even bigger hole once the import taxes come in.\n\nAustralia's leaders distracted at historic moment Photo shows Albanese and Dutton in a compositie image close up. While Australian politicians argue about power bill relief and non-existent nuclear power stations, pressing issues like the great US retreat, global warming and AI are being ignored.\n\nThen there's those knock on effects to business investment and activity.\n\nFinancial news outlet Bloomberg carried a story this week of a US project waiting on the importation of pipes from Germany, where threatened levies on Chinese shipping had indefinitely delayed delivery.\n\nThat project is now stuck in limbo and could remain so for months.\n\nSimilar stories are proliferating, and businesses are likely to defer many major investment plans until they have clarity about where global trade relationships and tariffs stand.\n\nDonald Trump is by no means the only global leader who has adopted increasingly protectionist policies in recent years.\n\n\"According to the IMF, restrictions on trade and investment have grown sixfold in the past 15 years,\" Budget Paper 1 noted.\n\nBut the sheer scale and immediacy of Trump's tariff plans threaten to dwarf even the Smoot-Hawley tariffs of Ferris Bueller fame, which infamously deepened and prolonged the Great Depression.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nJim Morrison and Guy Debelle both may have been a bit ahead of their time.

Yes, it is the last to the party. And yes, it is YASS (yet another streaming service). But it also represents something that is uncomfortably different: Max isn't here to be another streaming service; many subscribers will use it to replace Australian service BINGE.\n\nFrom launch, BINGE has sold itself as the home of HBO in Australia, the upmarket, prestige TV channel owned by Warner Bros Discovery. HBO is synonymous with the best that TV has to offer, with titles like The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, Sex & The City, The White Lotus, and The Last of Us.\n\nThe Last of Us was the most-watched debut season of a show that HBO has ever had. (HBO)\n\nBut when Max launches, all of those shows will disappear from the BINGE streaming service and become exclusive to Max. Max is, effectively, the HBO streaming service. It will also have other beloved Warner Bros Television titles like The Big Bang Theory, Rick & Morty, and Friends, along with a huge number of Discovery reality shows.\n\nIt's a great library of shows and movies, but one that we've mostly had access to for some time now.\n\nYet another streaming service\n\nThe streaming game really started in Australia 10 years ago.\n\nIn an effort to get into the market ahead of the then-impending launch of Netflix, Nine kicked things off in a meaningful way with the launch of Stan. With a strong emphasis on original Australian shows and movies, Stan has proven resilient in a market where all of its well-funded international competitors have gobbled up a lot of the more buzzy new titles.\n\nJust two months after Stan launched, Netflix came along and made its impact known. It had already launched popular original shows like House of Cards (even if we don't really talk much about that one anymore thanks to the very public fall of series star Kevin Spacey) and Orange Is The New Black.\n\nEuphoria was almost HBO's most-watched show, second only to Game of Thrones. (Supplied: HBO)\n\nSince then we have seen other international companies like Disney launch locally with Disney+, Amazon with its member-benefit Prime Video, and Paramount with Paramount+.\n\nEach of these services have large libraries of older TV shows and movies, along with a seemingly never-ending supply of new things to watch. What hasn't changed with the launch of these streamers is that we still only have 24 hours in every day, so we already have more than we could conceivably watch.\n\nWhat will be on Max?\n\nAt launch, Max will offer most of the Warner Bros Discovery channels. That includes HBO, Warner Bros, Discovery, Cartoon Network (think Looney Tunes and Powerpuff Girls), TLC, IS, and HGTV. It also includes brands like Harry Potter, the DC Comics superheroes (that includes Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash), and Game of Thrones.\n\nInterestingly, you'll notice that it doesn't seem to include anything from the Warner-Bros-Discovery-owned CNN. The US Max streaming service offers a live stream of CNN and some sports content, but that hasn't been added to any of the other international territories that Max has launched in. Whether that changes in time will depend on whether CNN is sold off, which is what most media analysts expect will happen in the coming year or two.\n\nThe internet loves to hate on Sex & the City reboot And Just Like That... but it's popular enough to have been renewed for a third season. (Supplied: HBO Max)\n\nThe big show at launch will be the second season of the hugely successful The Last of Us, which debuts in mid-April. New seasons of And Just Like That, House of The Dragon (the Game of Thrones spin-off), Euphoria, and Peacemaker are also promised to launch later this year (or 2026 in the case of Euphoria).\n\nMax also promises to launch with a library of old Hollywood classics from Turner Classic Movies (TCM). Expect titles like Casablanca, The Wizard of Oz, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, and Rebel Without a Cause. This won't be the first time Australia has received TCM, with a branded TCM channel formerly running on Foxtel. What we don't yet know is whether we will see a good mix of older titles, or whether it'll be like the old TCM channel with a static small library where viewers saw the same movies repeated ad nauseum.\n\nHow does the price compare to other streamers?\n\nThe price for Max is similar to the prices of the other major streamers. Some pricing tiers are a little more expensive than Disney+, but a bit cheaper than Netflix.\n\nThe pricing plans also give users similar access its competitors' offers. Max is offering an ad-supported cheaper tier with HD resolution, a standard tier which is also capped at HD, and a premium priced tier that streams at 4K resolution.\n\nA total of 1.25 million people in Australia tuned in to watch the first episode of House of the Dragon \u2014 that's roughly one in 20 people in the country. (Supplied: HBO)\n\nTo BINGE's credit, it has always offered 4K resolution streaming on its standard plans, while most competitors, including Max, restrict 4K streaming to the most expensive plans. With the average TV size at 50 inches in Australia and getting bigger, 4K streaming should be a default resolution and not an upsell if we want the picture on our screens to be clear with limited blur.\n\nThe question is whether Australians are willing to pay money for yet another streaming service. It is likely many subscribers will see the launch of Max as an opportunity to consider which services they are subscribing to and decide on what value they are getting from them.\n\nBut up until now, even with cost-of-living pressures mounting in everyday Australian households, the number of subscription services we pay for have been growing in number.\n\n(Supplied: Telsyte Australian Subscription Entertainment Study 2024)\n\nThe annual Telsyte survey into the local subscription video-on-demand market saw increases for all but one of the leading streaming services. While more people are opting for the cheaper, ad-supported plans, more than 70 per cent of subscribers now have more than one service.\n\nWith Max offering sought-after content, there's nothing to suggest it will be entering a market that doesn't have room for it.\n\nWhat is the future for BINGE?\n\nBINGE isn't shutting down. It continues on, but it isn't unreasonable to say there will be fewer well-known TV shows on the service and that could impact their subscriber numbers.\n\nMidway through the year, European sports company DAZN is expected to finalise its purchase of BINGE parent company Foxtel. Declining subscriber numbers will put incredible pressure on the viability of BINGE, which already sits adjacent to the sports focus of the new parent company.\n\nThe loss of HBO is happening at the worst time for BINGE. It follows the loss of a deal that gave it access to first-run BBC content midway through 2024. Its last big content deal is with NBCUniversal, which gives it access to well-known and beloved shows like Law & Order. All eyes in the industry are on that deal, which is believed to be up for renewal later this year.\n\nBINGE will likely lean into its original content, including the acclaimed Australian comedy Colin From Accounts. (Supplied: Joel Pratley)\n\nGoing forward, shows will be acquired on more of a show-by-show basis. This means viewers will likely see a lot more first-run drama from independent productions across North America and Europe. That's not entirely a bad thing and will broaden the types of shows available on streaming \u2014 but rarely are these the loud, buzzy titles that viewers are looking for.\n\nThe big show of the moment on BINGE is The White Lotus. Viewers watching the show on BINGE will continue to see the rest of the new episodes, with the final episode of that show streaming on April 7. The season will continue to be available on BINGE for 30 days after the final episode. But The White Lotus season 3 is non-exclusive and will be available to watch on Max as well.\n\nFans of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver will continue to find the show available on BINGE until the end of the season in November. Unlike The White Lotus, for the moment, that remains exclusive to BINGE.\n\nBINGE does still have original content to lean on \u2014 Colin From Accounts is a sparkling example of how great local comedies can be. This month saw the launch of a new Australian BINGE original, the limited series adaptation of Liane Moriarty's The Last Anniversary. There's also the upcoming UK co-production Mix Tape starring Teresa Palmer, and the ongoing Real Housewives of Sydney.\n\nHe may have won two Emmy Awards last year for his popular talk show, but is John Oliver enough to save Binge? (Supplied: Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images)\n\nIf BINGE was to shut down, that would mean fewer Australian shows going into production and would contribute to the homogeneity of content on our screens. BINGE may not have had the highest volume of original shows, but if it was to go away, its absence would be felt.\n\nIt can't be overstated how great the loss of HBO content is to BINGE. Access to HBO titles has been the selling point BINGE has been defined by since launch. Whether BINGE can retain subscriber interest without it remains to be seen. As entertaining and informative as he is, just having John Oliver may not be enough.",

        "text": "World Athletics president Sebastian Coe has confirmed track and field's governing body has approved the introduction of cheek swabs and dry blood-spot tests for female athletes in order to maintain \"the integrity of competition\".\n\nThe planned changes include reinstating a version of chromosome testing that was discontinued in the 1990s, and require athletes who compete in the female category to submit to a cheek swab or dry blood-spot test for the presence of a gene that indicates whether the athlete has a Y chromosome present in males.\n\nCoe told a news conference that athletes would have to take the test just once during their career.\n\n\"It's important to do it because it maintains everything that we've been talking about, and particularly recently about not just talking about the integrity of female women's sport, but actually guaranteeing it,\" Coe said after a two-day meeting of the World Athletics Council in Nanjing.\n\n\" We feel this is a really important way of providing confidence and maintaining that absolute focus on the integrity of competition. \"\n\nIt is unclear whether the tests will be in place before the world championships in September. Coe said that the new regulations would be drafted and that a testing provider would be confirmed over the next few weeks.\n\nCoe, the two-time Olympic champion who was unsuccessful last week in his bid to become IOC president, has been vocal about \"protecting the female category\" in track and field. He has said the International Olympic Committee needs to take a leadership role in the transgender debate instead of letting each individual sport decide their own regulations.\n\nWorld Athletics president Sebastian Coe wants to maintain \"the integrity of the competition\" in women's events by implementing chromosome testing. (Getty Images: Fabrice Coffrini)\n\nWorld Athletics, which in 2023 banned transgender athletes who had transitioned male to female and gone through male puberty, announced in February proposed recommendations that would apply strict transgender rules to athletes who were born female but had what the organisation described as naturally occurring testosterone levels in the typical male range.\n\nThose recommendations came only days after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order barring transgender athletes from competing in girls sports in the US and pressured the Olympics to do the same. Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Games.\n\nAsked whether World Athletics felt the policy would withstand legal challenges, Coe said he was confident after an exhaustive review.\n\n\"I would never have set off down this path in 2016\u20132017 to protect the female category in sport without being prepared to take the challenge head on,\" Coe said.\n\nHe added: \"We've been to the Court of Arbitration on our DSD (differences in sex development) regulations. They have been upheld, and they have again been upheld after appeal. So we will doggedly protect the female category, and we'll do whatever is necessary to do it.\"\n\nAP",

        "text": "It's widely believed Western Australia is a crucial, potentially decisive battleground in the coming federal election as Labor seeks to retain government.\n\nSo it came as little surprise Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was on multiple Perth radio stations just hours before the government handed down its final budget before the federal election, pushing the message he has the state's best interests at the front of his mind.\n\n\"I'm pro-WA \u2026 and my next visit there will be my 30th as prime minister,\" Mr Albanese told Nine Radio.\n\n\"We support WA jobs, we support WA industry, and that's what we'll continue to do,\" he said.\n\nPromises of tax cuts for all Australians aside, it begs the question \u2014 what's in it for WA?\n\nSoftening live export blow\n\nPhasing out of live sheep exports has been a controversial issue in much of WA, despite the ban being a key Albanese promise.\n\nThe Keep the Sheep campaign was started in response to the federal governments ban on live sheep exports. (ABC Great Southern: Mark Bennett)\n\nThe budget papers show the government is committing $43.5 million over five years \u2014 including $16.3 million in the coming financial year \u2014 aimed at \"fostering wellbeing\" and strengthening community resilience in the sector as part of the support package.\n\nThe budget also includes funding for WA roads in both Perth and the regions.\n\nThe Commonwealth is contributing $350 million to a $700 million project to add a third lane to the Kwinana Freeway in Perth's south.\n\nThe Kwinana Freeway will be widened between Roe Highway and Mortimer Road. (ABC News: Gian De Poloni)\n\nIt will also contribute $90 million to building a grade-separated interchange at Manning Road and Leach Highway.\n\n$14.4 million will be spent this financial year and $37.3 million next year for road infrastructure in the state's north.\n\nIn education, there's an additional $1 million to support the operation of the new Manjali Studio School, a secondary boarding school for First Nations students in the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges area of the Kimberley region.\n\nAs part of its Supporting Social Cohesion initiative, the government will also invest $2 million for upgrades to the education centre of the Holocaust Institute of Western Australia, based in suburban Yokine.\n\nThere's a further $20 million this financial year towards the construction of the Aboriginal Cultural Centre on the banks of the Swan River near the Perth Concert Hall.\n\nThe government has also committed $19.6 million over three years to extend three specialist trauma-informed sexual assault legal services pilots in WA, Victoria and the ACT, and to expand the pilots nationally.\n\nIn WA the program is provided by the Women's Legal Service, Ruah Community Services and the Aboriginal Family Legal Service.\n\nThe Commonwealth will provide $20 million over the next two years towards the Swan Active Ellenbrook facility, being built adjacent to the new Ellenbrook train station.\n\nBudget 'a really cruel hoax'\n\nThe opposition was keen to tell WA voters what it thought of the government's budget, hitting the airwaves to lay into the document.\n\nJane Hume says the opposition's budget reply will have much more to offer struggling Australians. (ABC News: ian cutmore)\n\nShadow Finance Minister Jane Hume said the budget didn't address the real issues people across the country were facing.\n\n\"This budget was clearly aimed not at the next five years but the next five weeks, and the centrepiece of the budget is really a cruel hoax,\" she told ABC Radio Perth.\n\n\"Let's face it, 70 cents a day [in tax cuts] that doesn't kick in for another 15 months is not even going to touch the sides.\"\n\nThe local Chamber of Commerce and Industry's chief economist Aaron Morey also wasn't too impressed.\n\n\"It's not the budget our nation needs. Our nation needs a budget and an economic focus that enhances the incentives for companies to invest in this country,\" he said.\n\nBut he said there were some winners, such as WA electricians.\n\n\"Basically ... electricians can have mutual recognition of their qualifications and licenses across state borders,\" he said.\n\n\"That's a good thing for an economy like WA with skill shortages, it will make it easier for us to attract some of those important trades into WA.\"\n\nLoading...",

        "text": "Labor has introduced its tax cuts to parliament this morning and is attempting to force a swift vote, in a last-minute bid to force the Coalition to promise to repeal the cuts if it wins the upcoming election.\n\nThe opposition went against expectations with its decision to go against the centrepiece of last night's federal budget, which will see the 16 per cent tax rate cut to 15 per cent next year and 14 per cent after that, costing the budget $17.1 billion over the four-year forecast period.\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton has called it a \"hoax\" and signalled he will use his budget reply speech on Thursday night to present an alternative policy.\n\nLabor's proposal would cut the taxes of all taxpayers by up to $268 in the first year and $536 after that \u2013 tax relief Mr Dutton would now need to legislate to wind back should Labor's bill succeed this week.\n\nThat is likely, with the bill having already passed the House of Representatives, and a guillotine motion to force a final vote in the Senate slated for 10pm AEDT. Senator Jacqui Lambie told the ABC she would vote for the tax cuts, leaving the government within striking distance of passage, after Greens leader Adam Bandt said his party would not \"stand in the way\".\n\nThe Coalition voted against the cuts in the House.\n\nLoading...\n\nCoalition derides '70 cents a day' tax cut\n\nMr Dutton told ABC News Breakfast the tax cut was \"just not going to help families today who are really suffering.\"\n\n\"[It's] a 70 cent a day tax cut in 15 months' time... There are a lot of people across the country who are working harder than ever before, and they just know that this government's budget has made it even harder for them to pay their bills,\" he said.\n\nHe foreshadowed a response to come in his Thursday speech in what may be his last chance to address voters before an election is called.\n\n\"Thursday night will be a big night, because we'll make a very significant announcement, and it will be about how we can help Australian families deal with Labor's cost of living crisis,\" he said.\n\nShadow Treasurer Angus Taylor mocked the size of the tax cut on the floor of parliament after the bill was introduced, suggesting the daily amount could only by \"a lollipop... a bread roll if it's on sale... or an entry into a jelly bean guessing competition....\n\n\"Last night we saw handed down by this hopeless treasurer a budget for the next five weeks, not the next five years.\"\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers told News Breakfast the tax cuts were \"modest in isolation, but meaningful when you combine them with the other tax cuts we're providing.\"\n\n\"We're proud of the budget that we handed down last night,\" he said. \"These tax cut top-ups are all about helping people with the cost of living.\"\n\nMr Chalmers called the Coalition's decision to oppose the tax cuts \"a brain explosion\".\n\nLoading...\n\n\"The election is going to be a pretty clear choice, and that choice is crystallising between a Labor government which is cutting taxes to help people with the cost of living, or Peter Dutton who has secret cuts which will make people worse off, not better off...\n\n\"Peter Dutton wants to cut everything, except for people's taxes.\"\n\nBattle of the bottom lines\n\nThe grapple over tax cuts comes as each of the major parties seeks to position itself to voters as the most \"responsible\" steward of the budget.\n\nFiscal responsibility has been central to Labor's pitch in a term dominated by inflation, but which has seen the first two budget surpluses in 15 years, a reduction in gross debt, and a lower rate of cost growth in the spending categories of aged care and the NDIS.\n\nBudget tax cut calculator Photo shows moody image of 50- and 100-dollar notes laid out over bank statements The federal budget includes a \"modest\" tax cut for every taxpayer, starting from next year.\n\nBut its fourth and final budget confirmed budget deficits would return for a decade at least, with no sign that the persistent gap between tax and spending will be closed.\n\nMr Taylor promised last weekend that the Coalition would take a stronger budget bottom line to the election than whatever Labor proposed.\n\nCentral to that pledge will be the Opposition's plan to cut tens of thousands of public service jobs. But it has yet to disclose how much it expects this would save.\n\nLoading...\n\nMeanwhile, it will support most of Labor's largest spending proposals, including the $8.4 billion bulk billing subsidy and the $1.8 billion extension of energy bill relief, and has spending proposals of its own including a $5 billion housing fund.\n\nThat means the fiscal \"envelope\" for any alternative cost of living package is likely to be similar to the $17 billion cost of Labor's tax cuts.\n\nExperts say bigger problems not addressed\n\nBut economists and welfare advocates have bemoaned that this contest over rival tax cuts and pre-election spending neglects bigger-picture challenges facing the budget and the economy.\n\n\"This is a budget that is clearly a pre-election budget,\" Grattan Institute CEO Aruna Sathanapally told the ABC.\n\n\"We've got tax cuts but not tax reform. We've got a boost to primary healthcare spending which is good but not the system reform that we need to see on how we spend. And we've got energy rebates rather than energy efficiency.\"\n\nThe real problem at the heart of this budget isn't a tax cut Photo shows Jim Chalmers budget pic Another budget has come and gone without any real effort to put the nation's finances on a more sustainable footing.\n\nMs Sathanapally said the government had used changes in budget forecasts \"to pay for\u2026 primary care and aged care on the one hand, and on the other these tax cuts, which unfortunately are the easy part.\n\n\"I think a lot of people will welcome this type of reduction in personal income tax in Australia, we lean heavily on personal income tax in Australia relative to other countries similar to us.\n\n\"But what we don't have is the hard bit, which is how we raise tax that's sufficient to pay for the spending we want and that we know is going to happen over the coming years.\"\n\nBudget economist Chris Richardson said the looming tax debate was not \"the right stuff or even terribly sensible. It is not particularly tax reform\u2026\n\n\"We have had a lot of luck as a nation, the tax take has been much bigger than expected but not because of the decisions of the politicians, basically. We've had war, inflation, migration, all things that added to the tax take.\n\nChris Richardson is a leading Australian economist. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine)\n\n\"The risk is that for a quarter of a century we haven't made our spending better, we haven't made our tax [better]\u2026 I doubt that we are match fit for an increasingly volatile world with a range of Trump-shaped risks on the rise.\"\n\nIndependent economist Saul Eslake said the budget failed to address \"the critical issue which has been apparent since before the last election, which is that federal government spending is almost certain to be [higher] over the next 10 years, and in all likelihood beyond then, than the average between 1975 and 2019.\"\n\n\"The Australian public clearly want more spending on health, aged, disability and child care, and any political party which says they can't have it will not get elected to government\u2026 It's difficult to see how spending can be cut sufficiently to offset the increase in spending\u2026\n\nDutton flags details of election pitch to come in budget reply Photo shows Peter Dutton outside. The opposition leader has refused to rule out his own version of the surprise $17 billion tax cuts revealed in Labor's budget last night.\n\n\"Ideally, both sides of politics would, between now and the next election, be having an 'adult conversation' with the electorate as to what would be the least economically damaging, and fairest, ways of raising the additional revenue required to pay for the additional spending\u2026 But there's a greater probability of my spotting a thylacine on my front lawn of a morning than that happening.\"\n\nACOSS chief executive Cassandra Goldie said it was \"astounding\" that the debate focused on tax cuts since they would provide \"more dollars for everybody except people with the least\u2026 [It] would have cost about $4.6 billion to fix it properly and then we would have been able to move beyond the reality that [people on welfare] just do not have enough money, $56 a day.\"\n\nBran Black of the Business Council of Australia said the budget had not done enough \"to grow the size of the pie. Ultimately, if we can invest in productivity enhancing measure, that's how we gain the scope to make further investment.\"",

        "text": "Peter Dutton has flagged he will set up his election pitch to voters when he delivers his budget reply speech on Thursday, refusing to rule out his own version of the surprise tax cuts revealed in Labor's budget.\n\nThe opposition leader gave a few hints to what that election platform would include in his post-budget interview with ABC Radio on Wednesday, outlining his key priorities but declining to give any specifics.\n\nThey included providing support for families struggling with the cost of living, fixing the energy system, cutting back on migration, freeing up housing, providing guarantees around health and education funding, and lastly ensuring Australia's security in a \"very uncertain world\".\n\nHe also branded Labor's tax cuts \u2014 which will be worth about $5 a week to the average worker \u2014 an \"election bribe\" and \"slap in the face\" to households, but would not be drawn on whether his rejection meant the Coalition was planning their own bigger tax package.\n\n\"We'll give our budget reply on Thursday night,\" he said.\n\nHe gave the same answer when questioned about when he would release the specific details of the Coalition's plan to cut waste in the public service.\n\nFederal budget winners and losers The Albanese government has delivered its final budget ahead of an election in May, with a fresh new round of tax cuts the major offer. Find out who else is set to benefit and who may miss out.\n\nThe budget papers revealed the number of public servants has now grown by about 41,000 since the Coalition was in power, with Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor confirming on Tuesday night they would seek to slash those jobs if elected at the next election.\n\nUp until now the Coalition has refused to provide details of how they would get to that goal, but on Wednesday Mr Taylor seemed to give the first hint that it could be achieved through \"attrition\" \u2014 in other words, not through job losses.\n\n\"We know that the public service has got so big now that attrition rates are high and so, let's be clear, that would be what we are relying on,\" he said.\n\nAsked whether attrition alone would be enough to reach their target, Mr Taylor flagged they would have more to say over the coming weeks.\n\n\"We want a public service that delivers for Australians, where people are excited and empowered to work, where bureaucracy doesn't control everything, where people can get on with their jobs and that doesn't need to be a bigger public service,\" he said.\n\nLabor introduces tax cuts legislation\n\nThe $17.1 billion for an income tax cut for every Australian worker was the major surprise of Jim Chalmer's fourth budget as treasurer, which he handed down on Tuesday night.\n\nIn his post-budget media rounds, the treasurer was keen to focus on the measure which he described as \"modest in isolation\" but \"meaningful\" when combined with the other previously announced tax breaks.\n\nThe cuts will start in the middle of next year and would deliver the average wage earner about $268 in annual income tax cuts.\n\nLabor has spent the morning after budget spruiking their new \"modest\" income tax cuts. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\n\"The election is going to be a pretty clear choice,\" Mr Chalmers said.\n\n\"And that choice is crystallising between a Labor government which is cutting taxes to help people with the cost of living, or Peter Dutton who has secret cuts which will make people worse off \u2014 not better off.\"\n\nThe government introduced legislation for the tax cuts to parliament early on Wednesday, in a bid to force the Coalition to promise to repeal the cuts if it wins the election \u2014 which is due on or before May 17.\n\nSpeaking in the House of Representatives, the treasurer declared that \"to stand in the way of this legislation is to vote for higher taxes\".\n\n\"To vote against this legislation would be to stand in the way of more hard-earned money staying in the pockets of every hard-working Australian,\" he said.\n\nAfter two back-to-back budget surpluses, the government has had to sell a $42.1 billion deficit and a bottom line that is expected to remain in the red for the next decade.\n\nBut Prime Minister Anthony Albanese focused instead on the drop in the deficit compared to what was forecast at the last election in 2022.\n\n\"We've already had some almost $100 billion of savings, we've been responsible in the way that we've managed the economy,\" he said.\n\n\"We inherited in that first year a $78 billion deficit that we turned into a $20 billion Labor surplus. We followed that up with another surplus. And in last night's budget we've halved the deficit.\"",

(Truth Social: @realDonaldTrump)\n\nAt some point late Monday or early Tuesday, the portrait, by Colorado Springs artist Sarah Boardman, was removed and placed in storage.\n\nThe plaque that marked the placement of President Trump's portrait, alongside other presidents, is all that remains.\n\nLegislative leaders on both sides of the political divide will now decide how to replace the painting.\n\nBut Joshua Bly, a spokesperson for Colorado Senate Republicans, told the Associated Press it was unknown when this would happen.\n\n\"We have no idea when a new portrait is going to go up, how it\u2019s going to be fundraised, who is going to pay for it, who is going to paint it,\" he said.\n\nHe said it was also unclear whether Mr Trump would be able to approve the replacement.\n\nColorado Republicans raised more than $US10,000 ($15,862) to commission the oil painting, which has hung in the state Capitol since 2019.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nMr Trump also criticised the artist, who has painted portraits of several US presidents, including Barack Obama and George W Bush.\n\n\"The artist also did President Obama, and he looks wonderful, but the one on me is truly the worst,\" he said on Truth Social. \"She must have lost her talent as she got older.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Denver Post in 2019, the artist said it was crucial her subjects looked apolitical.\n\n\"In today's environment it's all very up-front, but in another five, 10, 15 years he will be another president on the wall,\" Ms Boardman said.\n\n\"And he needs to look neutral.\"\n\nFollowing Mr Trump's complaint, Colorado Governor Jared Polis's office issued a statement to multiple outlets.\n\nThe statement said the governor was \"surprised\" the US president was an \"aficionado\" of the Colorado State Capitol and its artwork.\n\n\"We appreciate the president and everyone's interest in our capitol building,\" the statement said.\n\n\" [We] are always looking for any opportunity to improve our visitor experience. \"\n\nABC/AP",

        "text": "\"Work hard today and tomorrow will take care of itself.\"\n\nThat's the mantra new WA Liberal leader Basil Zempilas hopes will help him square up to one of the most unenviable jobs in politics.\n\nBeing opposition leader is hard enough.\n\nRebuilding a party with just six lower house colleagues is even harder.\n\nDoing it as the Liberal leader cranks the difficulty up even higher, for one key reason.\n\nBasil Zempilas and Libby Mettam, his deputy leader, have vowed to work together for the good of the party. (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor)\n\nOver the past two decades they've had 10 state leaders, compared to Labor's five.\n\n\"In opposition, we're not flash,\" retiring upper house MP Peter Collier admitted on his way into the party's caucus yesterday.\n\n\"That's one thing the Labor Party do actually do well, in terms of the fact that they do unify behind the leader.\n\nPeter Collier conceded his party had not been good at getting behind its leaders. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"That's something that we can learn from.\"\n\nZempilas will be hoping his colleagues do, lest he become just another discarded Liberal leader.\n\nWill Basil Zempilas be a lifeline or a liability for the WA Liberals? Photo shows Headshot of Basil Zempilas speaking. Is Basil Zempilas the silver bullet the WA Liberals so desperately need? Even within the party's own ranks, opinions are divided.\n\nWhen asked if he was confident he'd lead the party to the next election it was his \"work hard\" mantra he replied with.\n\nSo let's have a look at what hard work he has ahead over the next 1,445 days to make sure he lasts the distance.\n\nWhat will Zempilas do?\n\nThe first task he has is hashing out an agreement with the Nationals over how they'll work together in opposition.\n\nIn the previous parliament the pair were in an alliance \u2014 because it allowed more independence than a full-blown coalition \u2014 but Zempilas wasn't letting on what the next four years might look like.\n\nFirst, he says, he wants to hear from fellow Liberals about what the arrangement should look like.\n\nBasil Zempilas gave his first press conference as WA Liberal leader on Tuesday. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"My leadership style, for what it's worth, will always be collaborative,\" he said.\n\nNationals leader Shane Love has been similarly coy about how the parties should be partnered.\n\n\"I firmly believe a strong, unified approach is essential to holding the Labor government to account,\" was as far as he would go in a statement yesterday.\n\nOnce that partnership is worked out, Zempilas and Love can start dishing out shadow portfolios to really get their teams to work.\n\nNewly minted MP Basil Zempilas voted in unopposed as WA Liberal leader Photo shows A close-up of Basil Zempilas wearing a suit. After winning his seat by an extremely thin margin, newly minted Churchlands MP Basil Zempilas is voted in by his party colleagues as leader of the WA Liberals.\n\n\"That is a matter of urgency, but it is not such urgency that it needs to happen in the next couple of days,\" Zempilas said.\n\n'Raise the standards'\n\nThen comes the hard work of being a \"constructive opposition\", as Zempilas wants to be, including by improving the standard of parliamentary debate.\n\n\"Raise the standards, raise the tone,\" he said.\n\nHe also listed a number of \"hallmarks\" including: \"fairness\" especially for \"those who need a helping hand\"; \"integrity\"; \"excellence\" and \"common sense\".\n\nAll the while leading a \"reset\" of his party.\n\nSome policies taken to the election could be shelved: \"Many of those had great merit, but everything is now up for discussion.\"\n\nOne already ditched is Mettam's controversial pledge to not stand in front of the Aboriginal flag if elected Premier.\n\nBasil Zempilas says he will be happy to stand in front of the Aboriginal flag at press conferences, unlike his predecessor Libby Mettam. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"I'm happy to stand in front of the Aboriginal flag anywhere, anytime,\" was Zempilas's answer.\n\nBut opposing \"wasteful government spending\", particularly plans for a racetrack at Burswood Park, would likely survive.\n\nWhat are the Liberals saying?\n\nBeyond that though, \"listening\" will be the key \u2014 mentioned 11 times by Zempilas.\n\n\"Listening is what is going to give us the answers to those questions,\" he said.\n\nVeteran upper house MP Steve Thomas agreed that was the right approach.\n\n\"We need to reach out to the people differently, we need to develop policies in a more robust manner and we need to communicate what we're trying to do better,\" he said.\n\nSteve Thomas backed Basil Zempilas's call for a different approach for the Liberal Party. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nHis hope is Zempilas, as a recently anointed Liberal, is the right man for the job.\n\n\"Someone that doesn't come with all of the history of the Liberal Party and can look at it and go, we need to do it differently and we certainly need to do it better,\" Dr Thomas said.\n\n'People will see what I'm about'\n\nOn top of listening to key players across the state, Zempilas will also be learning how to listen to his electorate as a first-term MP alongside his other newbie colleagues.\n\n\"We're not all politicians, we're parliamentarians, and we have a responsibility to represent the places that elected us,\" Kalamunda MP Adam Hort acknowledged as he arrived after just scraping over the line.\n\nAdam Hort had to wait until Monday before being confirmed as the winner in Kalamunda. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nFor Zempilas, that responsibility is to the people of Churchlands \u2014 a seat he won by just 636 votes.\n\nThat narrow margin has raised concerns among some Liberals that he doesn't have wide appeal across the community the party had hoped for.\n\n\"I'm confident that as I get to work with my team, people will see what I'm about, what I plan to bring to this space,\" Zempilas said.\n\nMr Zempilas says his leadership ushers in a \"reset\" for the Liberal party. (ABC News: Herlyn Kaur )\n\n\"The vigour, the energy, the professionalism, the fight for the people every single day.\"\n\nHard work key for Zempilas\n\nAsked how he planned to counter the suggestion he wasn't popular among women, Zempilas had a similar answer.\n\n\"Work hard, be myself, do what I've come here for and that is to work hard every day for the people of Churchlands and work hard every day for the people of Western Australia,\" he said.\n\nZempilas's capacity for hard work is pretty well beyond question after years of juggling a busy media schedule across radio, TV and print as well as being Lord Mayor for a period.\n\nMr Zempilas says the Liberal Party will listen to the community more. (ABC News: Jake Sturmer)\n\nHis test will be uniting a notoriously difficult partyroom and keeping them focused on their next big test in 2029.\n\nIt's a mammoth one, made harder by a worse-than-expected result at this election.\n\nBut maybe 1,445 days of hard work will be enough for the result to take care of itself.",

        "text": "The Western Bulldogs are still holding out hope Jamarra Ugle-Hagan will remain at the club beyond this season, even as it remains unclear when he will play another game.\n\nUgle-Hagan is yet to play this season and has trained sparingly with the Bulldogs as he deals with off-field issues. He has found himself in the headlines this week after opting to not attend Bulldogs games.\n\nThe 22-year-old, who was the first overall pick in the 2020 draft, is contracted through the 2026 season and played 67 games for the Bulldogs through his first four seasons at the AFL level.\n\n\"There is a lot of unknowns and it only sort of crystallises at the end of the year,\" Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge told Nine's Footy Classified.\n\n\"At this point in time obviously there's a lot of media conjecture and reports that clubs are interested, and that happens. Ultimately, no one is sure of that until 'Marra's management comes to you and says, 'Hey, this is what he'd like to happen'.\n\n\"We're passionate about him, we've cared for him for a long time. There is a bit of a frustration, but we're understanding what he's going through.\n\n\"We'd love for him to re-engage, we'd love him to be a part of our football club and we'd love to see more of those performances in the future and so we hold out a lot of hope.\"\n\nBeveridge described the expectation around Ugle-Hagan's movements as \"rubbery\" and admitted he often receives calls and texts from people who have spotted the Bulldogs forward out in public.\n\n\"It's a long series of events away from the club that people have become privy to,\" he said.\n\n\"The challenging thing in today's society, especially when you live a public life like Jamarra does, is everyone knows where you are. Whether it's on socials or it's (someone) texting me or ringing me after they've located him somewhere.\n\n\"The expectation around his movement into the future is a bit rubbery.\n\n\"He'll train at the club here and there. There will be times where he is absolutely not expected to be in different places and it'll be his choice. We're working with him on that and sometimes it's a tolerance to it.\"\n\nBeveridge hinted at immaturity being a factor behind Ugle-Hagan's absence from the team so far this season.\n\n\"We talk about the character and the integrity of the person and how they may be a little bit immature and it might take some time,\" he said.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"I reflect on how I was as an 18-year-old, I was very immature compared to some others my age, and 'Marra is no different and it may take him a little bit more time.\n\n\"I definitely won't be making any decisions. What will happen is it will be a group think and ultimately, similar to what's happened with one or two players in the past, it's what's best for the player and ultimately what's best for our football club as we move into the future.\"\n\nUgle-Hagan is considered to be one of the best young forward prospects in the AFL and has earned comparisons to legendary former Hawks and Swans forward, Lance Franklin.\n\nLance Franklin is no stranger to being in the spotlight as a youngster after the early part of his career with Hawthorn. (Getty Images: Lucas Dawson)\n\nFranklin, like Ugle-Hagan, found himself constantly in the headlines during his rise to stardom with Hawthorn in the mid-2000s, and urged the Bulldog to find himself a solid support network.\n\n\"You have got to have good people around you,\" he said.\n\n\"[Having] people that can pull you into line when you need to be, but also just being there for you when you are playing good, or playing poorly, or whatever is happening in your life \u2013 I think that is the biggest learning I have taken out of your career.\n\n\"It just comes back to that enjoyment factor. If you love what you do, and you are passionate about it, then obviously you want to stay in the game as long as possible.\n\n\"For any young kids, it\u2019s just building those relationships and building trust within the club and the people that are there and having those conversations.\"",

Although he performed at the Gala in 2023, McGregor hasn\u2019t done a full-length show in eight years. In 2017, he was single, living in Melbourne and riddled with anxiety. For his new show, he\u2019s married, living in Newcastle, and well, still anxious but better at covering it. Wagyu steak with fries and Parisian butter at Lucia Credit: Penny Stephens \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much about everything that\u2019s happened in the last eight years, but I used to do a show where I\u2019d talk about how I\u2019m anxious and nervous, and now I\u2019m still that, but I\u2019ve also got children, right? And so children are like, \u2018how do you solve this issue?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t figured out myself yet\u2019. So you have to fake it or make something up.\u201d You might think someone with McGregor\u2019s disposition might have chosen a career further from the spotlight, like an economist or something. He thought that, too, getting a degree in economics and planning a life as a policy wonk, until a drink too many at a comedy gig changed his life.\n\nThe lobster \u201ctaco\u201d at Lucia. Credit: Penny Stephens \u201cOne of my friends was doing comedy, one of my housemates, and I went to the gig to watch him, and someone didn\u2019t show up. I was a bit tipsy, so I got up as well. I loved it and just never stopped doing it,\u201d he says. He had prepared nothing, so he was addressing a room full of strangers entirely off the cuff. Did it go well? He shakes his head, very sure on this point. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cFor the first minute and a half, I was just saying things like, you guys might want to put in your drinks because you are going to spill them all over yourself, I\u2019m very funny, and the crowd went with it. Then I had no jokes and I bombed. But the little bit that went well was enough to get me hooked.\u201d It took a long time to make it his full-time career, but he knew right then that this was what he wanted to do with his life. \u201cIn that moment, that was the first time where I felt like coming home or something. It felt like, \u2018oh, this is me. This feels like unfiltered. This feels like 100 per cent me\u2019.\u201d The early years were hard, playing to tiny rooms and doing his own flyering. \u201cI used to do a double act with a friend from Tassie, and we\u2019d have, like, two people there. And then when I did Edinburgh, I had, like, four people, seven people, in an 80-seater venue,\u201d he says. But those two, four or seven people liked what they saw. He won the coveted Best Newcomer Award for his first full-length show at MICF in 2013, and he started playing to bigger rooms. \u201cI was moving to bigger venues, quicker than I was ready. At first, I was worried no one would show up, and then I was worried people would show up.\u201d\n\nHe landed the role of Hugh on the first two seasons of Utopia, where he became close with Pacquola. Their show Rosehaven turned out to be a hit for the ABC and ran for five seasons, by which time \u201cwe had run out of real estate storylines\u201d, McGregor says. \u201cWe always had enough ideas for one-and-a-half seasons, and by the time we got to the fifth, we were on the cusp of running out of ideas. And then we just didn\u2019t have enough for a sixth. It would have been a strain and would have been the first time we went into writing without having a full idea in our heads.\u201d That\u2019s not to say McGregor\u2019s collaboration with Pacquola is finished, with the pair working on a new project he\u2019s cagey about telling me too much about. \u201cWe want to write something where more things can happen,\u201d he says, somewhat mysteriously. \u201cRosehaven was very small stakes... I reckon we\u2019ll work together on stuff forever, we\u2019re always doing something. And plus, we\u2019re besties, we\u2019re hanging out anyway.\u201d Luke McGregor on stage at the 2017 Melbourne International Comedy Festival Gala.

I had read an interview with McGregor a decade ago where he revealed his comedic hero was American Dave Chappelle, so I ask him: how does famously conflict-averse McGregor now feel about Chappelle, who came under fire for jokes about transgender people in his 2021 Netflix special The Closer, then doubled down in his 2023 special The Dreamer? McGregor\u2019s wife is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns. It has been an extremely pleasant interview thus far, but it is clear McGregor does not like this question. He pauses to consider his answer. \u201cI don\u2019t gel as much with his new stuff, he says, slowly. \u201cI haven\u2019t kept up with him. So I don\u2019t know. I know there was controversy around his last special, but I haven\u2019t kept up to date.\u201d\n\nI press the matter. Are there jokes or topics or subjects comics just shouldn\u2019t touch? \u201cI\u2019m a straight, white man, so I have all the privilege, and I don\u2019t like commenting on people who aren\u2019t other straight, white men. I just don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my place to say,\u201d he says. But he goes on: \u201cI think trans rights are really important. I think we have got to protect those, and I don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening in America right now. I think if comedy doesn\u2019t elevate groups that need help or that are getting persecuted in some way, then what are we doing?\u201d He says while he loves watching comedians like Jon Stewart and John Oliver overseas, and Tom Ballard here, that kind of comedy is not his chosen medium for standup. But he then quotes American YouTuber Philip DeFranco: \u201cYou may not F-word with politics, but politics F-words with you\u201d (this is an exact transcript, McGregor is no foul-mouthed comedian). \u201cWe\u2019ve all got skin in the game,\u201d he says. Celia Pacquola and Luke McGregor write and star in Rosehaven. Credit: ABC For McGregor, that skin in the game has to result in a shared empathy and compassion. \u201cI think part of our job as good citizens is that we have to think about issues that don\u2019t affect us, like aged care, like trans rights, like childcare. You might not be affected by it, but without people thinking about it outside of their own experience, those issues don\u2019t get fixed.\u201d In full flow, he explains the duty a government has to its citizens, and that we have to each other. And even though we are talking politics, which can be tricky ground for a comedian or public figure of any kind, he does not seem nervous at all.",

But a lot of questions remained about how Labor\u2019s proposal would work, he said.\n\n\u201cGiven it\u2019s a very complex area of employment law, it\u2019s unclear whether these changes would apply to non-disclosure agreements, for instance. So we need answers to those questions,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nThe Council of Small Business Organisations Australia earlier told the ABC last night\u2019s federal budget was one of the worst for small business, and the council was shocked and disappointed by the non-compete clause.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t actually understand what\u2019s being proposed here yet ... [the council] may or may not,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cThe thing about the Labor Party is they\u2019re more likely to brief other people than us. That\u2019s how they work. They don\u2019t seem to believe in democracy the way I do. So we haven\u2019t been briefed on the detail of it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who knows that the detail of these things really counts. We want people to have options in the labour market, but we also want small business to be strong.\u201d\n\nUnder Labor\u2019s proposal, Australian workers will be free to change jobs for a pay rise more easily.\n\nBusinesses will be barred from forcing non-compete clauses on staff earning less than $175,000, which represents about four in five workers, after the contracts spread from industries such as the law to low-paid jobs such as hairdressing, where they delay job switches by months or years.",

Measures that were opposed by the Opposition. They want to cut everything: cut your education, cut your health. The only thing they don\u2019t want to cut is your taxes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition Treasurer Angus Taylor says the Coalition will not support the government's tax cuts, labelling them an \"election night bribe\" that will do little to address Australians' falling standard of living.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Taylor did not rule out the Coalition introducing tax cuts of its own, as Opposition leader Peter Dutton is expected to deliver his budget reply speech tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead he said his party's economic blueprint would focus on cost of living measures and national security.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Taylor says the government's budget would fail to relieve prices pressures for struggling families.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No pathway back to the stand of living we had.

It was, I guess, from what I understand, took place during that it wasn't classified information. So this was not less of a now it's classified information. It's probably a little bit different. But I always say you get you have to learn from every experience. I think it was very unfair the way they attacked Michael. He's a good person.

The average earner will have an extra $536 in their pocket each year when they're fully implemented.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan is expected to cost the government $17 billion over the next three years.\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\nThe government is to continue its military support for Ukraine, with $17 million allocated in the Federal Budget over two years for military aid.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe money is to go towards communication systems, artillery components, and firearms to assist in Ukraine\u2019s defence against the Russian invasion.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has committed more than $1.5 billion to Ukraine since the Russian ground invasion in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has already committed to return an Australian Embassy to Kyiv.\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\nDemocrats are calling on top officials to resign over an incident in which a magazine journalist was accidentally included in a secret group chat containing highly sensitive war plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and C-I-A Director John Ratcliffe \u2013 both of whom were in the chat \u2013 on Tuesday [[25 March]] testified before a Senate committee that no classified material was shared through the encrypted messaging app.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Democratic senators have rejected that claim, with the journalist reporting that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted operational details about pending strikes against Yemen's Houthis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incident has triggered outrage among national security experts and prompted Democrats \u2013 and some of Trump's fellow Republicans \u2013 who are calling for an investigation into what appears to be a major security breach.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong them is Democratic Senator from Virginia, Mark Warner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system, it's also just mind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line and nobody bothered to even check. Security hygiene 101, who are all the names? Who are they? Well, it apparently included a journalist. This was not only sloppy; it not only violated all procedures, but if this information had gotten out, American lives could have been lost.\"\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\nAustralia has taken another step towards qualifying for the 2026 World Cup with a 2-nil victory over China in Hangzhou.\n\n\n\n\n\nTony Popovic's side made it six points out of six in the current window with victory over China.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis - as first-half goals from Jackson Irvine and Nishan Velupillay gave the Socceroos a lead, following their 5-1 win against Indonesia last week.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has allocated a further $178 million over five years for what it calls social cohesion measures in its 2025 federal budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's further support for security at both Jewish and Muslim places of worship, and African and Chinese communities will also receive some funding to restore museums and other programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nTen million dollars is to be provided for independent multicultural media outlets, and two million dollars for the Holocaust Institute of Western Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia, or FECCA, welcomes the new funding.\n\n\n\n\n\nFECCA's Chair, Peter Doukas, says it's a timely reminder of how diverse our society is, and the need to work with that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, social cohesion and multiculturalism is central to our way of life in Australia. More than half the people in this country have at least one parent born overseas. And we think that it is becoming a more central part of governing Australia. So, much more investment in multiculturalism and social cohesion is what we would expect, more broadly. But we do welcome this announcement as part of this budget.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Doukas says with the federal election so close, FECCA expects more policy announcements in this broad area soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government is also allocating $3.5 million to embed the Community Refugee Integration and Settlement Program which aims to support refugees arriving in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the election looming, FECCA does see some dark clouds on the horizon, though.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Doukas says there's more room for further investment when it comes to things like reforming the overseas skills and qualifications recognition system.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he says he's worried about the politicisation of some aspects of immigration, particularly with the current state of the housing market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, I am concerned. And we have already made representations to both sides about it. We are hopeful that it doesn't occur. But we will continue to remind the major political players that Australia is the most successful multicultural society in the world. And we all have the stewardship of that in our hands as part of this campaign, and more broadly. So, I am hoping for the best.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe budget contains more than half a billion dollars in funding for better outcomes for First Nations people under the National Closing The Gap agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's boosted funding for First Nations businesses, easing cost of living pressure in remote communities, and improving health outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSNAICC is the biggest national non-governmental body advocating for Indigenous children.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Executive Catherine Liddle says the funding for early education and care in this budget is especially promising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you are drilling the uglier side of things, you'll see that children who have had access to early education and care, and families who have had access to those services, are far less likely to come into contact with tertiary interventions, which are things like child protection and youth justice systems. And, again, that means, if we are investing at the right time, we are also seeing an improvement in community safety.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Ms Liddle says the government has missed an opportunity by not committing more funding for the Safe and Supported program, designed to help children and families stay together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we know is that one of the most horrific statistics in the Closing The Gap targets is that statistic that relates to the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care. That target is increasing at a rate that can only be called a national disgrace. And what we haven't seen is any commitment into the investment for that plan. Because that is the plan that works alongside communities to develop the programs and the responses that communities need to keep their families strong, to keep their children safe, and to ensure that no one is removed from their families.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also a crucial budget for Australians with a disability.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine McAlpine, from Inclusion Australia, says the best part of this budget is the reform of the Information, Linkages, and Capacity-Building program, which funds projects aimed at building connection between Australians with disability and their communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also welcomes more funding for apprentices with disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the main downside of this budget comes in the decreased funding for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, or the NDIS, as a result of expected slowdown in its growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs McAlpine says politicians need to be wary of the downstream effects of reduced NDIS funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think it's that easy for politicians to cut the NDIS when they know how many people rely on it, and the marginalisation of the people who rely on it. I do think that there's a rush to bank the savings without making sure that the supports that people need in the community are in place. So, it feels like there is a really fast move towards: oh yes, we're down to the eight per cent growth... without saying: have people got the right supports in place? If there are people who are not getting on the scheme, are they able to get supports into the community as promised by national cabinet? Or, are we doing this whole process too fast?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne area set to benefit many disabled Australians is the nearly one billion dollars in additional money allocated to stop family violence.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs McAlpine welcomes the funding, but says special provision should be made so that disabled Australians are able to access these services.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What Labor is offering is an election bribe, as part of a big spending, big taxing, big election budget.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition's Treasury spokesman has slammed the government's economic outlook.\n\n\n\n\n\nAngus Taylor describes the government's $17 billion tax cuts for all Australians over the next three years as a 'cruel hoax for the Australian people'.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a sentiment shared by others, with Greens leader Adam Bandt describing the tax cuts - a key budget measure - as a 'tiny tax tweak'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"An extra 73 cents a day in 15 months' time won't help much when your rent has already gone up by hundreds of dollars while everyday people are being made to wait over a year to get a very small amount of extra tax cuts. Billionaires and big corporations are rolling in it right now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers have been critical of the government's key budget pledge - particularly its failure to include any increase to JobSeeker payments which has remained at $56 a day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Council of Social Service's Cassandra Goldie says people experiencing poverty have pleaded with the government for years to improve social security payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The centrepiece of the budget tonight is a promise of more tax cuts, which will go right up the income scale to help people on the very highest incomes in the country, and at the same time, we have nothing to help people with the very least.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCriticism of the government's economic measures also extend to its decision to scrap non-compete clauses for most Australian workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe measure means more than three million workers - including those in childcare, construction and hairdressing - will no longer be prevented from switching to better, higher-paying jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut some are concerned about the effect of that on Australian businesses, as Australian Industry Group Chief Executive Innes Willox explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australian businesses, large and small, spend a tremendous amount of resources, hiring, engaging, training, and building up their staff, and to now risk having lost that and losing all the intellectual property that has been built up, is going to be a huge concern for Australian business. And we suspect that if this measure does go ahead, we will see an enormous amount of litigation, legal action, around around this measure.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it isn't all bad news.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the budget didn't offer any additions when it comes to childcare reform, advocates in the sector welcome the government's progress towards a universal childcare system, including three days of subsidised early childhood education.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgie Dent from The Parenthood described it as an historic investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that when children have access to high quality early education and care, they do much better over the course of their lives. We believe that every child should be entitled to this opportunity. The federal government has made a commitment to ultimately building out a universal, high quality, early education and care system that is simple and affordable for families.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in the aged care sector also welcomed the $2.6 billion investment in further pay rises for aged care nurses - but are disappointed by an absence of investments to adapt to the new aged care act.\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Symondson is CEO of Ageing Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we unfortunately did not see tonight is an investment in supporting the transition to our new Aged Care Act. We had called for investments in digital readiness, in making sure that our providers are ready to implement the new act on 1 July, and we'd also called for assistance to prepare themselves to take on huge numbers of new older people who are going to need care.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung people also feel as though they are missing out - especially when it comes to less funding for youth allowance and a lack of cost of living relief.\n\n\n\n\n\nAshlyn Horden is the President of the National Union of Students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So if the government really wants to see 80 per cent of Australians have a tertiary qualification by 2050 they need to be thinking about the students who are currently having to think about their grumbling stomachs over their studies, the students who are lining up in what are essentially 21st century bread lines for food banks because they can't afford to feed themselves.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing that came as little surprise was the government's ongoing commitment to health investment, with $8.9 billion towards Medicare a key feature of the budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Ramya Raman is Vice President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says while she welcomes the measures for training GPS and further investment in women's health, there are questions around the government's expectation for 90 per cent of appointments to be bulk-billed.\n\n\n\n",

This will take the first tax rate down to its lowest level in more than half a century.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor will reduce the tax rate on earnings between $18,201 and $45,000 from 16 per cent to 15 per cent this year, then to 14 per cent the year after.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt means anyone earning more than $45,000 a year will take home an extra $268 annually from July 1st, and $536 more each year after.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt builds on previously-announced cost of living measures, including:\n\n\n\n\n\nExtended energy bill relief for every household.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn $8.5 billion boost to bulk billing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd slashing the cost of medications on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme [[P-B-S]].\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We\u2019ve come a long way together, but there is more work to do. This Budget is our plan for a new generation of prosperity in a new world of uncertainty. It\u2019s a plan to help finish the fight against inflation, rebuild living standards, and maximise our national advantages into the future.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd a pitch to improve productivity - banning non-compete clauses that prevent employees from moving between competing businesses - a move that would apply to most workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are holding too many Australian workers back from going to better paid opportunities or setting up small businesses. They make no sense. They have millions of Australians tied up in this unnecessary red tape preventing them from earning more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe economy is starting to settle.\n\n\n\n\n\nInflation is expected to fall to 2.5 per cent this year, with wages expected to grow by 3 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut spending will keep the budget in the red zone for the next decade, with a 27 billion-dollar deficit this financial year.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Chalmers says it's not that bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our deficit this year has almost halved since we came to office. Next year\u2019s deficit is $42 billion, lower than what was forecast at the last election, and lower than at the mid-year update. Gross debt will hit $940 billion this financial year, $177 billion less than what we inherited.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Treasurer says it\u2019s an uncertain economic time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got a war in Eastern Europe. We've got a collapsing cease fire in the Middle East. And so all of this is creating the sorts of global economic conditions which make it even more remarkable what the Australian people are achieving in our own economy here at home. Now this global economic uncertainty is not as episodic as we may have become accustomed to in earlier generations. Just in the 2020s we've already had the global pandemic, the global inflation spike which followed it, and now the threat of a global trade war.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut despite big talk, not much to Trump-proof the budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust $20 million to promote Australian made products.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd no new money for aid, despite the cuts from the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, moving $120 million global aid programs to the Indo-Pacific region next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nJim Chalmers says the government is doing what it can.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well we're already stepping up, I guess is the point that I'm making, but we need to do that within the context of our other budget constraints and our other priorities.\"\n\n\n\n",

Credit: Penny Stephens \u201cOne of my friends was doing comedy, one of my housemates, and I went to the gig to watch him, and someone didn\u2019t show up. I was a bit tipsy, so I got up as well. I loved it and just never stopped doing it,\u201d he says. He had prepared nothing, so he was addressing a room full of strangers entirely off the cuff. Did it go well? He shakes his head, very sure on this point. \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cFor the first minute and a half, I was just saying things like, you guys might want to put in your drinks because you are going to spill them all over yourself, I\u2019m very funny, and the crowd went with it. Then I had no jokes and I bombed. But the little bit that went well was enough to get me hooked.\u201d It took a long time to make it his full-time career, but he knew right then that this was what he wanted to do with his life. \u201cIn that moment, that was the first time where I felt like coming home or something. It felt like, \u2018oh, this is me. This feels like unfiltered. This feels like 100 per cent me\u2019.\u201d The early years were hard, playing to tiny rooms and doing his own flyering. \u201cI used to do a double act with a friend from Tassie, and we\u2019d have, like, two people there. And then when I did Edinburgh, I had, like, four people, seven people, in an 80-seater venue,\u201d he says. But those two, four or seven people liked what they saw. He won the coveted Best Newcomer Award for his first full-length show at MICF in 2013, and he started playing to bigger rooms. \u201cI was moving to bigger venues, quicker than I was ready. At first, I was worried no one would show up, and then I was worried people would show up.\u201d\n\nHe landed the role of Hugh on the first two seasons of Utopia, where he became close with Pacquola. Their show Rosehaven turned out to be a hit for the ABC and ran for five seasons, by which time \u201cwe had run out of real estate storylines\u201d, McGregor says. \u201cWe always had enough ideas for one-and-a-half seasons, and by the time we got to the fifth, we were on the cusp of running out of ideas. And then we just didn\u2019t have enough for a sixth. It would have been a strain and would have been the first time we went into writing without having a full idea in our heads.\u201d That\u2019s not to say McGregor\u2019s collaboration with Pacquola is finished, with the pair working on a new project he\u2019s cagey about telling me too much about. \u201cWe want to write something where more things can happen,\u201d he says, somewhat mysteriously. \u201cRosehaven was very small stakes... I reckon we\u2019ll work together on stuff forever, we\u2019re always doing something. And plus, we\u2019re besties, we\u2019re hanging out anyway.\u201d Luke McGregor on stage at the 2017 Melbourne International Comedy Festival Gala. Credit: Jim Lee He nominates Pacquola, of course, as one of his favourite comedians, alongside Ronny Chieng, Aaron Chen, Sam Campbell, Nazeem Hussain and Anne Edmonds. I had read an interview with McGregor a decade ago where he revealed his comedic hero was American Dave Chappelle, so I ask him: how does famously conflict-averse McGregor now feel about Chappelle, who came under fire for jokes about transgender people in his 2021 Netflix special The Closer, then doubled down in his 2023 special The Dreamer? McGregor\u2019s wife is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns. It has been an extremely pleasant interview thus far, but it is clear McGregor does not like this question. He pauses to consider his answer. \u201cI don\u2019t gel as much with his new stuff, he says, slowly. \u201cI haven\u2019t kept up with him. So I don\u2019t know. I know there was controversy around his last special, but I haven\u2019t kept up to date.\u201d\n\nI press the matter. Are there jokes or topics or subjects comics just shouldn\u2019t touch? \u201cI\u2019m a straight, white man, so I have all the privilege, and I don\u2019t like commenting on people who aren\u2019t other straight, white men. I just don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s my place to say,\u201d he says. But he goes on: \u201cI think trans rights are really important. I think we have got to protect those, and I don\u2019t like what\u2019s happening in America right now. I think if comedy doesn\u2019t elevate groups that need help or that are getting persecuted in some way, then what are we doing?\u201d He says while he loves watching comedians like Jon Stewart and John Oliver overseas, and Tom Ballard here, that kind of comedy is not his chosen medium for standup. But he then quotes American YouTuber Philip DeFranco: \u201cYou may not F-word with politics, but politics F-words with you\u201d (this is an exact transcript, McGregor is no foul-mouthed comedian). \u201cWe\u2019ve all got skin in the game,\u201d he says. Celia Pacquola and Luke McGregor write and star in Rosehaven. Credit: ABC For McGregor, that skin in the game has to result in a shared empathy and compassion. \u201cI think part of our job as good citizens is that we have to think about issues that don\u2019t affect us, like aged care, like trans rights, like childcare. You might not be affected by it, but without people thinking about it outside of their own experience, those issues don\u2019t get fixed.\u201d In full flow, he explains the duty a government has to its citizens, and that we have to each other. And even though we are talking politics, which can be tricky ground for a comedian or public figure of any kind, he does not seem nervous at all.",

        "text": "Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor says the Coalition is yet to understand the details of a Labor proposal to ban non-compete agreements, which prevent staff defecting to other employers or starting their own business.\n\nSpeaking on ABC Radio National earlier this morning, Taylor said he supported free labour markets where people could move easily between jobs. But a lot of questions remained about how Labor\u2019s proposal would work, he said.\n\n\u201cGiven it\u2019s a very complex area of employment law, it\u2019s unclear whether these changes would apply to non-disclosure agreements, for instance. So we need answers to those questions,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nThe Council of Small Business Organisations Australia earlier told the ABC last night\u2019s federal budget was one of the worst for small business, and the council was shocked and disappointed by the non-compete clause.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t actually understand what\u2019s being proposed here yet ... [the council] may or may not,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cThe thing about the Labor Party is they\u2019re more likely to brief other people than us. That\u2019s how they work. They don\u2019t seem to believe in democracy the way I do. So we haven\u2019t been briefed on the detail of it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m someone who knows that the detail of these things really counts. We want people to have options in the labour market, but we also want small business to be strong.\u201d\n\nUnder Labor\u2019s proposal, Australian workers will be free to change jobs for a pay rise more easily.\n\nBusinesses will be barred from forcing non-compete clauses on staff earning less than $175,000, which represents about four in five workers, after the contracts spread from industries such as the law to low-paid jobs such as hairdressing, where they delay job switches by months or years.",
