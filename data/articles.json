(Getty)\n\n\"Close social interactions, shared accommodation, and sometimes risky behaviours create the perfect storm for disease transmission.\n\n\"Simple measures like vaccination, good hygiene, and safe food practices can make a huge difference in safeguarding against the risks.\"\n\nThe review also revealed that outbreaks were often detected through routine surveillance or on-site medical teams, underscoring the need for strong health systems and rapid response capabilities.\n\nMeningococcal outbreaks have been detected at youth festivals. (Nine)\n\nRecommendations included setting up on-site clinics, ensuring surge capacity in local hospitals, and implementing clear communication protocols for emergencies.\n\nPublic health researcher and co-author Dr Josh Trigg said festival-goers themselves play a vital role in staying safe.\n\n\"If you're heading to a multi-day event, check your vaccinations, wash your hands regularly, and be mindful about what you eat and drink,\" he said.\n\n\"Public health isn't just about big systems - it's about individual choices that protect you and the people around you.\"\n\nWhile organisers needed to enforce strict hygiene protocols for food providers and handlers, with past outbreaks of disease being traced to contaminated coleslaw, undercooked meat, and even food workers battling infections.\n\n\"Festivals are a highlight of the year for many young people,\" Trigg said.\n\n\"By planning ahead and following simple precautions, we can keep them safe, fun, and memorable.\"",

This file photo is from last month. (SIPA via CNN)\n\n\"I'm sorry the city allowed something like this, because it affects Luciano's image and the respect he deserves,\" she told the newspaper Il Resto del Carlino last week.\n\n\"It's just not right.\"\n\nPesaro's mayor, Andrea Biancani, came under fire after posting a doctored image of the famous tenor skating, complete with a hockey stick, on Facebook on November 23.\n\nIn the post, he suggested that skaters #daiUnCinqueAPavarotti\" or to \"high-five\" the statue.\n\n\"The smile, the humour, the ability to see the bright side of things. Let's never lose it,\" he wrote on the post after Mantovani first complained.\n\nBiancani explained that the city decided to inaugurate the rink to kick off the holiday season as planned despite the bad tone.\n\nThe mayor's post, which is still online, garnered several critical comments, with concerns about safety, should people try and high-five the statue, as well as concerns about poor taste.\n\n'No intention of disrespect'\n\nBiancani has now formally apologised to Mantovani and a spokesman for the city hall told CNN that it was not their intention to offend the singer's family or his legacy.\n\nThe spokesman said that the installers mistakenly built the rink around the statue, instead of next to it.\n\n\"There was no intention of disrespect,\" the spokesman told CNN on behalf of the mayor.\n\nHe added that the presence of Pavarotti embedded in the ice was not part of the original plan for the Christmas rink.\n\n\"I was assured that Pavarotti wouldn't be touched or incorporated into the ice rink floor,\" he told local media.\n\nWhile officials say it isn't possible to dismantle the rink or move the statue at this stage, they have built a short wall around it, separating it from the rest of the rink.\n\nHowever, skaters can still touch the monument if they pass close to the edge.\n\nThe Pavarotti statue was inaugurated in April 2024 to honour the late singer and his wife who had a holiday home on the Adriatic Coast nearby.\n\nPavarotti is considered one of the greatest tenors of all time and sold more than 100 million records worldwide.\n\nHis collaboration with Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras as The Three Tenors produced the biggest-selling classical album in history.",

(Getty)\n\nApps need to take \"reasonable steps\ufeff\" to ensure no child aged under 16 can create or use an account, or the companies will be liable for a fine of up to $49.5 million.\n\nThe list of age-restricted social media platforms \ufeffcould grow as the ban evolves too.\n\nSocial media companies have started to roll out features which will deactivate or remove the accounts of anyone aged under 16, and to stop new accounts being made by children.\n\nHowever, with the ban just days away, Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said it was \"disappointing\" that some platforms have waited to the last minute to alert users.\n\n\"We suggested the best timeframe was two weeks in advance. My powers don't come into effect until December 10, and that's when we'll start gathering information notices,\" she said.\n\n\"We've been working on compliance plans. We've been engaging. We've been telling companies what best practice is.\n\n\"We've been talking to them for over a year.\n\n\"So this should be a surprise to none of them, but there's nothing I can do, from a regulatory perspective, to light a fire under them, only that this is the right thing to do to their young users that are going to use the platform.\"\ufeff\n\nApps need to take \"reasonable steps\ufeff\" to ensure no child aged under 16 can create or use an account. (Getty)\n\nMeta (Facebook, Instagram, Threads)\ufeff\n\nMeta, which owns Instagram, Facebook and Threads, started alerting users with a birthdate which ages them under 16 or are identifiable as under 16 that their accounts will no longer be active after December 10.\ufeff\n\nInstagram sent out a notification \ufeffto users who will be impacted.\n\n\"Due to laws in Australia, soon you won't be able to use social media until you've turned 16,\" the message reads.\n\n\"You will not be able to use your Instagram account until you've turned 16. This means you can't use Instagram and your profile won't be visible to you or others until then.\n\n\"We'll let you know when you can use Instagram again.\"\n\nIf users want to adjust their birthdate in the apps to get around the ban, Meta has introduced a facial verification system which uses a video selfie.\n\nIt can take between one minute and 48 hours for Meta to verify someone's age via selfie.\ufeff\n\nMeta may also ask users to prove their age by uploading an ID.\n\nSnapchat will use age verification to keep under-16s off the app. (Supplied)\n\nSnapchat\ufeff\n\n\ufeffSnapchat says while it \"strongly disagrees\" with its inclusion, it will comply with the new laws.\n\nSnapchat, owned by Snapchat Inc, \ufeffwill remove self-declared under 16 users and will use behavioural models to identify any other Australian users captured by the ban.\n\nThe platform said in a Senate inquiry earlier this year that an estimated 440,000 users in Australia are aged under 16.\n\nAge verification methods will also be used to identify accounts which should be removed.\n\nUsers can do this through Photo ID, ConnectID via a bank or facial age estimation by k-ID.\n\n\ufeffTikTok, Reddit, X and Kick\n\nTikTok's parent company \ufeffByteDance also opposed the ban but said it would enforce it.\n\nThe app will deactivate any accounts owned by under 16s.\n\nTikTok will ask for selfie IDs and a photo of a government-issued ID to verify the age of users.\n\n\ufeffReddit and Kick \u2013 a livestreaming video app \u2013 were last month added to the list of platforms captured under the ban.\n\nBoth \ufeffwill deactivate accounts for users aged under 16.\n\nX is not particularly popular with younger people but it is also part of the ban in Australia and will deactivate banned users.\n\nX (formerly Twitter) also has live selfies for facial age estimation, powered by AI.\n\nYouTube initially petitioned to be exempt from the ban. (CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images/File via CNN)\n\nYouTube\ufeff\n\nGoogle-owned YouTube fought hard to be exempt from the ban in Australia, even threatening to sue the federal government.\n\nHowever, Grant recommended YouTube be included in the ban after the draft rules were released in June.\n\nWhile Australians under 16 can still watch videos, they won't not be able to create accounts or have access to features such as comment, like or subscribe.\n\nUnder 16s will only be allowed to have an account on YouTube Kids.\n\nAccounts owned by children will be automatically deactivated by the app.\n\nYouTube also uses an \"age estimation model\" to determine the age of users currently.\ufeff\n\nIf the model incorrectly determines a person's age, users can verify their birthdate by submitting your government ID, credit card or selfie.",

(Supplied)\n\nDo you have a story? Contact reporter April Glover at april.glover@nine.com.au\n\n\"Kids will be kids, of course,\" Carol, 81, told nine.com.au .\n\n\"He and his friends would pick up a rock, go up the top and throw it down.\n\n\"He went down to pick up more rocks and slipped on the slime in the bottom of the stormwater drain. As he fell, he dropped the rock and it ended up on his thumb.\"\n\nCarol took her grandson to the emergency department at Campbelltown Hospital, where he was X-rayed, bandaged, given pain relief and sent to Liverpool Hospital for more treatment.\n\nRobert needed emergency surgery, which required irrigation and removal of dead tissue, however the operation was delayed as surgeons took on higher-priority cases.\n\nThe operation took place 16 hours later, before Robert was given antibiotics and sent home.\n\nRobert later \"bumped\" his wound when he fell from a swing.\n\nGangrene and infection set in, turning part of his thumb black.\n\n\"We went back to Campbelltown Hospital, and [the doctor] unravelled it and flushed it out but he screamed because it was so sore,\" Carol said.\n\nA second surgery would be needed to address the dangerous infection.\n\n\"Two or three days later he had the operation and they said, 'We don't know if we have to amputate,\" she added.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, you let us know if you do'.\n\n\"And after he'd had the operation\u2026 we found out they'd amputated it.\"\n\nRobert in kindergarten in 2007. (Supplied)\n\nRobert woke up from the general anaesthesia with a chunk of his left thumb missing.\n\nHe was left with just a small nub.\n\n\"When he found out, he wouldn't speak to anyone,\" Carol recalled.\n\nRobert agreed. \"I was pretty distraught,\" he told 9news.com.au\n\n\"I always thought it was going to grow back.\"\n\nCarol was furious too \u2013 she believes she had not been adequately notified of the amputation.\n\nCarol said she would have asked them to explore other options if she had known.\n\n\"I will stand up for my children and grandchildren and I don't care how old they are,\" Carol said.\n\n\"Until my last breath\".\n\nRobert, his father Peter, and Carol took the fight to the courts, suing the South Western Sydney Local Health District for medical negligence.\n\nThe court documents filed on Robert's behalf accused the health district of the \"needless surgical amputation of the distal phalanx of his left thumb\ufeff\" due to delayed and inadequate treatment.\n\nThe young Sydney boy had his thumb partially amputated. (Supplied)\n\nRobert, aged 13 at the time, claimed he was medically mistreated at the hospital on August 22, 2011 and in the ensuing days.\n\nIt was also alleged in court that the antibiotic regime prescribed to Robert was not appropriate.\n\nMeanwhile, the defence claimed the evidence \"casts serious doubt on the plaintiff's compliance with post-operative orders regarding the care for his surgically repaired thumb\".\n\nIn 2017, Robert was awarded damages totalling $240,930.10, and Carol put it in a trust until her grandson was of legal age.\n\nCarol acknowledged it wouldn't get Robert's thumb back but said it would \"help him along\" in life.\n\nIn the last 14 years, Robert said he's struggled with work and using his hand with a large part of his digit missing.\n\nHe also faced bullying at school.\n\n\"I feel like a thumb, believe it or not, is worth a lot more than that, personally,\" he said.\n\nBut the NSW Court of Appeal overturned the verdict the following year on April 13, 2018.\n\nSouth Western Sydney Local Health District was found not to be at fault.\n\nThe decision was reversed and they were made to hand back the money.\n\nNine.com.au is not suggesting any wrongdoing on the part of the South Western Sydney Local Health District. They declined to comment. Nine.com.au has also reached out to Campbelltown Council for comment.\n\nIt was a major setback for the Gould family's legal plight.\n\nGoulds become tangled in lawyer saga\n\nThe next option was to launch a civil case against the local council.\n\nThis is when a solicitor named Sandra Primerano made the ordeal infinitely more complicated.\n\nCarol engaged Schreuder Partners Compensation Lawyers, who represented her in the appeal, to help launch a civil suit.\n\nPrimerano was employed by Schreuder Partners from September 25, 2017 until August 11, 2022.\n\nCarol and Primerano spoke on the phone multiple times about her second attempt to sue over Robert's injury.\n\nDuring COVID-19, Carol waited patiently for updates from Primerano about her case.\n\nPrimerano even brought a $30,000 settlement offer to the table, which Carol rejected.\n\nThe only problem? It wasn't real.\n\nIn 2024, Primerano was found to have engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct or conduct likely to mislead or deceive in contravention in a civil case which was heard in the NSW Supreme Court.\n\nThe judge found Primerano misled clients by \"purporting that the plaintiff was providing legal services to them when it was not\".\n\nShe fabricated personal injury settlement offers without the law firm's knowledge. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Schreuder Partners Compensation Lawyers in any way.\n\nCarol and Robert were one of the clients who were misled by Primerano.\n\n\ufeffThe Goulds were led to believe Primerano was assisting them in personal injury proceedings against Campbelltown City Council without the knowledge or approval of Schreuder Partners.\n\n\"It was as though we'd done all this for nothing, spoke to everyone, wasted my time, took time off work, drove all those hours\u2026\" Robert said\n\n\"I just couldn't understand it,\" Carol added.\n\nPrimerano was ordered to pay $179,140 in damages and legal costs to Schreuder Partners.\n\nRobert pictured now. (Supplied)\n\nLeft with no options\ufeff\n\nOnce again, the Goulds were left with nothing.\n\n\"I thought\u2026 What the heck can I do now? It's like sitting up in the air again,\" Carol said.\n\n\"I feel like it's my fault. He's my grandson, I was doing this to help him.\"\n\nRobert said the debacle has made it difficult for him to trust anyone.\n\nExcept, of course, his grandmother.\n\n\"She's a gem,\" he said.\n\nNow, Carol and Robert are worried there is nothing else they can do.\n\nPersonal injuries statutes of limitations in Australia means claimants have three years from the date of accident to make and resolve a claim or at least commence court proceedings.\n\nThere are limited circumstances where a court may grant an extension of time for a person to still bring a claim, according to Shine Lawyers.\n\nCarol is hoping Primerano's actions would be regarded as extraordinary circumstances.\n\n\"I would like to see Robert be awarded what he was awarded in the first place,\" Carol said.",

(WWD via Getty Images)\n\nVersace's future\n\nPrada heir Lorenzo Bertelli will steer Versace's next phase as executive chairman, in addition to his roles as group marketing director and sustainability chief.\n\nThe son of co-creative director Miuccia Prada and longtime Prada Group chairman Patrizio Bertelli has said he doesn't expect to make any swift executive changes at Versace. But Bertelli has said that the company, which places among the top 10 most recognised brands in the world, has long been underperforming in the market.\n\nPrada has underlined that the 47-year-old Versace brand offered \"significant untapped growth potential\".\n\nVersace has been in the midst of a creative relaunch under a new designer, Dario Vitale, who previewed his first collection during Milan Fashion Week in September. He had previously been head of design at Miu Miu, but his move to Versace was unrelated to the Prada deal, executives have said.\n\nCapri Holdings, which owns Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, paid $2 billion ($3.05 billion) for Versace in 2018, but had been struggling to position Versace's bold profile in the recent era of \"quiet luxury\".\n\nVersace represented 20 per cent of Capri Holdings 2024 revenue of \u20ac5.2 billion. An analyst presentation for the Prada deal said that Versace would represent 13 per cent of the Prada Group's pro-forma revenues, with Miu Miu coming in at 22 per cent and Prada at 64 per cent.

(ABC Goulburn Murray: Erin Somerville) \"This early change meant our average base rate increased earlier than planned, and when the 2025-26 rate cap was applied, it was calculated on this higher base rate by mistake.\"\n\nThe shire said it would rectify the error by adjusting the rating assessment calculation for the next financial year, and that the breach was \"an honest mistake\".\n\nThe rate increase equated to $168,304 above the capped amount, or an extra $18 for the average ratepayer.\n\nThe council said it would look at setting the 2026-27 rates and charges at least $168,304 lower than what they would be if the council applied the full rate cap set by the government.\n\nIncorrect assumptions\n\nThe Hindmarsh Shire attributed its non-compliance to unintentionally using an early set of estimates when it determined its 2025-26 rates.\n\n\n\n\n\nHindmarsh Shire Council says it has investigated the error and will make sure it does not occur again. (Supplied: Hindmarsh Shire Council) The shire said it was committed to addressing the rate cap breach by decreasing the total rates revenue in the next financial year by a proportionate amount.\n\nIt said initial calculations suggested the increase equated to $3,949 \u2014 less than a dollar a property across all rateable properties.\n\n\"As soon as we became aware of this error, councillors and council officers were committed to identifying a fair resolution for the community,\" Hindmarsh Mayor Ron Ismay said.\n\nThe shire said it investigated the error and it would take steps to prevent the issue from occurring again.",

        "text": "A rare crystal-diamond Faberg\u00e9 egg has sold at a London auction for 22.9 million British pounds ($46 million), smashing records.\n\nThe Winter Egg, bought by an unidentified buyer, was just one of seven of the opulent ovoids remaining in private hands, according to Christie's London auction house.\n\nThe 10-centimetre-tall egg is made from finely carved rock crystal, covered in a delicate snowflake motif wrought in platinum with 4,500 tiny diamonds.\n\nIt opens to reveal a removable tiny basket of bejewelled quartz flowers symbolising spring.\n\nThe Winter Egg's design was the work of a female jeweller in the team, Alma Pihl.\n\nCarl Faberg\u00e9 and his company created more than 50 of the eggs for Russia's imperial family between 1885 and 1917, each elaborately unique and containing a hidden surprise.\n\nTsar Alexander III started the tradition by presenting an egg to his wife each Easter. His successor, Nicholas II, extended the gift to his wife and mother.\n\nThe egg and its base are sculpted from crystal featuring diamond-encrusted platinum snowflakes. (AP: Kirsty Wigglesworth)\n\nNicholas II commissioned the egg for his mother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, as an Easter present in 1913.\n\nThe Romanov royal family ruled Russia for 300 years before the 1917 revolution ousted it. Nicholas and his family were executed in 1918.\n\nBought by a London dealer for 450 British pounds when the cash-strapped communist authorities sold many of Russia's artistic treasures in the 1920s, the egg changed hands several times.\n\nIt was believed lost for two decades until it was auctioned by Christie's in 1994 and again in 2002.\n\nIt is the third time the delicate creation has set an auction record for a work by Faberg\u00e9, Christie's said.\n\nMargo Oganesian, the head of Christie's Russian art department, called the egg \"the 'Mona Lisa' for decorative arts,\" a superb example of craft and design.\n\nThere are 43 surviving imperial Faberg\u00e9 eggs, most of them in museums.\n\nAP/AFP",

(Supplied: Biodiverse Environmental)\n\nMr Pratt said the nest was moved as the birds were preparing to lay eggs because of ongoing construction on the site.\n\n\"We thought it was best to just go ahead and relocate them to try and minimise the disturbance over the longer period,\" he said.\n\nA specialist arborist assisted in its removal from the tree, while a 60-tonne crane lowered the mass into a specially engineered basket.\n\nA specialist arborist and crane operators assisted in the relocation. (Supplied: Biodiverse Environmental)\n\nThe basket was then secured to a large pole structure and repositioned at its new location underneath another tree canopy nearby.\n\nMr Pratt said the company had been monitoring the nest since the operation but the eagles so far had not returned.\n\n\"They're very sensitive to, you know, if there's any threat nearby, they will give up nesting,\" he said.\n\n\"We were expecting the disturbance to impact them, but we also have very good hopes that they'll come back to it next year when they're more comfortable.\"\n\nThe nest was cordoned off at the construction site. (Supplied: Biodiverse Environmental)\n\nA spokesperson for Health Minister Tim Nicholls did not comment on how much the project cost.\n\nBut Mr Pratt estimated the work cost $100,000.\n\n\"It's over an extended period as well because there's a whole lot of monitoring happening and work to be done afterwards,\" he said.\n\n\" We really need to look after such a special animal that has such an important part in the ecology. \"\n\nHospital delivery\n\nIt comes as the government has gone back to the drawing board on the new hospital design in Bundaberg.\n\nIn a statement, Mr Nicholls said work at the project site continued \"delivering services including electricity, drainage, roads and access\".\n\nHe said the state government was committed to a new hospital with more than 410 beds, emergency and maternity services and a multi-storey car park.\n\nTim Nicholls visits the new Bundaberg Hospital site. (ABC News: Grace Whiteside)\n\nThe government's Hospital Rescue Plan and new timeline for the delivery are expected to be announced by the end of the year.\n\nThe new Bundaberg Hospital is among a list of key Queensland health-related projects that are facing significant delays due to spiralling costs.\n\nA spokesperson for the minister said a range of environmental measures had been included to support local wildlife on the site and meet obligations under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.\n\nThe nest was positioned underneath another tree canopy nearby. (Supplied: Biodiverse Environmental)\n\nMonitoring wildlife\n\nWhile the eagles were yet to return, the company said it had spotted a range of wildlife in the surrounding bushland.\n\nMr Pratt said the company had installed cameras and 40 nest boxes for a range of different species in the surrounding bushland, which would be monitored for three years.\n\n\"Immediately we had possums, sugar gliders, some small parrots \u2026 there's been a whole lot of activity in those nests,\" he said.\n\nMr Pratt said he did not believe the ongoing building works would have a \"significant impact\" on wildlife and nesting eagles, as there was a large parcel of established bushland near the project.",

The rise aligned with an increase in imports of capital goods.\n\n\"The rise in machinery and equipment investment reflects the ongoing expansions of data centres,\" Ms Kim said.\n\n\" This is likely due to firms looking to support growth in artificial intelligence and cloud computing capabilities. \"\n\nNational AI Plan drops 'mandatory guardrails' for artificial intelligence The federal government's long awaited National AI Plan will seek to accelerate the growth of artificial intelligence in Australia, and largely leverage existing laws to protect against its worst harms.\n\nIncreased investor demand for housing fed into high real estate turnover and a rise in dwelling construction.\n\nHousing investment contributed 0.2 percentage points to GDP growth in the September quarter.\n\nPublic investment grew by 3 per cent in the September quarter, rebounding from a 3.5 per cent fall in the June quarter.\n\nPublic corporations drove the rise, with investment growth in renewable energy, water, telecommunications and rail transport projects.\n\nState and local government investment grew 1.4 per cent in the quarter but remained 2.4 per cent lower than a year ago.",

But the Crown Estate said the property was so dilapidated that in \u201call likelihood\u201d he would \u201cnot be owed any compensation\u201d.\n\nIt also admitted that an independent architect had been appointed to monitor the upkeep, but that inspections were carried out on a \u201cneed-only\u201d basis. While Andrew is still living in sprawling Windsor property, he remains responsible for its ongoing costs of maintenance and repair. Andrew with his former wife, Sarah Ferguson, in April.

The documents also show that Andrew retains a lease with the Crown Estate on a lodge in the grounds of Sunninghill Park, his marital home, which is occupied by a member of staff.\n\nAndrew sold the 12-bedroom mansion, which was a wedding gift from the late Queen Elizabeth, to Kazakh billionaire Timur Kulibayev, in 2007 for \u00a315 million \u2013 \u00a33 million over the asking price \u2013 only for it to remain empty for almost a decade. The spending watchdog also published information about Prince William and Princess Catherine\u2019s lease on Forest Lodge, the Wales\u2019 new Windsor home. The committee said the couple, who moved into the property with their children in October, has a \u201c20-year non-assignable lease\u201d with the Crown Estate that began on July 5 this year with \u201copen market rent\u201d. The agreement was made after the prince made an initial approach, following discussions with the royal household.\n\nThe Crown Estate said: \u201cNegotiations were conducted on an arm\u2019s length basis, to ensure appropriate market terms were agreed.\u201d It said independent valuers from Hamptons and Savills estate agents were appointed to value the property, while the prince and princess received independent legal and property advice.

Like Andrew, who paid an initial outlay of \u00a38.5 million between 2003 and 2005, the duke paid \u00a35 million up front on a 150-year lease.\n\nMeanwhile, Princess Alexandra, Elizabeth II\u2019s cousin, pays little more than \u00a32700 a year to live in the Grade II-listed Thatched House Lodge within Richmond Park.

The date of its first evidence session will be announced in due course. Clifton-Brown said: \u201cWe would like to thank the Crown Estate commissioners and HM Treasury for their considered responses to our questions.\n\n\u201cIn publishing these responses, the public accounts committee fulfils one of its primary purposes \u2013 to aid transparency in public interest information, as part of its overall mission to secure value for money for the taxpayer. \u201cHaving reflected on what we have received, the information provided clearly forms the beginnings of a basis for an inquiry. The National Audit Office (NAO) supports the scrutiny function of this committee. \u201cWe now await the conclusions the NAO will draw from this information, and plan to hold an inquiry based on the resulting evidence base in the new year.\u201d Crown Estate chief executive Dan Labbad said: \u201cWe very much welcome the news of the committee\u2019s inquiry. We have provided detailed answers to the committee\u2019s questions to date and look forward to working with the NAO and responding to further questions to support the inquiry process.\u201d The Crown Estate \u2013 a vast portfolio of land and property \u2013 belongs to the reigning monarch \u201cin right of the Crown\u201d but is not their private property.",

If invited to join the club, prospective members have to pay $US35,000 ($53,000) up front and then an annual fee of about $US15,000, according to online reports .\n\nThe Future Fund is Australia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and invests and manages major agencies including the Medical Research Future Fund, the Housing Australia Future Fund and five other entities. It was established in 2006.\n\nDuring questioning in Senate Estimates on Tuesday evening, Arndt was accused by Senator David Pocock of spending taxpayer money \u201cin a cavalier way\u201d, as the Future Fund boss admitted he had visited the Disney club but \u201cnot as a recreational activity\u201d and was unable to say if taxpayers or Disney picked up the bill for that trip.\n\nFuture Fund chief executive Raphael Arndt sent his executive assistant on at least two business class trips overseas, including one to inspect hotel rooms for the executives, while Arndt attended the exclusive members-only Club 33 at Disneyland.\n\nArndt said he went to the exclusive Disney club to learn about the entertainment giant\u2019s training programs.\n\n\u201cOn one of the trips we did, when we were looking at setting up a Learning Academy for the Future Fund, The Future Fund Academy, which teaches culture, one of the peer groups that we identified in the study was Disney and the Disney University, because they do cultural induction for their teams in a way that seems quite effective. And so we organised for some meetings with a person who was involved in that activity, and had a tour of the facility, which included lunch at the location that you are referring to.\u201d\n\nDuring the hearing on Tuesday evening, independent senator David Pocock asked Arndt if his former executive assistant, who was not named, had ever travelled overseas for work.\n\n\u201cI can think of twice, but it might be more, but she supported a board trip, and she also went on a trip to assess hotels as to their suitability for our staff and support with one other person, the negotiation of rates with hotels to get better deals,\u201d Arndt said.\n\n\u201cSo it was my view when I became the CEO that it would make sense to centralise that function [travel booking] and negotiate rates with hotels. The business case that was put up, which I\u2019ve looked at recently, so I recall it, was that the trip would cost about $20,000 and that the annual savings should be at least $30,000 and my understanding is we\u2019ve realised more savings than that as a result of that project.",

        "text": "Then, as those commitments and the scale of funding required to meet them ratcheted up, they began raising debt, some of it off the balance sheet, to underwrite the trillions of dollars of spending they have committed to. Loading That\u2019s a pretty fragile industry structure, which revolves around Nvidia and OpenAI at its centre. On Monday, OpenAI\u2019s chief executive - in a memo to staff first reported by the technology-focused online publication The Information - declared a \u201ccode red,\u201d accelerating efforts to improve the quality of its ChatGPT chatbot while deferring development of a range of products \u2013 advertising, shopping, health and other apps \u2013 that it had hoped would generate more revenue from ChatGPT. That sudden note of urgency came after it became evident that OpenAI is facing serious competition for the first time in the three years since it launched ChatGPT and started the frenzy around AI.\n\nAs it happens that competition also threats to erode Nvidia\u2019s dominance and the massive margins \u2013 a gross margin of around 70 per cent \u2013 it has conferred. The challenger? Alphabet\u2019s Google. Late last month, The Information revealed that Google was discussing plans to sell its own internally developed AI chips to Meta in a multibillion-dollar deal, weakening Nvidia\u2019s hold on the AI hardware sector. Google had also quite recently released its chatbot, Gemini 3, which was widely considered to be able to outperform OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 5. Thus Google had emerged as a threat to both Nvidia and its biggest customers. Google is also thought to be one of the four hyperscalers who between them account for more than 60 per cent of Nvidia\u2019s revenue, so the threat posed by Google\u2019s development of its own source of chips has more than one layer. It\u2019s not just Google. Amazon \u2013 the world\u2019s largest provider of cloud services \u2013 has only just started installing its latest chip, Tranium3, in data centres.\n\nNeither Google\u2019s TPU\u2019s (Tensor Processing Units) nor Amazon\u2019s chip are as flexible or versatile as Nvidia\u2019s GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which is why it was able to grab dominance of the training of AI\u2019s large language models. Loading Where the challengers\u2019 strengths lie is in inference, or where the AI model actually deploys the knowledge that has been poured into it, which is where the market for AI is shifting. While they can\u2019t do as much as Nvidia\u2019s chips, what they can do they do well and far more cheaply and faster, with less energy consumed, than Nvidia\u2019s chips. It\u2019s also the case \u2013 as the negotiations with Meta demonstrate \u2013 that there is an appetite within the sector for competing sources of supply to dilute the risks and costs of the dependence on Nvidia. Nvidia was so unsettled by the sudden emergence of Google as a threat that it did something out of character and posted a defence of its position on X, saying it was delighted by Google\u2019s success, but \u201cNvidia is a generation ahead of the industry \u2013 it\u2019s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.\u201d\n\nGoogle has serious firepower to fund its ambitions. Now it is firmly in the contest to be one of what\u2019s likely to be a very small number of very large players that emerge as the dominant forces in AI. It has no debt, indeed it has net cash of around $US100 billion and around $US150 billion a year of cashflows to fund its ambitions. OpenAI, for instance, has a revenue run-rate of only about $US20 billion, hence its reliance on equity raisings, vendor financing and debt. Google also has its \u201cstack,\u201d or a vertically integrated suite of products \u2013platforms, infrastructure, hardware and software \u2013 that can be deployed to boost the take-up of Gemini. Gemini 2 was launched a year ago. By May this year, it had about 400 million monthly active users. Today it has more than 650 million. ChatGPT has about 800 million weekly active users \u2013 it remains dominant, but the gap is closing. Google\u2019s sudden acceleration into the AI space, coupled with the efforts of all hyperscalers to diversify their supplier base, develop their own chips and reduce their reliance on Nvidia, doesn\u2019t mean that Nvidia and OpenAI can\u2019t also survive and still be there when the sector has been rationalised, as it inevitably will be.",

Why working from home is necessary for modern families\n\nAs for hybrid working, this had a major well-being boost for women, but only in particular situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen women spent some time on-site or in the office each week, and worked from home, the biggest mental health gains were noted.\n\n\n\n\n\nGains were comparable to those from a 15 per cent rise in household income.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor women with poorer mental health, flexible work arrangements led to better mental health.\n\n\n\nThe study noted less work stress and helping women to juggle work and life were other benefits of working from home.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor men, working from home did not make a measurable effect on mental health, positive or negative.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report mentioned that this could be due to the unequal division of domestic and caregiving responsibilities, which disproportionately fall on women and constrain their spatial mobility.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers with poorer mental health were found to be more sensitive to long commutes and most likely to benefit from flexible working arrangements.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor women commuting, there was no detectable effect. But for men, longer commutes equated to poorer mental health for those who already had issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a man near the middle of the mental health distribution adding half an hour to his one-way commute reduced reported mental health by roughly the same amount as a 2 per cent drop in household income, the authors wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor workers who don\u2019t have problems with their mental health, commuting and working from home don\u2019t have much of an impact on them. Yet they still may value flexibility, the study found.\n\n\n\n",

Source: AAP / Lukas Coch The communications minister will point to almost 86 per cent of Australian children between the ages of eight and 15 being on social media.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We accept it will take time for the age assurance sieve to filter out the existing accounts and stop new accounts from being created,\" she will say.\n\n\n\nMeta to begin removing underage accounts\n\nMeta will start booting children off its platforms \u2014 which include Instagram and Facebook \u2014 from Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsers wrongly identified will be able to verify their age with third-party platform Yoti or provide government-issued ID.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral other platforms are using similar methods, but TikTok is yet to reveal what its appeal process will be.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe day after the ban is implemented, the eSafety commissioner will send notices to the 10 platforms named in their \"dynamic list\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Meta admits there may be mistakes as it brings teenager social media ban forward\n\nThese notices will ask for evidence, such as how many underage accounts the platforms had before the law started, and then after its implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\nTech companies face fines of up to $49.5 million if they fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to block young users from the cut-off date under the new laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those platforms will have time to reply, before the next round of information requests are sent out asking for updated figures every month for six months,\" the minister will say.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatforms must implement age-assurance technology, but a specific type or method has not been mandated by the eSafety Commission.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has flagged the list of platforms could grow to capture more under the ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With reporting by the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Tomi Cao was excited to take over a spa and wellness business in Queensland, but she didn't have much time to enjoy her new gig, quickly realising something was very wrong with an external payments system.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe discovered that Groupon, a major online couponing website, had been sending money meant for her to the previous owner of the business, despite multiple attempts to correct the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nCao took over the An Head Spa & Wellness business in Brisbane at the end of October, and is now turning to regulators for help to get her money from Groupon, as she's yet to be paid for dozens of sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it's been a tough journey to try and get her money back, telling SBS News \"It's scary to speak up, especially speaking up against such a large multinational corporation like Groupon.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCao was nervous about sharing her story on social media, but said once she did so people were largely supportive.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the previous owner notified Groupon of the change in ownership before the settlement date.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of the new business purchase, she inherited several ongoing campaigns on Groupon. Customers would buy discounted deals online, then redeem them in-store. The platform was supposed to deposit payments directly into Cao's merchant account.\n\n\n\nTomi Cao has alleged Groupon has paid weeks worth of payments owed to her spa business to the wrong account. Source: Supplied / An Head Spa & Wellness But weeks went by without any payment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My understanding is that their merchants are getting paid weekly every Wednesday \u2026 that's the information [I received] from the previous owner,\" Cao said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we missed the first payment, I think perhaps it's just to get everything updated. The second week is when I start noticing we still haven't got any payment and the thing is, we were redeeming customers vouchers daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To give you an idea of the volumes \u2026 last Saturday, we had 12 vouchers that were paid through coupons.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the 31-year-old, she submitted all documentation requested by Groupon, including business transfer forms, ABN details, bank information, contracts, and identification. But after repeated emails, the situation hadn\u2019t changed \u2014 and no clear timeline was provided for when it might.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn emails seen by SBS, Cao also let Groupon know that she couldn\u2019t see how many vouchers had been redeemed in the website\u2019s backend.\n\n\n\nCao says Groupon's failure to pay her for sessions has created issues with her business' cashflow. Source: Supplied / An Head Spa and Wellness In an email dated Friday 14 November, she tells the site's support team that: \"The Merchant Centre/dashboard shows $0 and no redemption data\" \u2026 and \"We currently have no visibility over what has been redeemed\" \u2014 leaving the business unsure exactly how much was owed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This,\" Cao writes, \"is creating issues for our cash flow ... especially during a busy trading period.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCao told SBS: \"I explicitly asked \u2026 I just want to make sure money does not go to the wrong account and they told me more than once, nothing will go to the previous owner\u2019s account.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And, later on, we found out that wasn't the truth.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGroupon admits in one email that funds had in fact been sent to the previous owner, who now lives overseas.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Cao's small salon, even a handful of unpaid vouchers has been costly. Immediate cashflow can prove vital for small businesses to stay afloat, and take care of immediate expenses like wages, superannuation, product costs and overhead costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nCao said the situation put her in an impossible position: refuse the coupons and frustrate customers, or accept them and take a financial loss.\n\n\n\nCustomers caught in the middle\n\nShe had to make a difficult decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nCao told Groupon \u2014 and informed her clients on social media \u2014 she wouldn\u2019t honour vouchers for new bookings from 20 November, and that she would redirect customers back to the site for a refund.\n\n\n\nFor Cao's small business, missing payments from Groupon have had a big effect. Source: Supplied / An Head Spa and Wellness She said some customers were frustrated or confused when told the vouchers would no longer be accepted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are told that we are scamming people. We're told that: 'I'm reporting your business'. We're told that basically: 'I don't want to go back to Groupon for a refund. You fix it'.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCao also said she had feelings of guilt, knowing she probably wouldn\u2019t be able to go through with the cancellations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just don't have the heart to go out and cancel on everyone because they would have already arranged childcare, they would have arranged leave, time off, and a lot of those were bought for someone as a gift.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everyone's already booked \u2026 booked well into January 2026.\"\n\n\n\nEscalating the issue\n\nAfter weeks of unsuccessful negotiations, the owner lodged complaints with the Office of Fair Trading Queensland (OFTQ) and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) on 26 November.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I just really need Groupon to be held accountable,\" Cao said. \"Because I know I'm not alone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut these processes take time. According to OFTQ\u2019s website, it can take 30 days to hear back from the agency, and even longer for more complex cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf they\u2019re unable to resolve the case, civil action may be required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Reading up online, I know so many other small businesses who are just forced to stay silent \u2026 They have no idea how to navigate the legal system,\" Cao said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these businesses you see on the platforms \u2026 many of them are migrant-owned and just have business owners with English as a second language they speak at home.\"\n\n\n\nGroupon\u2019s response\n\nIn a written statement to SBS, Groupon said: \"We\u2019re sorry for the frustration this situation has caused, this is not the experience we want any partner to have when working with Groupon.\"\n\n\n\nThe company said the documentation confirming the ownership change had not been finalised. \"Once the change was verified, we escalated the matter immediately and approved payment to the new owner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The payment is expected this week. We are in direct contact with both parties; recovering the funds issued to the previous owner and ensuring that customers are fully supported.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGroupon said it recognises \"this transition could have been handled more smoothly and apologise for any inconvenience caused.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our focus remains on resolving this matter in good faith and supporting the small businesses who rely on our platform.\"\n\n\n\nA waiting game\n\nFor now, Cao is still waiting for the payments to hit her bank account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We finally received a small payment from Groupon yesterday covering only last week\u2019s redemptions up to Wednesday,\" she told SBS on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"However, the original amount in [the] dispute, funds that were misdirected to the previous owner, remains outstanding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said she hopes her complaint will highlight the vulnerability of small businesses relying on external payment systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's the holiday [season] where people are booking in,\" she said.\n\n\n\n",

Trump was overlooked for the award, which went to Venezuela's Mar\u00eda Corina Machado for her work in promoting democratic rights in her country.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Infantino said: \"In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it is fundamental to recognise the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgakis said: \"FIFA\u2019s got more members than the United Nations, and it can ultimately argue that 'we can bring, countries which are historically hostile to each other or even currently involved in conflicts, together and through the institution of football, we can bring peace around the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome have questioned FIFA about getting involved in politics.\n\n\n\nInfantino supported Trump\u2019s nomination for this year\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize. Source: Getty / Alex Grimm Georgakis said: \"We may have some of the smallest and some of the poorest countries in the world being able to compete against some of the heavyweights of international football, but also rich and powerful communities. That's the real beauty of the sport of football, an institution which really can inspire both boys and girls to take part in sport.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMost recently, Human Rights Watch sent a letter asking for information on the criteria and process for deciding the prize winner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nothing in the world is politically free, but of course, we would like to think that sports sits outside of geopolitical issues,\" Georgakis said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Infantino] is trying to make sure there are no surprises at the World Cup. So it makes a lot of sense to align yourself with someone (Trump) who ultimately can make or break you. And there\u2019s a lot at stake for FIFA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They really want this to be a very successful World Cup because from the billions of dollars they\u2019ll make out of the World Cup, they want to use this money to, as Infantino says, bring the world together through football.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Bicycle kicks and tears: Here are the teams who have qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup\n\nThe World Cup draw will allocate qualifying nations to the 12 four-team groups, setting the schedule for the opening phase of the 48-team, 104-game tournament being played in 16 cities across the US, Canada and Mexico next year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Infantino] doesn\u2019t want to be caught in a situation where a couple of days before the start of the World Cup, Trump\u2019s announcing that he\u2019s shutting down cities and wants to move matches to other cities,\" Georgakis said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch the draw, and all 104 games of the FIFA World Cup 26\u2122 LIVE, FREE and EXCLUSIVE on SBS, SBS VICELAND and SBS On Demand .\n\n\n\n",

But the Crown Estate said the property was so dilapidated that in \u201call likelihood\u201d he would \u201cnot be owed any compensation\u201d.\n\nIt also admitted that an independent architect had been appointed to monitor the upkeep, but that inspections were carried out on a \u201cneed-only\u201d basis.

The documents also show that Andrew retains a lease with the Crown Estate on a lodge in the grounds of Sunninghill Park, his marital home, which is occupied by a member of staff.\n\nAndrew sold the 12-bedroom mansion, which was a wedding gift from the late Queen Elizabeth, to Kazakh billionaire Timur Kulibayev, in 2007 for \u00a315 million \u2013 \u00a33 million over the asking price \u2013 only for it to remain empty for almost a decade. The spending watchdog also published information about Prince William and Princess Catherine\u2019s lease on Forest Lodge, the Wales\u2019 new Windsor home. The committee said the couple, who moved into the property with their children in October, has a \u201c20-year non-assignable lease\u201d with the Crown Estate that began on July 5 this year with \u201copen market rent\u201d. The agreement was made after the prince made an initial approach, following discussions with the royal household.\n\nThe Crown Estate said: \u201cNegotiations were conducted on an arm\u2019s length basis, to ensure appropriate market terms were agreed.\u201d It said independent valuers from Hamptons and Savills estate agents were appointed to value the property, while the prince and princess received independent legal and property advice.

Like Andrew, who paid an initial outlay of \u00a38.5 million between 2003 and 2005, the duke paid \u00a35 million up front on a 150-year lease.\n\nMeanwhile, Princess Alexandra, Elizabeth II\u2019s cousin, pays little more than \u00a32700 a year to live in the Grade II-listed Thatched House Lodge within Richmond Park. Loading Clifton-Brown said that, having \u201creflected\u201d on the information provided, the committee had decided to launch an inquiry based on the information it had received from the Treasury and Crown Estate, as well as from the National Audit Office, which recently updated a report it produced in 2005 examining the royal family\u2019s leases. The date of its first evidence session will be announced in due course. Clifton-Brown said: \u201cWe would like to thank the Crown Estate commissioners and HM Treasury for their considered responses to our questions.\n\n\u201cIn publishing these responses, the public accounts committee fulfils one of its primary purposes \u2013 to aid transparency in public interest information, as part of its overall mission to secure value for money for the taxpayer. \u201cHaving reflected on what we have received, the information provided clearly forms the beginnings of a basis for an inquiry. The National Audit Office (NAO) supports the scrutiny function of this committee. \u201cWe now await the conclusions the NAO will draw from this information, and plan to hold an inquiry based on the resulting evidence base in the new year.\u201d Crown Estate chief executive Dan Labbad said: \u201cWe very much welcome the news of the committee\u2019s inquiry. We have provided detailed answers to the committee\u2019s questions to date and look forward to working with the NAO and responding to further questions to support the inquiry process.\u201d The Crown Estate \u2013 a vast portfolio of land and property \u2013 belongs to the reigning monarch \u201cin right of the Crown\u201d but is not their private property.",

If invited to join the club, prospective members have to pay $US35,000 ($53,000) up front and then an annual fee of about $US15,000, according to online reports .\n\nThe Future Fund is Australia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and invests and manages major agencies including the Medical Research Future Fund, the Housing Australia Future Fund and five other entities. It was established in 2006.\n\nDuring questioning in Senate Estimates on Tuesday evening, Arndt was accused by Senator David Pocock of spending taxpayer money \u201cin a cavalier way\u201d, as the Future Fund boss admitted he had visited the Disney club but \u201cnot as a recreational activity\u201d and was unable to say if taxpayers or Disney picked up the bill for that trip.\n\nFuture Fund chief executive Raphael Arndt sent his executive assistant on at least two business class trips overseas, including one to inspect hotel rooms for the executives, while Arndt attended the exclusive members-only Club 33 at Disneyland.\n\nArndt said he went to the exclusive Disney club to learn about the entertainment giant\u2019s training programs.\n\n\u201cOn one of the trips we did, when we were looking at setting up a Learning Academy for the Future Fund, The Future Fund Academy, which teaches culture, one of the peer groups that we identified in the study was Disney and the Disney University, because they do cultural induction for their teams in a way that seems quite effective. And so we organised for some meetings with a person who was involved in that activity, and had a tour of the facility, which included lunch at the location that you are referring to.\u201d\n\nDuring the hearing on Tuesday evening, independent senator David Pocock asked Arndt if his former executive assistant, who was not named, had ever travelled overseas for work.\n\n\u201cI can think of twice, but it might be more, but she supported a board trip, and she also went on a trip to assess hotels as to their suitability for our staff and support with one other person, the negotiation of rates with hotels to get better deals,\u201d Arndt said.\n\n\u201cSo it was my view when I became the CEO that it would make sense to centralise that function [travel booking] and negotiate rates with hotels. The business case that was put up, which I\u2019ve looked at recently, so I recall it, was that the trip would cost about $20,000 and that the annual savings should be at least $30,000 and my understanding is we\u2019ve realised more savings than that as a result of that project.",

        "text": "Then, as those commitments and the scale of funding required to meet them ratcheted up, they began raising debt, some of it off the balance sheet, to underwrite the trillions of dollars of spending they have committed to. Loading That\u2019s a pretty fragile industry structure, which revolves around Nvidia and OpenAI at its centre. On Monday, OpenAI\u2019s chief executive - in a memo to staff first reported by the technology-focused online publication The Information - declared a \u201ccode red,\u201d accelerating efforts to improve the quality of its ChatGPT chatbot while deferring development of a range of products \u2013 advertising, shopping, health and other apps \u2013 that it had hoped would generate more revenue from ChatGPT. That sudden note of urgency came after it became evident that OpenAI is facing serious competition for the first time in the three years since it launched ChatGPT and started the frenzy around AI.\n\nAs it happens that competition also threats to erode Nvidia\u2019s dominance and the massive margins \u2013 a gross margin of around 70 per cent \u2013 it has conferred. The challenger? Alphabet\u2019s Google. Late last month, The Information revealed that Google was discussing plans to sell its own internally developed AI chips to Meta in a multibillion-dollar deal, weakening Nvidia\u2019s hold on the AI hardware sector. Google had also quite recently released its chatbot, Gemini 3, which was widely considered to be able to outperform OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT 5. Thus Google had emerged as a threat to both Nvidia and its biggest customers. Google is also thought to be one of the four hyperscalers who between them account for more than 60 per cent of Nvidia\u2019s revenue, so the threat posed by Google\u2019s development of its own source of chips has more than one layer. It\u2019s not just Google. Amazon \u2013 the world\u2019s largest provider of cloud services \u2013 has only just started installing its latest chip, Tranium3, in data centres.\n\nNeither Google\u2019s TPU\u2019s (Tensor Processing Units) nor Amazon\u2019s chip are as flexible or versatile as Nvidia\u2019s GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which is why it was able to grab dominance of the training of AI\u2019s large language models. Loading Where the challengers\u2019 strengths lie is in inference, or where the AI model actually deploys the knowledge that has been poured into it, which is where the market for AI is shifting. While they can\u2019t do as much as Nvidia\u2019s chips, what they can do they do well and far more cheaply and faster, with less energy consumed, than Nvidia\u2019s chips. It\u2019s also the case \u2013 as the negotiations with Meta demonstrate \u2013 that there is an appetite within the sector for competing sources of supply to dilute the risks and costs of the dependence on Nvidia. Nvidia was so unsettled by the sudden emergence of Google as a threat that it did something out of character and posted a defence of its position on X, saying it was delighted by Google\u2019s success, but \u201cNvidia is a generation ahead of the industry \u2013 it\u2019s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.\u201d\n\nGoogle has serious firepower to fund its ambitions. Now it is firmly in the contest to be one of what\u2019s likely to be a very small number of very large players that emerge as the dominant forces in AI. It has no debt, indeed it has net cash of around $US100 billion and around $US150 billion a year of cashflows to fund its ambitions. OpenAI, for instance, has a revenue run-rate of only about $US20 billion, hence its reliance on equity raisings, vendor financing and debt. Google also has its \u201cstack,\u201d or a vertically integrated suite of products \u2013platforms, infrastructure, hardware and software \u2013 that can be deployed to boost the take-up of Gemini. Gemini 2 was launched a year ago. By May this year, it had about 400 million monthly active users. Today it has more than 650 million. ChatGPT has about 800 million weekly active users \u2013 it remains dominant, but the gap is closing. Google\u2019s sudden acceleration into the AI space, coupled with the efforts of all hyperscalers to diversify their supplier base, develop their own chips and reduce their reliance on Nvidia, doesn\u2019t mean that Nvidia and OpenAI can\u2019t also survive and still be there when the sector has been rationalised, as it inevitably will be.",
