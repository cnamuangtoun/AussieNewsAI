        "text": "Millions of dollars have been wiped from the value of some of Australia's largest healthcare companies immediately after US President Donald Trump announced he would introduce a 100 per cent tariff on all imported medicines, starting October 1.\n\nVaccine giant CSL registered a sharp 7 per cent drop, as did radiology company Pro Medicus, in just the first 15 minutes of trade.\n\nPrices in both shares rallied soon after, but still dragged the ASX200 down to a minor loss at the time of publishing.\n\nDonald Trump has announced a 100 per cent tariff on imported medicines. (Truth Social)\n\nThe sheer plummet came after a Truth Social post in which Trump stipulated a much-mooted tariff on imported pharmaceuticals would begin within days.\n\n\"Starting October 1st, 2025, we will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product, unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n\"'IS BUILDING' will be defined as, 'breaking ground' and/or 'under construction.' There will, therefore, be no Tariff on these Pharmaceutical Products if construction has started. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"\n\nIf the costs of the tariffs are passed on to consumers, the price of imported medicine in the US could\ufeff effectively double.\n\nThis is also a decision that will have a potentially outsized impact on Australia, as vaccines are one of our largest exports to the US.\n\nIn 2024, Australia exported about $2.07 billion worth of pharmaceutical products to the US.\n\nREAD MORE: Dramatic change in polar vortex threatens to shake up spring weather\n\nThe decision could increase medicine prices in the US. (Getty)\n\nWhile that pales in comparison to larger medicine exporters such as Switzerland (which exported $4\ufeff5.9 billion worth of pharmaceuticals to the US in 2023), it is still a significant slice of Australia's trade with the US - though exports to the US overall are only a small part of Australia's global trade.\n\nAustralian beef exports to the US have grown this year despite a 10 per cent tariff in place, but it remains to be seen how medicine distributors stateside will react.\n\nTrump also announced import tariffs of 50 per cent on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30 per cent on upholstered furniture, and 25 per cent on heavy trucks.\n\nPresident Donald Trump. (AP)\n\nTrump said foreign-made furniture was \"flooding\" the US.\n\n\"It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process,\" he said.\n\nHe said the truck tariffs was to protect local manufacturers from \"unfair outside competition\".",

        "text": "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that he says will allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns laid out by the law.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed legislation last year calling for China\u2019s ByteDance to sell TikTok\u2019s assets to an American company by early this year or face a nationwide ban, but Trump has repeatedly signed orders that have allowed TikTok to keep operating in the US as his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the social media company.\n\nMuch is still unknown about the actual deal in the works, but Trump said Thursday that Chinese leader Xi Jinping has approved it. Any major change to the popular video platform could have a huge impact on how Americans \u2014 particularly young adults and teenagers \u2014 consume information online.\n\nTikTok is seen in the app stores of an iPhone and Google Pixel on January 8, 2025. (CNN)\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington didn\u2019t immediately respond to an AP inquiry seeking confirmation that China has signed off on the proposed framework deal.\n\nAbout 43 per cent of US adults under the age of 30 say they regularly get news from TikTok, higher than any other social media app including YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, according to a Pew Research Center report published Thursday.\n\nTrump said in response to a question at a signing ceremony Thursday that he would make the American-controlled TikTok \u201c100 per cent MAGA\u201d if he felt he could, but he intends for \u201cevery philosophy, every policy\u201d to be \u201ctreated right.\u201d\n\nVice President JD Vance said the deal ensures that \u201cAmerican investors will actually control the algorithm\u201d that determines the content seen on the social media app. He said more information about the deal will be revealed in the coming weeks.\n\nWho will control the new TikTok venture?\n\nUnder the terms of the deal that have so far been revealed by the White House, the app will be spun off into a new US joint venture owned by a consortium of American investors \u2014 including Oracle and investment firm Silver Lake Partners.\n\nThough the details have yet to be finalised, the investment group\u2019s total stake in the new venture would be around 80 per cent, while ByteDance is expected to have a 20 per cent, or smaller, stake in the entity.\n\nThe board running the new platform would be controlled by US investors. ByteDance will be represented by one person on the board, but that individual will be excluded from any security matters or related committees.\n\nTikTok\u2019s new owners include many whose business or political interests are tied to Trump, including Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Rupert Murdoch, raising questions about whether political influence will be exerted into the platform.\n\nAlthough he stepped down as Oracle\u2019s CEO more than a decade ago, Ellison remains heavily involved as chairman and chief technology officer. Now 81, he could be in line to become a behind-the-scenes media power player, having already helped finance Skydance\u2019s recently completed $8 billion merger with Paramount, a deal engineered by his son, David.\n\nTrump also mentioned Dell founder Michael Dell will be an investor in the new venture.\n\nTikTok users could now \u201cget the editorial policies of the people who now have control of the company,\u201d said David Greene, civil liberties director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \u201dIt won\u2019t be 100 per cent MAGA. The question is how it will treat criticism of him and people he likes.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump listens to a question from a reporter as he speaks after signing an executive order regarding TikTok in the Oval Office at the White House, Thursday, Sept. 25, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (AP)\n\nWhat we know about the algorithm powering the platform\n\nThe recommendation algorithm that has steered millions of users into an endless stream of video shorts has been central in the security debate over TikTok. China previously maintained the algorithm must remain under Chinese control by law. But a US regulation that Congress passed with bipartisan support said any divestment of TikTok must mean the platform cut ties with ByteDance.\n\nAmerican officials previously warned the algorithm \u2014 which is a complex system of rules and calculations that platforms use to deliver content to your feed \u2014 is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape messaging on the platform in a way that\u2019s difficult to detect, but no evidence has ever been presented by US officials showing that China has attempted to do so.\n\nTrump, during his first term, signed an executive order attempting to ban the app if it didn\u2019t split off its US business, warning that TikTok\u2019s \u201cdata collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans\u2019 personal and proprietary information.\u201d\n\nTrump has since changed his approach to TikTok, often citing its role in helping him reach young voters in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAlthough the details remain unclear, a Trump administration official said that a licenced copy of the ByteDance created algorithm \u2014 retrained solely with US data \u2014 will power the new US version of the app. Administration officials say this retraining effort will nullify any risk of Chinese interference and influence.\n\nVance said \u201cwe wanted to keep TikTok operating\u201d but address security concerns so that \u201cAmericans can use TikTok but use it with more confidence than they had in the past.\u201d\n\nYoung people especially \u201creally wanted this to happen,\u201d Trump said during the signing ceremony.\n\nThat makes it unclear if the US version of TikTok will be a different experience than what users in the rest of the world are used to. Any noticeable changes made to a social media platform\u2019s service raises the risk of alienating its audience, said Jasmine Enberg, an analyst for the research firm eMarketer.\n\nIn a prime example of how a change of control can reshape a once-popular social media platform, billionaire Elon Musk triggered an almost immediate backlash after he completed his takeover of Twitter nearly three years ago.\n\nBut Musk made extremely visible changes, including changing its name to X, pulling back on its content moderation and adding exclusive features for paid subscribers. The changes that gradually occur while different data is fed into the US copy of TikTok\u2019s algorithm could be subtle and unnoticeable to most of its audience.\n\n\u201cSocial media is just as much about the culture as it is the technology, and how users will take to new ownership and potentially a new version of the app is still an open question,\u201d Enberg said.\n\nWhat motivated China to make this deal\n\nBeijing once called the demand that TikTok be spun off from its Chinese parent company an act of \u201crobbery,\u201d but Chinese officials changed their tune as the US-China trade war progressed.\n\nFollowing the announcement of a possible TikTok framework deal after US-China trade talks in Spain, some observers believed that China was able to extract concessions from the US on loosening trade restrictions in exchange for the TikTok deal. Others believe China was willing to do so to pave the way for a meeting between Xi and Trump.\n\nA TikTok deal would allow China to keep the ball rolling on trade negotiations, said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Centre. \u201cTikTok alone does not compare with the importance of an amicable US-China relations and the positive momentum that prevents many negative development from happening.\u201d\n\nDimitar Gueorguiev, associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, said TikTok has become an \u201cexpendable concession\u201d to Beijing because it is no longer a disruptive newcomer as it was five years ago.\n\nTikTok\u2019s highly personalised \u201cFor You\u201d video feed was seen as its secret sauce five years ago, when Trump first threatened to ban the app, but Instagram and other rivals now work similarly.\n\nGueorguiev argues that Beijing is more interested in retaining access to US technology and services, at least in the short term, so it can build up self-sufficiency in semiconductor, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.",

(Supplied)\n\nDo you have a story? Contact reporter April Glover at april.glover@nine.com.au\n\nDonovan told 9news.com.au \ufeffhe will need to delay his retirement after missing out on thousands of dollars in interest as he waited for his money to be returned.\n\n\"I've still got a mortgage... so it was all I had to retire on in another five or six years because I'm a chef and I can't keep working at this age,\" Donovan said.\n\n\"It's set me back three, four years at least.\"\n\nDonovan realised his $150,000 had been frozen when he went to transfer it back to his original fund \ufeffto claim disability insurance after tearing his rotator cuff.\n\nHe said he called MIML on September 5 but was told he \"didn't have any super left\".\n\nIt triggered a weeks-long nightmare for Donovan.\n\nThe hard-working chef is still recovering from his injury and wondered if he'd ever be able to retire.\n\n\"I left Bermagui, I was that depressed... I came up to Mudgee to see my best friend,\" Donovan said.\n\n\"\ufeffI've got friends in Mudgee, I worked here years ago. I could get some work here, do a couple of jobs here and there until my shoulder heals.\n\n\"I just couldn't believe it.

It's only $150,000 and without my interest, it would have been more.\n\n\"But there's people who have lost hundreds of thousands more and they're at retirement... these poor people.\"\n\nDonovan calculates he has lost between $20,000 and $30,000 in interest since Shield's collapse.\n\nMIML won't pay back any potentially earned interest and has emailed Donovan to say he will be handed back 100 per cent of the net capital he invested in Shield by Tuesday.\n\n\"I had no idea it was Shield at all,\" he added, explaining he didn't realise where MIML had invested his money.\n\n\"It's a huge relief. I was pretty down, man. I know it's not huge money, but it's all I had.\"\n\n\ufeffHe wants the superannuation industry to undergo urgent reform so no other Australian becomes entangled in another collapse.\n\nAccording to ASIC, around 5800 people invested their superannuation retirement savings into Shield.\n\n\"In many cases, this happened after people were contacted by lead generators and referred to financial advisers,\" ASIC said\n\n\"These advisers often told investors to roll over their existing superannuation balances into a choice superannuation fund available on a platform or to set up a self-managed super fund to facilitate investment into Shield.\"\n\nAn email sent from MIML to Donovan.

ASIC expects them to take active steps to monitor the funds they make available to members through their platforms.\"\n\nIn February 2024, ASIC halted new offers of investments in Shield.\n\n\"ASIC is investigating the circumstances surrounding Shield,\" the financial watchdog said.\n\n\"ASIC is investigating Keystone Asset Management Ltd (in liquidation) (the responsible entity for Shield), its directors and officers, the role of the superannuation trustees, certain financial advisers who recommended investors invest in Shield, the lead generators, and the research house which rated Shield.\"\n\nReaders seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or beyond blue on 1300 22 4636.",

        "text": "Brisbane have been one of the NRLW's powerhouses for the competition's entire history but after four seasons in the finals wilderness, the Queensland powerhouse is hell-bent on reclaiming some of their past glories.\n\nThe Broncos were the stand-outs in the NRLW's early years, losing just one match in the first three seasons as they romped to a trio of premiership titles.\n\nBut since then, it has been harder going. Brisbane consistently boasts one of the most talented squads in the game but they have yet to win a finals game since the 2020 grand final.\n\nIt is a four-year drought that is not just in the back of Brisbane's mind ahead of Sunday's preliminary final against Newcastle, it is the ultimate propulsive force.\n\nBrisbane were the gold standard in the NRLW's early years. (Getty Images: Cameron Spencer)\n\nA grand final clash between the Broncos and the Sydney Roosters, who take on Cronulla on Saturday night in the other prelim, has seemed inevitable all season but as veteran halfback Ali Brigginshaw points out, such a showdown has seemed inevitable in the past.\n\n\"Everyone tries to line us up with the Roosters but everyone said the same thing last year and we didn't make it. For us, it's not about anyone we're playing, it's about us,\" Brigginshaw said.\n\n\"That semifinal has been a huge hurdle for us and we haven't been able to overtake it.\n\n\"This group has achieved nothing. We've been together over three years and without silverware, there's not much to talk about because you can't talk about the games you should have won.\n\n\"We're focused on this semifinal more than anything. I think it'll be the toughest game we have because we have to get over that hurdle.\"\n\nBrigginshaw has played in each of Brisbane's failed finals campaigns in recent years, including last season's shock 14-0 semifinal loss to Cronulla.\n\nBrisbane were left wanting in a shock finals loss to Cronulla last year. (AAP: Dave Hunt)\n\nThis year's Broncos team is their most dominant in years. They lost just once in the regular season and come into the finals in red-hot form, having outscored their opponents by a combined 120-10 over the final three weeks of the regular season.\n\nBut Brigginshaw knows that counts for little now and the 35-year-old is hell bent on avoiding the pitfalls that have torpedoed Brisbane in the past.\n\n\"We might have taken shortcuts over the past few years and we learned you can't take those shortcuts,\" Brigginshaw said.\n\n\"The other team is doing everything they can to beat you and if you aren't doing all the one-percenters, it all adds up.\n\n\"If half the team isn't doing the right thing, you'll be found out.\"\n\nWhat could make the difference for Brisbane this time around is the form of fullback and captain Tamika Upton, who has scored 18 tries in 11 matches and seems certain to claim her second Dally M player of the year award.\n\nHer form on return to Brisbane after three seasons with Newcastle is clear evidence of her status as the best player in the world, given she leads the league in line breaks, try assists and line break assists.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nBrigginshaw played with Upton in her initial stint with Brisbane from 2019 to 2021 and has borne witness to the change first-hand.\n\n\"The way she articulates her game, the way she breaks the game down has changed,\" Brigginshaw said.\n\n\"I could ring her right now and she'd know who plays on what side, how they field kicks, what side they like to tackle with, everything.\n\n\"She works so hard during the week to get her body and mind ready.\n\n\"Tamika's brought a lot of leadership and she's taken that pressure off me. I've never felt so relaxed in the group because there's so much help from her and the rest of the leaders.\n\n\"That's where we've nailed it to get the most out of the group.\"",

        "text": "Brisbane must find a way to collectively make up for the loss of suspended lock Pat Carrigan or risk being exposed by Penrith in the middle of the park in the grand final qualifier.\n\nCarrigan has averaged 65 minutes a match in 24 games this year, and gets through a power of work on both sides of the ball.\n\nHis 158m and 36 tackles each game are just an aspect of his impressive resume.\n\nThe leadership of the Queensland and Australia powerhouse is invaluable, which is why coach Michael Maguire made him captain when regular skipper Adam Reynolds was injured.\n\nMaguire has named versatile Tyson Smoothy at number 13 to replace Carrigan at Lang Park on Sunday. Whether he runs out with the starting team is up for debate.\n\nSmoothy has averaged just 29 minutes through nine matches this season. If he runs on as per program, it won't be for a long stint. The 26-year-old does get through an average of 19 tackles each match, and rarely misses, but offers little in attack with just 26m per game.\n\nThe enduring legacy of the 2023 grand final Photo shows A man scores a try during a rugby league match, while another from the opposite team kneels behind. On Sunday, the Broncos and Panthers will face off in the finals for the first time since the 2023 grand final, but the memory of that night still hangs over both sides.\n\nThose stats alone show how much the rest of the pack will have to lift to cover for Carrigan.\n\nThe other three forwards named on the bench \u2014 Xavier Willison, Ben Talty and Kobe Hetherington \u2014 will be vital cogs to maintain the momentum of props Payne Haas and Corey Jensen when they take a break.\n\nHaas said they would all be expected to lift.\n\n\"I think it's just the work they've been putting in ever since pre-season. They all know their roles and know what's required of them,\" Haas said.\n\nThe way the champion prop addressed the topic suggested he was not prepared to accept anything but the best of his fellow forwards.\n\nWhen it comes to impact, the biggest asset for the Broncos against the Panthers is the return of giant forward Willison.\n\nThe 23-year-old had played every game of the season before breaking his right forearm against South Sydney in round 22.\n\nHis 23 tackles and 103m per match this season have been full of punch.\n\n\"I thought he started so well, and of course, to have that fracture in his arm didn't help,\" Haas said.\n\n\"But he's grown so much as a person, not just on the field but off the field as well.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"I think maturity has been a big part of him and being professional about how he goes about his business, so I've seen that come a long way. He's come on in spades. especially this year.\"\n\nWillison will wear a forearm guard and will no doubt be tested by the Panthers' pack.\n\nMeanwhile, Haas put to bed suggestions he was still struggling with an ankle he injured in the 29-28 qualifying-final win over Canberra a fortnight ago.\n\n\"I think I was just being soft. I am all good,\" Haas grinned.\n\n\"I think we've got the best physios and performance staff here. So they've been looking after me, and it's helped having that extra week off, and I am feeling fresh and ready to go.\"\n\nAAP",

(ABC South West Vic: Ted O'Connor)\n\n\"You wouldn't go to the local pub, you would come down to footy training and talk to everybody, because everyone comes down here and we just have a great time,\" he says.\n\nAllan watches his son Jacoby, whose flowing mullet bounces in the breeze.\n\nJacoby Lewis, far right, with the long mullet, alongside his under-11s teammates. (ABC South West Vic: Ted O'Connor)\n\nThat Saturday, Jacoby and his fellow under-11s Saints claim their first win of the season in front of a home crowd.\n\nThe boys and girls in the young team have an entertaining collection of nicknames such as \"Atlas\", \"Package\", \"Tonka\" and \"Banana\".\n\nAmusing nicknames are a key feature of the Saints under-11s football team. (ABC South West Vic: Ted O'Connor)\n\nThey sing the victory song in the change rooms surrounded by their parents, and Allan is right behind Jacoby, smiling proudly.\n\nAllan loves the atmosphere at home games.\n\n\"It's unreal,\" he says.\n\n\" We're like one big family. Everyone looks after each other. \"\n\nThe under 11s players receive awards after their first win of the 2025 season. (ABC South West Vic: Ted O'Connor)\n\nClub faces population decline\n\nStrategies to create a strong club culture are talked about at the highest levels of AFL football.\n\nThe current vibe at Branxholme has not come overnight.\n\nThe club has responded to the sort of demographic shifts that are causing other football clubs across Australia in small country towns to merge or fold, ending proud legacies stretching back generations.\n\nThe community's population has declined to just over 300 people at the last census.\n\nResidents blame changes in the farming sector, resulting in fewer workers.\n\nBranxholme's football oval sits on the fringe of the small town. (ABC South West Vic: Ted O'Connor)\n\nThere are only 10 children at the local primary school and neighbouring Wallacedale is little more than a name on the map.\n\nSaints turn around 'rough reputation'\n\nMore than a decade ago, the club at one point could not fill a reserves grade, and like other teams in the league, it had no junior footballers, who played in a separate competition.\n\nSaints football director David Simpson says back then, the club did not have a great reputation.\n\nDavid Simpson says the club's culture has improved a lot over the past decade. (ABC South West Vic: Ted O'Connor)\n\n\"We had a lot of rough guys around here and that didn't help attract players and Branxholme had a bad name,\" he says.\n\nIn 2024, the league amalgamated with a local junior competition and this allowed Branxholme, along with other clubs, to field under-age football teams, being under 11s, 14s and 17s.\n\nBranxholme Wallacedale and the Westerns say they have good numbers coming through their junior ranks. (ABC South West Vic: Ted O'Connor)\n\nIt posed a challenge for the Saints leaders: how to fill those teams with so few people in the community to draw from.\n\nThis season, the Saints do not have an under-17s football side, and their undermanned reserves have copped some hefty floggings.\n\nBut David and other leaders at the club are feeling positive about the future.\n\nHe says enough younger players are coming through the ranks to hopefully fill all junior football grades next year, priming the reserves and seniors for success in future years.\n\nConditions can sometimes be muddy in south-west Victoria. (ABC South West Vic: Ted O'Connor)\n\nThe football director says the club's strategies to improve its culture are paying off.\n\nThey include actively recruiting families, children and fun, popular coaches; making sure everyone \u2014 footballers and netballers \u2014 get along so it's not cliquey; and seeking out children who do not play football or are not having fun at other clubs.\n\n\"Great club people, that's really been our number one priority,\" David says.\n\n\"We make sure everyone gets along with everyone and that works so well.\n\n\" Things are going in the right direction. We've got the girls football team coming in next year as well, so that's more growth for the club. \"\n\nParents of the under-11s were proud of their first win for the year. (ABC South West Vic: Ted O'Connor)\n\nPlan to make people want to be at Branxholme\n\nAs the Saints go on the attack in the senior football game, club stalwart Leonie Bell yells, claps and bounces on her heels.\n\nShe organises a rodeo every year to raise much-needed funds for the Saints and is on the club's executive committee.\n\nLeonie Bell loves cheering on Branxholme's footballers and netballers. (ABC South West Vic: Ted O'Connor)\n\nShe says recruiting can be a \"struggle\" due to the lack of people in the area.\n\nSo the committee's goal is to make the club an appealing place for newcomers, not only from Branxholme and Wallacedale, but surrounding areas, including the much larger hub of Hamilton.\n\n\"The whole club had a plan: let's get everyone to like the club and want to be here and then moving forward, everything just progresses from there,\" she says.\n\n\" We're a very, very small community out in the middle of nowhere \u2026 so everyone just comes down here really for your social life and just to have a lot of fun and watch the sport. \"\n\nOpposition on similar journey\n\nBranxholme Wallacedale is playing Westerns, a football netball club based further south in Portland.\n\nKangaroos president Vicki Clayton is doing odd jobs in the opposition change rooms and she tells a similar story to her opponents.\n\nVicki Clayton says her club has also been improving its culture to make it an appealing place for families. (ABC South West Vic: Ted O'Connor)\n\nThe Kangaroos are also struggling to fill sides in junior football, but they, like the Saints, have improved their culture to make it more family-friendly.\n\nShe says good Auskick and under-11 numbers mean she is confident about a bright future.\n\n\"We have junior nights, our Thursday night dinners are a real family affair,\" she says.\n\n\"So it's about setting the right environment for families to choose Westerns as a club because they value that culture.\"\n\nInjured senior footballer Lachlan Holcombe donned a traditional goal umpiring outfit to entertain his friends at the Saints. (ABC News: Ted O'Connor)\n\nLittle actions that count\n\nStuart Craig provides support and advice to regional sporting clubs on building positive cultures and says those appealing environments are especially important for teams in areas suffering population decline.\n\nThe business manager at the non-profit organisation Sports Focus says there are many acts and gestures needed to create an attractive club vibe, which at their heart are about treating people with respect.\n\n\"What they're wanting is an environment where I can go and I feel welcomed, I've got a sense of belonging in this place because I'm respected,\" he says.\n\n\" I'm getting recognised for the contribution I'm making, so that's being valued. It's all those little things. \"\n\nThe club is trying to be a welcoming place for people from all walks of life. (ABC South West Vic: Ted O'Connor)\n\nAllan Lewis hopes that in the future, the club will be just as successful on the field as it is off.\n\n\"We're hoping that we keep all the younger players and they gradually move up to the 14s, 17s, ressies and seniors and get us a couple of premierships,\" he says.",

        "text": "For the eighteen AFL clubs around the country there are two main challenges \u2014 how to get good.\n\nAnd two \u2014 how to stay good.\n\nPlenty of teams hit that first bar, at least for a short period of time. The past six years have seen six different premiers and seventeen different teams making finals.\n\nIt's that second challenge that is far harder. Teams can often stretch their premiership window out, but the rubber band usually snaps back sooner or later \u2014 see the Hawks, Eagles, Tigers or Demons.\n\nBut the Cats might be the exception to the rule.\n\nLoading...\n\nGeelong has played in 15 of the past 22 preliminary finals and missed finals just three times in that period. In that time the Cats have been consistently good \u2014 frustratingly so if you are a fan of any other team.\n\nOscar Wilde once posited that it was his belief that \"consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative\".\n\nWilde may have been a century early to see coach Chris Scott not only shepherd the most consistently great team in the league, but also its most inventive.\n\n\"We do sort of shift things regularly in-season. We are big believers that the game changes and we want to change either with it or hopefully a little bit in front of it,\" Scott said last week.\n\nComing into this year's grand final, Geelong has put together the most impressive hot streak of any team this year.\n\nThey have won their past eight games in a row by at least 30 points.\n\nThat includes a victory against the Lions in the first week of finals.\n\nThat brilliance has delivered the Cats to the cusp of their eleventh flag. To stand upon the podium, they just need to continue to be their consistently dominating \u2014 and inventive \u2014 selves.\n\nMaximising their mistakes\n\nTo win games of Australian Football you've got to score more than the other team. Even Oscar Wilde might have known that.\n\nAnd in order to score, you've got to have the ball. And no team is better at winning the ball and using it effectively than Geelong.\n\nThe Cats lead the league from scoring from intercepts across the course of the season.\n\nTeams that have finished top three in total intercept scoring differential have won the flag in 18 of the past 19 seasons.\n\nWhile the Cats lead the league in that number (by some way), Brisbane are only ranked fifth across the year.\n\nAround two thirds of all scoring happens from intercepts league-wide, making it the most important phase of the game.\n\nThe Cats are adept at scoring from turnovers anywhere on the field but it's front half turnovers where they shine most. They average nearly six goals a game from intercepts they take forward of centre.\n\nA large part of that is down to the pressure that they apply in their forward half, with the Cats leading the league in tackles inside 50. Combined with a relatively high press, teams can get trapped in the Cats forward half.\n\nAs a consequence of this high defending method, they can be a little vulnerable to opposition transition getting through them.\n\nGeelong sits slightly below league average for conceding turnover scores from the defensive half. But given their high scoring this year \u2014 and their place in the grand final, that's a fair trade off.\n\nThe Cats don't have just one star defender to anchor around.\n\nInstead it's a team effort based on a common understanding of their principles and where they need to be.\n\nThe connectedness might help them overcome the loss of Tom Stewart for the Grand Final.\n\nSimply unpredictable\n\nFootball teams spend countless hours not only preparing themselves for a week's match, but also how the other team will play.\n\nWhile most will preach about playing their own game, there's always an eye towards working out what the other team will do.\n\nIt is in this aspect that Geelong really excels. Geelong confuses and confounds most opposition sides before, during and after games.\n\n\"If your strategy is 'hey, we want to be really flexible and move our team around' but you're moving good players away from their best position that's generally a bad idea,\" Scott mused after their preliminary final win.\n\n\"We just think when we move our players they're going from a good spot to another good spot.\"\n\nThis flexibility is key to a lot of what makes Geelong tick.\n\nA good example is how they use rucks. The Cats have utilised a three ruck set up in each game this year, with different players running through the roles. This is a unique arrangement in the AFL in 2025, with single primary rucks strongly predominant and no other side putting significant minutes into a third ruck.\n\nGeelong will spread the ruck load across different parts of the ground, with each ruck playing other roles.\n\nWhen Rhys Stanley, Mark Blicavs and Shannon Neale have played together it's Stanley that takes almost all centre bounces, with Blicavs filling a role more around the ground and Neale chopping out inside 50 and occasionally further up.\n\nScott has usually been hesitant to discuss his tactics with outsiders. When asked earlier this year about some of his strategic decisions the premiership coach was coy.\n\n\"In terms of the way we try to play \u2026 I don't talk about our tactics that much or the way we play,\" he said.\n\n\"Other coaches do, but I prefer to keep those things a little bit more to myself.\"\n\nNone of the Cats rucks chase the ground ball at ruck contests, instead looking to play a defensive role and spreading to provide extra options. Geelong's rucks will aggressively move themselves across the ground, particularly in the handover between the duties.\n\nThe solid performance in other roles of Blicavs and Neale means that the Cats don't lose anything by attacking the ruck in this way.\n\nIt's not only the ruck situation that sees Geelong perform switches.\n\nGeelong's key forwards will often work very high up the ground before doubling back, with hard running wings like Oliver Dempsey filling the space left behind.\n\nJeremy Cameron, Neale and Ollie Henry \u2014 who is named as an emergency \u2014 are all mobile and good ball users, allowing them to act as upfield targets and distributors targeting mismatches deeper up the ground.\n\nCameron works higher than any other major key position forward \u2014 something he's been able to balance alongside winning the Coleman Medal.\n\nIn the middle there are also shifts that throw opposition sides off kilter.\n\nPlayers who start outside the centre bounce group \u2014 like Shaun Mannagh \u2014 will often come inside for around the ground stoppages as ball winners.\n\nAlongside stronger bodies like Tom Atkins, this allows hard runners like Bailey Smith and Max Holmes to play their more natural roles slightly more outside, and enables them to get to post clearance contests a little easier.\n\nSometimes this hurts them in winning raw numbers of clearances, which has had them in trouble against Brisbane before this year.\n\nThe composition of this group can allow the Cats to play fast or slow, directly towards goal or with width. Geelong changes up their ball movement style as much as any team on a week to week basis \u2014 aside from their persistent preference to kick rather than handball.\n\nThe Cats have multiple players who can swing between roles and assignments to not only fill gaps, but cause problems for opposition sides.\n\nThat makes covering for the loss of a player like Tom Stewart marginally easier to bear.\n\n\"There's a little bit of a nod to our list management team who have done a terrific job,\" Scott said about the side's flexibility\n\nThis overall malleability \u2014 and depth \u2014 allows another wrinkle in the Cats' consistency arsenal.\n\nLate game heroics\n\nBeing a good football team means not just playing well in bursts, but across all four quarters. You'll often hear coaches congratulating their teams for playing out the game, or lamenting a lapse that cost them the game.\n\nCompeting across every minute is critical in a league as tight as the modern AFL.\n\n\"If you think that just (because you're) such a good team that you have it your way the whole game you're being really naive,\" Scott said last week.\n\nAcross the course of the year the ability to compete late in quarters and halves has shone through for Geelong, scoring heavily as quarters and halves run deep.\n\nTheir ability to switch personnel into different roles across the course of a game can deliver fresher legs where they are needed to gain an edge.\n\nNo side has been better in time-on this year, with the Cats playing right until the whistle.\n\nThis isn't just the case of fourth quarter blowouts either. If sides can't build up early leads Geelong has a tendency to blow teams out of the water.\n\nThis could be dangerous for Brisbane this week.\n\nCertain Cats players have a greater impact as the quarters wear on.\n\nPatrick Dangerfield can have explosive impact late with his powerful running away from contests.\n\nThe underrated Atkins gets even more involved than usual, and dangerous ball users Holmes and Tyson Stengle tend to get their hands on more footy around the ball as those around them tire.\n\nCameron also thrives late in quarters, with 37 of his 88 goals coming late in the term. His elite running ability for a tall forward pays dividends when opposition defenders are just waiting for the siren.\n\nPlaying to win again\n\nBeing consistently good is \u2026 well, good, but sometimes a little bit extra is required.\n\nIn this era of footy, making that extra step above the pack is harder than ever.\n\n\"If you sort of think about the way footy was years ago, the good teams \u2014 they'd have to have a bad season not to be in the top four,\" Scott said last week.\n\n\"Now you can have a really good season and miss the finals. So we've never been more respectful of the competition.\"\n\nBoth the Cats and Lions are vying for the right to become the first side this decade with two flags. The margins between the ultimate success and falling just short are very narrow \u2014 something both sides know intimately.\n\nIf the Cats can control the flow of the game and play right through all four quarters, they should be well on their way to winning their elusive third premiership of the Scott era.\n\nIf the consistency can hold one more week, then the Surf Coast should be happy all summer.\n\nABC Sport will be live blogging and calling all the action from the 2025 AFL grand final.

(Supplied: New Annual/Lee Illfield)\n\nLoudon commissioned two Newcastle theatre makers, playwright Ang Collins and director Janie Gibson of Whale Chorus theatre company, to create a site-specific work for her inaugural program.\n\n\"Tory wanted to pay homage to [what is] such an important place for so many Novocastrians,\" Collins says.\n\nCollins \u2014 whose play Spewy premiered at New Annual in 2023 \u2014 looked to past productions, like Small Metal Objects by Back to Back theatre company and Griffin Theatre's Green Park, that placed theatre in public settings.\n\nThe result was Meet Me at the Baths, a \"collection of dramatic vignettes\" based on stories Collins and Gibson collected from the community.\n\nCollins hopes the show inspires the audience to think about their own connection with the city.\n\nShe also invites viewers to pack their bathers.\n\n\" I hope they bring their togs and come and have a swim after \u2014 how many theatre shows can you see and then jump in the water? \"\n\n'Theatre makers collecting stories'\n\nWhen it came to persuading the locals to share their stories, Collins and Gibson took their cue from another crowdsourced work: Trent Dalton's 2021 book Love Stories, based on conversations with strangers (and recently adapted for the stage).\n\nIn his pursuit of romantic tales, Dalton famously set up a table on a Brisbane street corner with an Olivetti typewriter and a sign reading: \"Sentimental writer collecting love stories.\"\n\nCollins and Gibson \"pilfered\" Dalton's idea and, a few times a week over two months, they set up their own table at the Newcastle baths with a similar sign that read: '\"Theatre-makers collecting Baths stories, come have a chat.\"\n\nAs they observed the waves of people coming and going from the baths, they came to recognise the many regulars who visited every day.\n\nCollins also put a call out on a local Facebook group dedicated to the baths with more than 27,000 members.\n\nThe response from the community was enthusiastic.\n\n\"Between them, we had so many stories \u2014 we could create five plays, not just one out of the stories we collected,\" Collins says.\n\n\"The Newcastle theatre scene is small but mighty,\" Collins says. (Supplied: New Annual/Lee Illfield)\n\nAs they listened to the multitude of stories, some common themes appeared.\n\nMany touched on the big milestones of life: birth, death and marriage.\n\n\"People get their ashes scattered at the baths,\" Collins says.\n\n\"We [heard another story about] a wedding ring that slipped off the groom's finger on the wedding day \u2026 and dropped into the baths.\"\n\nSearchers wearing snorkels spent hours scouring the bottom of the pool until a group of teenage boys finally found the ring.\n\nMany of the stories also touch on what Collins describes as \"the magic of everyday life\".\n\n\"There were stories of rainbows at night, phosphorescence, first kisses \u2014those little moments that are blips that emerge out of your everyday routine,\" she says.\n\nA tapestry of everyday life\n\nCollins and Gibson whittled down the many stories they heard to a handful \u2014 a difficult task in itself \u2014 which they then fictionalised for the play.\n\nThe lost wedding ring makes an appearance, as do characters inspired by familiar faces at the baths who locals might recognise.\n\nThe family of a man, a longtime regular who recently died, gave the theatre makers their blessing to use his story in the production.\n\nCollins describes the show as a \"tapestry reflecting everyday life \u2026 at the Newcastle baths. It's like a short story collection that uses the real-life ocean baths as a stage\".\n\nThe show performed in hospital Photo shows Dad of patient looks through an octogon shape beaming at the camera A South Australian theatre group has come up with an innovative way to change the environment for hospital patients: stage a performance at the end of their bed.\n\nThe audience will hear the dialogue and the accompanying soundscape, designed by Liesl Pieterse (The Newsreader), through headphones.\n\nThe effect is like \"eavesdropping into these people's lives\", Collins says.\n\nAlso adding to the atmosphere is the general public, who will be able to use the facility as usual during the show's run.\n\nClosing such an important community space was never an option, Collins says.\n\n\"While the show is going on, people will be able to swim and tan and do all the things that they normally do \u2014 it's just that if you buy a ticket, that gets you a set of headphones which will be like a magic pair of goggles that you'll slip on to get this other deeper side of the story.\"\n\nThe unusual setting has required adjustments from the cast of four: Barney Donaghy, Jim Lawson, Katia Molino and Stephanie Rochet.\n\nThree days at Australia's oldest arts festival Photo shows On stage, Meher Pavri in a sun headdress sings. Neil D'Souza and Anaka Maharaj-Sandhu stand behind her. Over a weekend at Perth Festival, we're given a glimpse behind the scenes, inspiring empathy and defiant hope.\n\n\"The actors have found that if you act like you act in a theatre, which is to project [your voice] all the way to the back of the theatre, you look like a bit of a goose,\" Collins says.\n\n\"They say it's much more comparable to screen acting, where every little, tiny movement matters.\n\n\"They'll be mic'd up and you'll be able to hear every word they say quite intimately through the headphones, [but] they don't have to ham it up as much.\n\n\"In fact, if they do that, which is something we found in creative development, some people are like, 'What are you doing?' or 'Are you OK?' And then they have to say, 'Oh, no, I'm an actor in the show'.\"\n\nA public space for all\n\nHailing from a \"multi-generational Novocastrian family\", Collins has visited Newcastle's ocean baths all her life.\n\nHer parents would take her and her sister to the baths and the adjacent Map of the World pool when they were small.\n\n\"Saltwater is our family's norm,\" she says.\n\nABC Radio National's Top 100 Books of the 21st Century Top 100 Books is Radio National's new annual countdown where we hand over the reins to you to vote for your favourite books, and then we celebrate the Top 100 in a big weekend broadcast!\n\nWith urban areas increasingly dedicated to consumerism, public spaces like the baths are becoming increasingly rare and all the more valuable.\n\n\"Everyone is allowed in; it's free. People from all walks of life are there,\" Collins says.\n\n\"I've always felt like I belonged at the baths.\"\n\nThis year, the baths are also the venue for SOAK: Live at the Baths, five nights of free live music performances curated by musician and producer Tim Levinson.\n\nCollins says the New Annual festival, now in its fifth year, presents an invaluable opportunity for local creatives, many of whom relocate to Sydney and beyond to pursue careers in the arts, to perform at home.\n\n\"I don't think I can overstate the importance of New Annual,\" Collins says.\n\n\" Having an industry-standard major festival headline commission as an independent playwright \u2014 that is something I would never have thought possible in Newcastle. \"\n\nShe also applauds Loudon's artistic vision.\n\n\"In Australia, new writing isn't as valued as it could and should be, so to have Tory back it and take risks and celebrate experimentation and local stories \u2014 I think that's of national importance.\"\n\nMeet Me at the Baths is at Newcastle Ocean Baths, as part of New Annual festival, from September 27 to October 4.",

(ABC Gippsland: Madeleine Stuchbery)\n\nWhat is regenerative agriculture?\n\nAn upbringing in rural Myrtleford, in Victoria's north-east, informed Mr Rinaudo's choice to study agronomy after school, and his egalitarian approach to agriculture.\n\nAlong with his wife, he moved to Niger in the 1980s.\n\nRegenerative farming key to food security Photo shows A landscape of green grass with chickens roaming free and gumtrees in the background.

(Supplied)\n\nRegenerative agriculture is a farming practice where one farms with natural systems and the environment, such as increasing natural biodiversity, rotating stock through paddocks, and improving soil function.\n\nThe movement has been gaining momentum in Australia in recent years, with changing climatic conditions creating dynamic circumstances for many farmers across the nation.\n\nGlobal soil degradation a major threat Photo shows Two men stand on the edge of a huge erosion site in Africa.

It won't affect our PBS.\n\n\"There's some suggestions that PBS could use some efficiency gains, but this is not going to bring them out. That's going to come about from our own processes.\"\n\nShe said the details were \"still hazy\".\n\n\"I think an announcement on Truth Social really doesn't give us all of the details that we potentially need,\" she told ABC News Channel.\n\n\"Certainly not the details we need to make some big financial decisions.\"\n\nTariffs imposed on heavy vehicles, kitchen cabinetry\n\nMr Trump said the US would also impose 25 per cent tariffs on heavy-duty trucks and 50 per cent tariffs on kitchen cabinets.\n\nHe said the new heavy-duty truck tariffs were to protect manufacturers from \"unfair outside competition\" and support locally manufactured vehicles.\n\n\"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,\" Trump posted.\n\nMr Trump also said he would start charging a 50 per cent tariff on bathroom vanities and a 30 per cent tariff on upholstered furniture next week.\n\nThe new tariffs on kitchen, bathroom and some furniture were because of huge levels of imports that were hurting local manufacturers, Trump said.\n\n\"The reason for this is the large scale 'FLOODING' of these products into the United States by other outside Countries,\" he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nTrump has long said that tariffs are the key to forcing investment in domestic factories.\n\nBut experts warn tariffs will drive up inflation.\n\n\"We have begun to see goods prices showing through into higher inflation,\" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned in a recent news conference.\n\nHe added that higher costs for goods accounted for \"most\" or potentially \"all\" of the increase in inflation levels this year.\n\nThe consumer price index has already risen to 2.9 per cent in the US in the past 12 months, up from an annual pace of 2.3 per cent in April when Trump first launched a set of import taxes.\n\nBut Mr Trump disagrees inflation has occurred.\n\n\"There's no inflation,\" he told reporters Thursday.\n\n\"We're having unbelievable success.\"\n\nABC/Wires",

        "text": "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order that he says will allow TikTok to continue operating in the country in a way that meets national security concerns laid out by the law.\n\nMuch is still unknown about the actual deal in the works, but Mr Trump said Chinese leader Xi Jinping had approved it.\n\nAny major change to the popular video platform could have a huge impact on how Americans \u2014 particularly young adults and teenagers \u2014 consume information online.\n\nMr Trump has frequently referenced TikTok's role in helping him reach voters during his 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden signed legislation last year calling for China's ByteDance to sell TikTok's assets to an American company by early this year or face a nationwide ban, but Mr Trump repeatedly signed orders that allowed TikTok to keep operating in the US as his administration tried to reach an agreement for the sale of the social media company.\n\nTrump says China's Xi approved TikTok deal Photo shows A man with blonde hair in a suit shakes hand with a man with black hair in a suit The deal would transfer TikTok's US assets to US owners from ByteDance, according to sources familiar with the negotiations.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington has not yet provided confirmation that China has signed off on the proposed framework deal.\n\nAbout 43 per cent of US adults under the age of 30 say they regularly get news from TikTok, higher than any other social media app including YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, according to a Pew Research Centre report published on Thursday.\n\nWho will control the new TikTok venture?\n\nUnder the terms of the deal that have so far been revealed by the White House, the app will be spun off into a new US joint venture owned by a consortium of American investors \u2014 including Oracle, a software company, and investment firm Silver Lake Partners.\n\nAlthough the details have yet to be finalised, the investment group's total stake in the new venture is expected to be around 80 per cent, while ByteDance is expected to have a 20 per cent or smaller share.\n\nThe board running the new platform would be controlled by US investors, with one representative from ByteDance, but that individual would be excluded from any security matters or related committees.\n\nTikTok's new owners include many whose business or political interests are tied to Mr Trump, including Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Rupert Murdoch, raising questions about whether political influence will be exerted on the platform.\n\nLachlan Murdoch involved in possible TikTok deal, Trump says Photo shows A young man and an older man sit together in sporting stands The deal would see TikTok's American assets transferred from China's ByteDance to American owners.\n\nAlthough he stepped down as Oracle's chief executive more than a decade ago, Mr Ellison remains heavily involved in its operations, as chairman and chief technology officer.\n\nNow 81, he could be in line to become a behind-the-scenes media power player, having already helped finance Skydance's recently completed $8 billion merger with Paramount, a deal engineered by his son, David.\n\nMr Trump also mentioned tech giant Dell founder Michael Dell will be an investor in the new venture.\n\nWhat about the algorithm?\n\nThe recommendation algorithm that has steered millions of users into an endless stream of video shorts has been central in the security debate over TikTok.\n\nChina previously maintained the algorithm must remain under Chinese control by law.\n\nBut a US regulation that Congress passed with bipartisan support said any divestment of TikTok must mean the platform cuts ties with ByteDance.\n\nAmerican officials previously warned that the algorithm \u2014 which is a complex system of rules and calculations that platforms use to deliver content to your feed \u2014 is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape messaging on the platform in a way that's difficult to detect, but no evidence has ever been presented by US officials showing that China has attempted to do so.\n\nDuring his first term, Mr Trump signed an executive order attempting to ban the app if it didn't split off its US business, warning at the time that TikTok's \"data collection threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans' personal and proprietary information\".\n\nAlmost half (43 per cent) of US adults under 30 say they use TikTok as a source of news. (ABC News: Phoebe Pin)\n\nMr Trump has since changed his approach to TikTok, often citing its role in helping him reach young voters in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAlthough the details remain unclear, a Trump administration official said that a licensed copy of the ByteDance-created algorithm \u2014 retrained solely with US data \u2014 will power the new US version of the app, which they say will nullify any risk of Chinese interference and influence.\n\nYoung people especially \"really wanted this to happen\", Mr Trump said during the signing ceremony.\n\nThat makes it unclear if the US version of TikTok will be a different experience than what users in the rest of the world are used to.\n\nJasmine Enberg, an analyst for the research firm eMarketer, said that making noticeable changes to a social media platform's service risked alienating its audience.\n\nIn a prime example of how a change of control can reshape a once-popular social media platform, billionaire Elon Musk triggered an almost immediate backlash after he completed his takeover of Twitter nearly three years ago.\n\nMr Musk made extremely visible changes to the platform, including changing its name to X, pulling back on its content moderation and adding exclusive features for paid subscribers.\n\nThe changes that gradually occur while different data is fed into the US copy of TikTok's algorithm could be subtle and unnoticeable to most of its audience.\n\n\"Social media is just as much about the culture as it is the technology, and how users will take to new ownership and potentially a new version of the app is still an open question,\" Ms Enberg said.\n\nWhat motivated China to make this deal?\n\nBeijing once called the demand that TikTok be spun off from its Chinese parent company an act of \"robbery\", but Chinese officials changed their tune as the trade war with the US progressed.\n\nFollowing the announcement of a possible TikTok framework deal after US\u2013China trade talks in Spain, some observers believed that China was able to extract concessions from the US on loosening trade restrictions in exchange for the TikTok deal.\n\nOthers believe China was willing to do so to pave the way for a meeting between Mr Xi and Mr Trump.\n\nA TikTok deal would allow China to keep the ball rolling on trade negotiations, said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center.\n\n\"TikTok alone does not compare with the importance of amicable US\u2013China relations and the positive momentum that prevents many negative developments from happening.\"\n\nWhat we know about how the under-16s social media ban will work Photo shows A graphic showing a hand holding a phone. It is superimposed on a drawing of Australia and surrounded by social media apps Australia is months away from implementing its world-first social media ban for teens. But questions still remain around how the restrictions will work.\n\nDimitar Gueorguiev, associate professor of political science at Syracuse University, said TikTok had become an \"expendable concession\" to Beijing because it was no longer a disruptive newcomer as it was five years ago.\n\nTikTok's highly personalised \"For You\" video feed was seen as its secret sauce five years ago, when Mr Trump first threatened to ban the app, but Instagram and other rivals now work similarly.\n\nDr Gueorguiev argued that Beijing was more interested in retaining access to US technology and services, at least in the short term, so it could build up self-sufficiency in semiconductor, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.\n\n\"That is the front line of technological competition,\" he said.\n\n\"TikTok, by contrast, is a maturing consumer app with diminishing strategic weight.\"\n\nAP",

He was in and out of foster and residential care.\n\nThere were spates of reunification with his mother, before her drug use forced him, as a child, to call Child Safety and ask to be taken back in.\n\nNow in his 20s, the quietly spoken Mr Kennedy this week told a room full of lawyers in Cairns about his time in care, as part of the regional hearings of the Child Safety Commission of Inquiry.\n\nIn his ambition to \"leave no stone unturned\", Commissioner Paul Anastassiou KC has heard from foster carers, kin carers and as child safety workers running residential homes.\n\nIn the third and final week of sittings in Cairns, Mr Kennedy explained how at the age of 10 he was put in 15 to 20 different placements in as many days.\n\n\"Especially when you're only at houses for one or two days, and then you're just moved around, you start to feel a bit like cargo,\" he said.\n\nHe said the lack of stability continued to impact him and his sense of self-worth.\n\n\"When you're at 20 different houses in as many days, you start to feel like, 'OK, well, nobody wants me', so then you just shut off emotionally, because there's no point getting attached,\" he said.\n\nFor several years, Mr Kennedy lived in a home that some of the commission lawyers referred to as a \"foster farm\".\n\nSharing a room with four to five other children, he said they were given different food to the parents and forced to work for one of the carer's lawn care businesses without pay.\n\nPaul Anastassiou KC sat for three weeks of hearings in Cairns. (AAP: Darren England)\n\n\"It was almost an expectation that you would help; otherwise, you know, you'd fear not getting fed,\" he said.\n\nHe said the father would drink while the children worked, and the adults would throw empty soft drink cans at them if they were annoyed.\n\n\"We were never treated as children \u2026 probably more of an annoyance,\" he said.\n\nAfter several more placements lasting from a few weeks to two years, at 14, Mr Kennedy said he finally landed a spot with a foster carer who gave him the stability and care he craved.\n\nIt was the one thing he urged the commission to prioritise.\n\n\"If possible, don't just keep moving us around,\" he said.\n\nMedical delays\n\nFoster carers and Child Safety officers have described a fraught and strained system, made up of a \"labyrinth\" of meetings and bureaucracy and vulnerable children losing at every turn.\n\nMultiple foster carers outlined the distress caused by lengthy delays in getting children access to medical care.\n\nManagers of multiple residential care homes in the Far North gave evidence during the inquiry. (ABC Far North: Holly Richardson)\n\nFoster carer Gayle McLaren told the inquiry she cared for a child who needed 14 fillings and five adult teeth removed.\n\nEach child is allocated $1,100 every two years for dental care, and that had already been spent on previous dental work.\n\nMs McLaren said Child Safety told her she had to take the child to a public dentist, which meant a four to six-month waiting list for treatment.\n\n\"This child is needing Panadol, ibuprofen most days and nights because she's in pain,\" she said.\n\nShe also described attempting to get specialised treatment for a child with scabies. Eventually, she paid for the dermatologist herself.\n\nA kinship carer, who could not be named for legal reasons, said he was still waiting, after more than 18 months, for a child in his care to see a paediatrician.\n\nHe said he would like to see children assessed as soon as possible when they entered the care system.\n\nAccess to timely medical care was an issue repeated by multiple foster and kin carers and former foster children. (ABC News: Curtis Rodda)\n\nAnglicare North Queensland chief executive Liz Colahan told the commission that in her years working for various organisations in Child Safety, the number of different agencies and people involved had ballooned.\n\nShe said this had inadvertently created more cracks for children to fall through.\n\nResidential care homes\n\nThe care children receive in residential care homes \u2014 where multiple children are housed in a building, with a team of staff rotating in \u2014 also came under scrutiny.\n\nRetired manager at Child Safety Innisfail Ralph Laksa said residential care should feel like a child's home but acknowledged many did not meet that standard.\n\nThe commission held hearings around Cairns and is expected to hold further sessions in regional Queensland. (ABC News: Brendan Mounter)\n\n\"I've seen residentials where they've taken the cupboard doors off the kitchen, they're replaced all the crockery with plastic plates, removed photos for them being thrown around,\" he said.\n\n\" They're just concrete besser block homes with no love, no care, no emotion in the home. \"\n\nThe Cairns hearings are expected to wrap up today with further hearings yet to be announced.",

        "text": "Former Arsenal-contracted player Billy Vigar has died aged 21 after sustaining a \"significant brain injury\" while playing for Chichester City last weekend.\n\nVigar was injured in an Isthmian League match at Wingate and Finchley, leading to the game's abandonment after 13 minutes.\n\n\"After sustaining a significant brain injury last Saturday, Billy Vigar was put in an induced coma. On Tuesday, he needed an operation to aid any chances of recovery. Although this helped, the injury proved too much for him and he passed away on Thursday morning,\" a statement from the seventh-tier Chichester read.\n\n\"The responses to the original update show how much Billy was thought of and loved within the sport. His family are devastated that this has happened whilst he was playing the sport that he loved.\"\n\nVigar joined Arsenal's academy as a 14-year-old in 2017, before signing a professional contract in 2022. He was loaned to Derby and Eastbourne Borough before joining Hastings United in 2024. He linked up with Chichester at the start of this season.\n\n\"Everyone at Arsenal Football Club is deeply sorry to hear of the tragic passing of Chichester City forward and former Arsenal academy player, Billy Vigar,\" a statement from Arsenal read.\n\n\"Billy joined our academy on schoolboy terms aged 14, after being scouted at his home town club Hove Rivervale FC and excelled as a striker at Hale End, scoring 17 goals in his debut season.\n\n\"As well as his significant talent, Billy will always be remembered for his love of the game, pride at representing our football club \u2014 he once called the day he was spotted by our scouts as 'the most important of his life' \u2014 and a character beloved by teammates and coaches alike.\n\n\"Our deepest condolences go out to the Vigar family and his many friends at this extremely difficult time.\"",

I knew that everyone was talking about it. And I was like, this should have been like a year ago, but whatever.\u201d What came after that was even better: a goal, in the third minute of stoppage time, to help seal a 3-1 victory. Scrappy as it was, it won\u2019t find a home on Kerr\u2019s highlight reel - unlike the \u201cout of body experience\u201d of scoring that goal against England at the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup - but it was momentous all the same, and not just because it was her 100th for the club. Sam Kerr enters the fray after \u2026 well, too long on the sidelines. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI was relieved, and just kind of like, laughing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think like the response that the girls gave me was really nice and melted my heart \u2026 [and] I just wanted to thank the Chelsea fans, because throughout these last few months, they\u2019ve been so supportive of me. Some of them probably lost a little bit of faith in, like, me or forgot what I could do on the pitch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had so many people over the last year say, \u2018Oh, she\u2019ll never get back to what she was.\u2019 Loading \u201cIt felt nice to be able to remind people. I don\u2019t even need a whole game. I can score an important goal in 20 minutes, whether it\u2019s my first game back or not.\u201d The comeback trail for Kerr was about twice as long as it should be for an ACL injury; it was a \u201cpretty crap\u201d experience, she said, but one that was put into perspective by the arrival of her first child, Jagger, with partner Kristie. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I was sitting off the park, and I was training and having a great old time. It was doctor\u2019s appointment after doctor appointment, flying here, flying there, trying to fix my knee,\u201d she said.\n\nLoading \u201cI felt like every time \u2026 say I had six good weeks, then I\u2019d have two really bad weeks. I had maybe like seven or eight setbacks. Especially when it got to the pointy end of [ast] season, it\u2019s tough to not be involved in those games. As a competitor, you just want to be out there, and you just want to show people what you\u2019re made of. And that was really hard for me. \u201cThe good part of it was you play football for so long, you kind of think it\u2019s your identity and it\u2019s who you are. But with the time off, I got to spend more time with Kristie. We got to go home, see my family. We had Jags. So there was things that happened that really kept me going. Now I have a different look on football, and I don\u2019t hang so much of my life on it, I guess.\u201d Kerr turned 32 earlier this month, and though that might suggest she\u2019s in the twilight of her career, she insists that she\u2019s not. The impending Women\u2019s Asian Cup in Australia gives her another marquee event on home soil to look forward to, but her outlook stretches well beyond that, and even the next World Cup in 2027. In a recent interview with Nine, she said she has \u201cway more in my locker than one more\u201d World Cup - but when the time comes that she does retire, a career as a coach could beckon.",

A photo of Vittoria and Claudia at the end of their journey adorns the entrance to the latest exhibition to open at the WA Maritime Museum. From Nonna with Love: Stories of Tradition and Triumph charts the tales of the Italian migrants who came to Western Australia between the early 1900s to the 1970s \u2013 and, more specifically, the matriarchs who became the backbones of those communities which helped shape the identity of Perth, Fremantle, and the broader state. Ahead of its time: Anne Ferrari, left, with an early coffee roasting machine. The exhibition opens on Saturday, but many of the nonnas featured, and their families, got an early look on Wednesday during a tour with curator Nella Fitzgerald. Among the personal stories told through more than 100 objects on display are famous names in sport, politics \u2013 and food.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnne Ferrari, whose father John Re was behind Northbridge\u2019s famous The Re Store, tells this masthead of the early days of selling coffee roasted and ground in-store \u2013 ahead of its time, given the espresso-driven cafe culture which later flourished in Perth.

Pizzale\u2019s daughter, Carla Caravella, was overcome with emotion when she first saw the display. \u201cMrs Ferrari and mum lived a different life, because they were working, they were in the businesses working, and they worked long, hard hours, and so they weren\u2019t in the community socializing quite as much,\u201d Caravella says. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to have friends,\u201d Pizzale laughs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was too busy, and I raised four children in the Capri Restaurant.\u201d \u201cThis has brought so much emotion forward, because it is such an important part of our history \u2026 and it honours all these ladies who are part of this exhibition, because they\u2019ve always been in the background, quietly, just keeping everything going,\u201d Caravella says.

The motivation for From Nonna With Love came from conversations Fitzgerald had with her mother about life in Italy during World War II, and the decision to migrate to Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to my mother, Angela. But in that tribute, is a tribute to every Nonna and great biznona that is here, both in Italy, Australia and around the world,\u201d she says. \u201cIt also tells the story of extraordinary Italian women who migrated here to Australia \u2026 it tells their stories of perseverance, belief and the love that they had to build a family and a wonderful future here for them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

In a classic sliding doors moment, Jones revealed the day he attended Red Bend Catholic College to watch trials for the Southern Country team. The best 17 players from that day would head to Sydney to try their luck at making the NSW Combined Catholic Colleges team. Selectors spotted Jones and asked him to help with proceedings.

Who knows, maybe Yeoy would have still been playing in Dubbo. \u201cHe was on the bench for his team. He was wearing the No.14. But he was tall, mobile, tough, and skilful. \u201cThe selectors asked me at the end of the day what I thought. They were like, \u2018What about this fella?\u2019, and I was like, \u2018Yep\u2019, then I asked, \u2018What happened to the No.14?\u2019. They said, \u2018We didn\u2019t pick him\u2019. I said, \u2018You better put him back in\u2019. He was the only bloke I liked all day.\u201d Yeo made the cut and went to Sydney, but missed out on the NSW CCC team.

There were also a couple of players Jones missed, like the day he was sent to the Confraternity Carnival, a popular schoolboys tournament in Queensland, in the early 1990s, with the simple instruction of landing one signature. He wanted two and begged Phil Gould, who was then working with the Panthers, only to be told to stick with one. Wendell Sailor is one who \u2018got away\u2019 from the Panthers.

Yeo\u2019s father, Justin, recalled his boy \u201cbeing OK, but never a standout, and certainly never the first kid picked\u201d. \u201cHe was a bit like he is now, always strong, with little difference between his best game and worst game,\u201d Yeo snr said. \u201cMost of the time, he looked like another player. I remember he was playing SG Ball, and Ivan Cleary walked into the box at the very moment Isaah made a break and did something special. The coaches told Ivan, \u2018that\u2019s Isaah Yeo\u2019. Isaah Yeo led the Kangaroos at last year\u2019s Pacific Championships. Credit: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou often wonder if things would have been different had Ivan not walked into the box at that very moment, or looked up to see what Isaah was doing at that exact time. \u201cI teach at a school in Mudgee, and I still tell the kids how you need to make the most of every moment and opportunity; if you get an opportunity, it\u2019s up to you what you do with it.\u201d The kid wearing the No.14 jersey that day in 2012 \u2013 and who made a break when Cleary took a peek \u2013 has become one of the most influential forwards in the game. The attributes he provides are a large part of the reason Penrith can defeat Brisbane and give themselves a shot at five straight premierships next Sunday. Yeo is admired on both sides of the border, with Cameron Smith \u2013 the Melbourne, Queensland, and Australian legend who finished with 430 NRL games \u2013 praising the 30-year-old\u2019s durability. \u201cWhen you look at his last five years, Isaah has barely missed a game of footy,\u201d Smith said.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "The football world has universally lauded Dangerfield, at age 35, for his spectacular display last week against Hawthorn, including 31 disposals, three goals, 20 contested possessions, 13 score involvements, nine inside 50s and six centre clearances. It was the highest-rating preliminary final performance since Champion Data started keeping records. Coach Chris Scott insisted afterwards that they don\u2019t wrap the champion veteran in cotton wool and unleash him in September, but there must be some truth in that with his management in his 18th season. Dangerfield enhanced his legacy with a masterful performance in the Cats\u2019 preliminary final win over Hawthorn. Credit: Getty Images The best-on-ground performance, which propelled Geelong into their seventh grand final since 2007, even triggered a discussion between his teammates about where \u201cPat\u201d stacks up among the AFL\u2019s modern giants. Max Holmes believes Dangerfield is \u201ceasily\u201d inside the top five, while Shaun Mannagh has him on the podium \u2013 and joked that the man himself would probably place himself there, too.\n\nLoading \u201cGary Ablett jnr is a clear No.1, I\u2019d say,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cI honestly want to put Patty second, but I know people scream that \u2018Dusty\u2019 [Dustin Martin] is better, and \u2018Buddy\u2019 [Lance Franklin] is up there as well. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to rank those players, but I think \u2018Danger\u2019 is in that top five, for sure. He\u2019s incredible to play alongside, and I guess that\u2019s a perk of being at Geelong. There are stars everywhere who you can take a lot of wisdom from.\u201d Bowes \u2013 who chose to join the Cats in large part because of Dangerfield\u2019s involvement \u2013 agrees with Mannagh, pointing to his 359 games, eight All-Australian selections and four club champion awards across two clubs, as well as him winning the 2016 Brownlow Medal and playing in the 2022 premiership. \u201cThe only thing missing on his resume is being captain in a grand final and winning the premiership, so hopefully, we can tick that off for him,\u201d Bowes said.\n\nEmerging midfielder Jhye Clark, the Cats\u2019 super sub in the preliminary final, has a different measure for Dangerfield. After entering the match when Tom Stewart was concussed before quarter-time, Clark had a front-row seat to Dangerfield\u2019s extraordinary feats. \u201cIt\u2019s so sick. He\u2019s one of a kind,\u201d Clark said. Jhye Clark (left) celebrates Geelong\u2019s preliminary final win with Dangerfield. Credit: Getty Images \u201cHe just runs straight through everyone, and when you watch him play \u2013 you just want to run through a brick wall. He\u2019s so inspiring for the whole team, and I\u2019d be very scared of playing against him.\u201d Don\u2019t mess with Danger\u2019s play list\n\nShannon Neale was yet to make his AFL debut when he walked into the player gym at Kardinia Park one day in the 2022 pre-season. Zach Tuohy, Rhys Stanley and Dangerfield were already in there. Country music was blasting from the speakers, which a then-19-year-old Neale was unimpressed with before he made a mistake he will never forget. Dangerfield has formed a close bond with Shannon Neale (second from right) after an inauspicious start. Credit: Getty Images Without a moment of hesitation, the big forward from Perth pressed the \u201cskip\u201d button. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t change the music! You can\u2019t do that!\u2019,\u201d Dangerfield crossly told Neale, who initially laughed, thinking his reaction was a joke.\n\nLoading \u201cBut he said, \u2018I\u2019m dead serious\u2019 and he\u2019s got the finger pointing at me, and everything,\u201d Neale recalled. \u201cI walked out of the gym, and I almost left the club that afternoon. About 20 minutes later, he sends me a message, and he\u2019s like, \u2018Mate, I am extremely sorry, the [summer] heat got to me \u2013 it\u2019s fine\u2019. \u201cIt took me a couple of weeks to look him in the eyes again. He wasn\u2019t the captain at the time, but obviously, he\u2019s a leader. He\u2019s such a figure. It\u2019s Patrick Dangerfield. Anything that happens like that; you think you\u2019re done.\u201d Neale sheepishly shared the Dangerfield story, which he thinks might get him in trouble, but he wanted to make the point that it was a sliding doors moment for their relationship, which was limited at the time. They are only two lockers apart, now sit alongside one another in team meetings, and have formed a close bond.\n\n\u201cI can ask him for advice, and I feel very comfortable approaching him about anything,\u201d Neale said. \u201cHe\u2019s super witty, and loves a laugh. I think he\u2019s really enjoying his footy. He\u2019s relaxed, and enjoying where he\u2019s at, and certainly, our friendship has blossomed since that moment.\u201d Another speaker-related Dangerfield story emerged last Friday night. It was all love between Shaun Mannagh and Dangerfield last week. Credit: AFL Photos The evergreen skipper was controlling the tunes again pre-match against the Hawks, but made the left-field choice of classical music. This time it wasn\u2019t just Neale who took umbrage, prompting Dangerfield to relent and change to a different song, Kenny Loggins\u2019 Danger Zone.",

Walters has also confirmed Roosters flyer Mark Nawaqanitawase will be considered for an Ashes berth, with his decision to move back to rugby at the end of 2026 having no bearing on his selection chances. Bulldogs pursue ex-Knights coach Adam O\u2019Brien to shake up attack Michael Chammas The Canterbury Bulldogs are in talks with former Newcastle coach Adam O\u2019Brien about a role with the club next season.\n\nBulldogs officials met with O\u2019Brien on Thursday to discuss the prospect of him becoming the club\u2019s attack coach in 2026. Jason Taylor, who currently coaches the Dogs\u2019 attack, still has another year to run on his contract and is expected to move to a new role if O\u2019Brien signs. Manly have also shown interest in signing O\u2019Brien as an assistant coach, but sources with knowledge of the situation talking on the condition of anonymity said O\u2019Brien was leaning towards the Bulldogs. O\u2019Brien spent a decade working as an assistant to Craig Bellamy at Melbourne and a season under Trent Robinson at the Roosters before being head-hunted for the Knights\u2019 top job as Nathan Brown\u2019s successor.\n\nThe Bulldogs believe O\u2019Brien\u2019s experience and knowledge can boost an attack that came under fire for large parts of 2025. Adam O\u2019Brien pulled the pin after six years in charge of the Knights. Credit: Getty Images O\u2019Brien has worked with Bulldogs Kurt Mann, Sitili Tupouniua and Enari Tuala, as well as new recruit Leo Thompson. Bellamy says Jahrome Hughes will play in preliminary final Roy Ward\n\nHe won\u2019t have a Mal Meninga-size guard on his forearm but Melbourne Storm star Jahrome Hughes is set to play in the club\u2019s preliminary final at AAMI Park on Friday night. Hughes fractured his forearm in the last round of the season and seemed long odds to be able to return in time for the finals. Mal Meninga, right, sports his armguard after winning the 1989 ARL grand final with Canberra. Credit: Getty Images But the reigning Dally M Medallist has recovered quicker than expected and Storm coach Craig Bellamy is confident Hughes will play on Friday night against Cronulla, unless any last-minute issues arise. Returning Hughes to the side will mean rising halfback Jonah Pezet will likely drop out after starring in their qualifying final win over Canterbury-Bankstown two weeks ago.\n\nUnless something flares up for Hughes, Bellamy said he would be running out against the Cronulla Sharks despite having not completed \u201ca whole heap\u201d of contact work. \u201cHe\u2019s done enough to be confident in what he needs to do and what he is doing,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cSomething drastic would have to go wrong for him to miss.\u201d Bellamy laughed when asked if Hughes would need a large guard Meninga wore for the Canberra Raiders in the 1990s when Bellamy was also on the team. Meninga\u2019s oversized guard became the stuff of legend but wouldn\u2019t be allowed anywhere near a footy field today.\n\n\u201cI was at Canberra when Mal used to wear that guard and no one was game to near him at training in case you copped it,\u201d Bellamy said with a laugh. \u201cBut Hughesy\u2019s [guard] is a fair bit thinner than Mal\u2019s was.\u201d Storm star Jahrome Hughes trains with his new forearm guard on Thursday. Credit: Getty Images Bellamy also praised the toughness of second-rower Shawn Blore who will also return from a fractured larynx to play on Friday night. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty bad injury he got and he kept going in the game - he\u2019s a pretty tough unit,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cHe was busting to get back. He kept ringing me and telling me that \u201cI\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u201d but, obviously, I\u2019m taking more advice from the medical people than him. We are confident he has recovered.\u201d\n\nThe Storm thumped the Sharks 30-6 when they last met at AAMI Park in June but the Sharks have won nine games out of 10 since including knockout final wins over Sydney Roosters and minor premiers Canberra Raiders. So the Sharks will come in fired up as will a sellout crowd hoping to see the Storm progress to another grand final. \u201cI don\u2019t know who wrote them off. They finished fifth,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cTo beat the Roosters and then beat Canberra in Canberra - we know they are in good form, but we are just concerned with what we need to do and how we need to do it.\u201d The Storm hammered the Sharks but it kick-started Cronulla\u2019s season\n\nRoy Ward The last time Cronulla trudged off AAMI Park they were at their lowest point of the season. Since that 30-6 round 17 loss to the Storm, the Sharks have won nine of 10 games, including two knockout finals, and are now just one win away from the NRL grand final. The only problem is that the team standing between them and the NRL decider is the Storm, who they take on at AAMI Park in a preliminary final on Friday night.\n\nSharks playmaker Braydon Trindall remembers that night in June well, and how it galvanised his team to turn their season around. \u201cI think we were all just sick of letting the year slip away from us,\u201d Trindall recalled on Wednesday. \u201cSo we sat down and had a good talk about it and went out on the field and changed some of the actions that were hurting us. \u201cI think it was more of a club thing and everyone wanted to put in a bit more, and now look where we are.\u201d The Storm hammered the Sharks last time they met in Melbourne. Credit: Getty Images Trindall has carried an eye issue through recent games after taking a knock against the Sydney Roosters earlier in the finals, but while there is some visible blood, he said it had no impact on his vision.\n\n\u201cI copped a boot against the Roosters, but it\u2019s starting to heal now,\u201d he said. The Storm have plenty of respect for Trindall\u2019s kicking game and the threat it poses, but he knows accuracy is the key given the height and catching ability of Storm wingers Xavier Coates and Will Warbrick. \u201cIt\u2019s good when you have some good chases on the end of the kick,\u201d he said. \u201cWill is a good leaper, so there will be a bit of a challenge there. It doesn\u2019t really change things. I might shorten the kicks up a bit so they have to run a bit more, but we\u2019ve got some good catches as well so I won\u2019t change much.\u201d Knights approach premiership-winning half to work as attack consultant Michael Chammas\n\nThe Newcastle Knights have reached out to three-time premiership-winning playmaker Luke Keary about a role with the club as an attack and halves consultant from next season. The Knights are in the process of restructuring their coaching staff and have made the bold move to approach the recently retired Catalans pivot to gauge his interest in joining the club. Former Roosters playmaker Luke Keary could be heading to Newcastle. Credit: NRL Photos Keary worked with both new coach Justin Holbrook and director of football Chris James at the Sydney Roosters and is highly regarded as one of the smartest players in rugby league. Keary, who spent this season with Catalans in the Super League after finishing his NRL career at the Sydney Roosters in 2024, is weighing up the opportunity.\n\nThe 33-year-old wants to spend the summer travelling with his young family but is said to be keen to discuss the opportunity to link with the Knights. Newcastle are keen to add some specialised coaches to their ranks and believe Keary would be a huge asset to help work with recruits Dylan Brown and Sandon Smith, as well as incumbents Fletcher Sharpe and Kalyn Ponga. Newcastle\u2019s attack struggled to fire in 2025 under the guidance of attack coach Blake Green, who missed out on the job as Adam O\u2019Brien\u2019s successor to Holbrook. Keary doesn\u2019t have a job lined up at the Sydney Roosters, who themselves will welcome back Jared Waerea-Hargreaves in an official capacity to work with the club\u2019s younger players in 2026. Panthers duo shrug off injury worries ahead of Broncos showdown\n\nDan Walsh and Billie Eder Penrith\u2019s Liam Martin and Casey McLean insist they will be fit to play in Sunday\u2019s grand final qualifier against Brisbane after being forced from the field in the Panthers semi-final thumping of Canterbury. Martin was in obvious discomfort after he was tackled by former teammate Viliame Kikau, with the NSW and Kangaroos star staying down and struggling to breathe late in the contest.

TikTok contributes a small percentage of the company's total revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedia mogul Rupert Murdoch is reportedly part of the deal and would be joined by \"probably four or five absolutely world-class investors\", Trump said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Murdoch family joins TikTok US ownership deal, says Trump\n\nProtecting US assets\n\nTrump's efforts to sell the TikTok assets aim to address national security requirements outlined in a 2024 law and would allow for greater control over how TikTok's algorithm functions in the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move comes months after a ban on the China-based app was set to take effect at the outset of this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussing how the deal was made, Trump said: \"I spoke with President Xi. We had a good talk, I told him what we were doing, and he said 'go ahead with it.'\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUS vice president JD Vance told reporters in the Oval Office that the deal would protect citizens from \"propaganda\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This deal really does mean Americans can use TikTok but actually use it with more confidence than they had in the past because their data is secure and it won't be used as a propaganda weapon like it has in the past,\" Vance said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, he acknowledged the move was met with \"some resistance on the Chinese side\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fundamental thing that we wanted to accomplish is that we wanted to keep TikTok operating, but we also wanted to make sure that we protected Americans' data privacy as required by law,\" he said.\n\n\n\nA group of Republicans said they want to see more details of the deal to ensure it represents a clean break with China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As the details are finalised, we must ensure this deal protects American users from the influence and surveillance of CCP-aligned groups,\" the group said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has credited TikTok, which has 170 million US users, with helping him win reelection last year, and he has 15 million followers on his personal account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is going to be American-operated all the way,\" Trump said.\n\n\n\nWho will own the assets?\n\nMurdoch and \"probably four or five absolutely world-class investors\" would be part of the deal, Trump confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is going to be American-operated all the way,\" he said, suggesting that US companies and investors would have majority control over the new entity.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump said tech giant Oracle would be among the US investors in TikTok, but he did not disclose the full roster of new owners.\n\n\n\n\n\nA group of existing shareholders in ByteDance will hold a roughly 30 per cent stake, according to Reuters. Among ByteDance's current investors are venture capital firms Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic, and KKR.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by Reuters.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Key Points The H-1B visa program is a cornerstone of the United States' workforce, granting entry to 85,000 workers each year.\n\nOver the past five years, key players in Australia's tech industry have called on the government for a sector boost.\n\nExperts said the decision from the US presented an \"enormous\" opportunity for Australia to access high-level talent.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump's recent order to raise the country's fee for skilled migrant visa applications to US$100,000 ($151,000) has shaken the tech industry, visa holders and hopeful applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fee increase is set to greatly reduce the number of future skilled-worker applications made by US-based companies, especially for tech giants like Amazon, Meta and Google, which send the bulk of H-1B visa requests.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe H-1B visa program is a cornerstone of the US' skilled workforce, with 85,000 permits granted every year, largely in tech.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its 21 September decision, the White House said the visa, which was intended to bring skilled temporary workers into the US, had been \"deliberately exploited\" to replace American workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt later said the fee would be a one-off for new visa applicants and would not apply to applications submitted before 21 September.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, looming skills shortages and a flagging tech sector have led to growing calls for an overhaul of the country's migration program.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Trump clamps down on foreign talent, closing the door on nearly 100,000 workers a year, could Australia open its own?\n\n\n\nAn 'opportunity' for the tech sector\n\nOver the past five years, key players in Australia's tech industry have called on the government for a sector boost.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn August 2022, the federal government announced it would commit to a target of 1.2 million tech-related jobs by 2030.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal, informed by consultation with tech industry groups including the Tech Council of Australia, would require more than 500,000 workers to join the hiring pool.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, the government said its first step to achieving this was to \"accelerate\" processing times by clearing its backlog of millions of visa applications lodged during the COVID-19 pandemic period, prioritising \"skilled workers\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn December 2024, the federal government added a specialised visa stream for in-demand skills to replace the former temporary skills visa . The \"modernised\" skilled occupation list contained more than 450 roles, especially in construction, cyber security, agriculture and health.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer deputy secretary of the immigration department, Abul Rizvi, told SBS News the decision from the US presented an \"enormous\" opportunity for Australia to access high-level talent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It really does boil down to the preparedness of Australian industry and Australian employers to recruit these people. If they actively go out and recruit these people, then the visa categories are there to bring the people into Australia very quickly to enable them to get to work in Australia quickly. And find a pathway to permanent residents and citizenship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The key will be whether Australian employers wish to sponsor these people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian government announced in early September it would not make changes to the immigration cap , with its 2025-2026 intake to remain at the same levels and settings as the 2024-2025 program.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, the largest cohort of migrant arrivals consisted of temporary students, comprising 207,000 of a total 446,000 in the twelve months to June 2024.\n\n\n\nSome of Australia's biggest tech companies agree that Trump's announcement presents an opportunity for Australia, but they stress that policy and visa changes need to be made to entice skilled visa applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief financial officer of Australian business management software company Deputy, Emma Seymour, said Australia would become a \"top-tier choice\" for skilled migrant workers if changes were made.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese included \"rapid visa approvals, recognition of qualifications, partner work rights, and a transparent route to permanent residency\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia is in a unique time zone, bridging the US and Asia, with world-class universities and a trusted regulatory environment,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we pair that with targeted skilled migration, we can scale globally competitive product companies from here, especially in areas like HR and workplace tech and AI applications for real-world industries.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeymour said Deputy had seen \"firsthand\" how the right engineering, data, and product talent all contribute to productivity and revenue growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Technology is now Australia\u2019s third-largest industry, and with AI transforming every sector of the economy, the opportunity is bigger than ever \u2026 we just need to move fast enough to capture the full opportunity in front of us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n'I don't think we're going to become the new Silicon Valley'\n\nBut senior lecturer in migration policy at the University of Sydney, Anna Boucher, questioned whether H-1B candidates, who could \"go anywhere in the world\", would choose Australia as their destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don't have as large an intake into our skilled immigration program. And I guess more importantly, we're not really seen as a global tech centre yet,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said it was also about having adequate infrastructure to support opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whether we have that pipeline in place to suddenly accept all these super-talented former H-1B visa holders, I'm not sure. I don't think it's just an immigration issue though. Arguably, there would be capacity, but we just don't have a tech-focused visa in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBoucher said findings from a 2019 study on migrant interests and motivations found Australia had some draw-cards for potential skilled workers outside of its visa system, including that it was less expensive and had good weather in comparison to the US.\n\n\n\n\"I mean, they sound ridiculous, but these are the kinds of things, based on my study, that migrants are interested in,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have great weather, we have pretty good schools.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said since 2019, things had shifted, meaning Australia's democracy itself may have become an enticing factor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Maybe that security is what's become important, as there are fewer democracies in the world,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are things that motivate migrants, but the US has always been such a centre of migration that I would not be surprised if big tech just take the hit, because for them the benefits of this skilled labour far outweigh the price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No doubt this price point has been picked for a reason, it's what the Trump administration believes they can get away with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think we're going to become the new Silicon Valley.\"\n\n\n\nIssues for migrants\n\nYaser Naseri mentors migrant and refugee workers struggling to find work that matches their skill set in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told SBS News that when he arrived in the country, his qualification in industrial electricity was invalid, and even after re-skilling at university, he found it difficult to find work that matched his skill set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I sent around 90 applications and I got a handful of interviews only, so that was really surprising. I thought it would be much easier,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe mentioned that Australian employers tend to place a lot of importance on local experience, which made it difficult for people coming to the country for career opportunities to find adequate work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's like starting from scratch,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"Although you have experience and qualifications, you have to learn how to navigate the system, how to build your network, how you approach hiring managers and how you present and sell yourself. There are big challenges \u2014 lack of knowledge, cultural differences, lack of language \u2014 all at play here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent analysis has revealed a gap between Australia's demand for skilled workers and their ability to integrate into appropriate roles once here.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a report commissioned by Settlement Services International (SSI), more than 500,000 migrant workers already in Australia are working below their skill level.\n\n\n\n\n\nSSI CEO Violet Roumeliotis said Australia\u2019s migration program was designed to attract international talent, particularly to address national skills shortages, but the research showed that more than 621,000 migrants were unable to work to their full potential.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report found every state and territory would benefit financially if migrant workers were able to access appropriate job outcomes, with the report's authors estimating Australia's economy could be losing $9 billion per year.\n\n\n\nBut Rizvi said he doubted whether those issues were likely to affect skilled workers sought out by Australian companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Potential H-1B workers are not the group who would be struggling to get their skills recognised in Australia,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The group that is struggling to get their skills recognised in Australia tend to be skilled migrants who have come either through the family stream or as secondary applicants in the skill stream or as humanitarian entrants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They face the biggest barriers in getting their skills recognised, and there the range of issues are multiple.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRizvi said the challenge really lies with the tech sector to make use of Australia's skilled migrant visa pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is certainly an opportunity and I think the question really should be put to the Australian industry, the big, the big tech players in Australia, are they going to target these people?\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "A newly-approved Alzheimer's drug could help tens of thousands of Australians with the condition, but most people won't have access to the \"incredibly important\" medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\nLacenamab, which has the brand name Leqembi, has been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for use by some patients with mild cognitive impairment.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is shown to reduce a plaque in the brain called amyloid, which contributes to Alzheimer's symptoms, but carries a minor risk of swelling or bleeding on the brain.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are about 425,000 people in Australia living with dementia, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), which the degenerative brain disease, Alzheimer's disease, being the most common form.\n\n\n\n\n\nDementia is also a leading causes of death in Australia , the AIHW recently found.\n\n\n\n'Shattered' by diagnosis\n\nRetired police officer Peter Duclos was diagnosed with the condition in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I felt things weren't quite right \u2026 I was forgetful and just wasn't feeling like me,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I used to love photography, but now I've lost those skills.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You think you're great one day and then the next day you think: 'oh God, how do I do this again?'\"\n\n\n\nAfter seeing his GP and getting several scans, he was given his diagnosis of younger-onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe felt \"shattered\" and reached out to peak advocacy group Dementia Australia for support.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter taking a course with the group, he started volunteering as a peer support person for other people living with Alzheimer's and dementia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the approval of lecanemeb could help many people with the illness, but it's too late for him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I might be a bit further along with it [Alzheimer's] that can be beneficial for me now,\" he said.\n\n\n\nPeter Duclos lives on Sydney's northern beaches with family. Source: Supplied / Peter Duclos. He also said the cost would be prohibitive for most people with Alzheimer's.\n\n\n\n\n\nLecanemab has an estimated cost of $40,000 for a treatment cycle of between 12 and 18 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional health costs will take the price per patient up to around $80,000 to $100,000, depending on individual needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drug's cost could be decreased if the government decides to subsidise it through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS); however, it has not placed donanemab (sold as Kisunla), a comparable Alzheimer's drug approved earlier this year, on the scheme.\n\n\n\n'Well-deserved' approval\n\nChristopher Rowe, the director of the Australian Dementia Network, said the approval of lecanemab as a treatment is \"well deserved\", after its parent company failed twice to get the green light from the TGA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's third time lucky and Australia is a little late to the party. It's already been approved in 51 countries. So I'm glad to see it finally happened here,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact that they approved donanemab, which has very similar effectiveness and side effects to lecanemab, could have impacted their decision.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement released this week, the TGA said the Japanese drug manufacturer Eisai Australia has \"satisfactorily addressed the outstanding concerns regarding the safety of the medicine\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been concerns that the drug can have fatal consequences in around 0.6 per cent of people, as shown in a long-running UK trial of lecanemeb .\n\n\n\nBoth lecanemab and donanemab target a brain plaque called amyloid, which builds up over 10 years, according to Rowe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You've got to be picked up, diagnosed, and treated early for the drugs to work. It's because this takes amyloid out of the brain, but it doesn't affect what's called tau tangles,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Tau tangles [abnormal accumulations of a protein called tau in brain cells] really do the damage. If you've already got tau tangles, then removing amyloid doesn't show any benefit.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said lecanemab can extend people's quality of life and autonomy by around six months, allowing people to keep doing everyday tasks like grocery shopping.\n\n\n\nEarly diagnosis and cost a barrier\n\nBut there are two main issues still to address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Issue number one, you've got to get people very early in the disease. So most people won't qualify for this treatment,\" Rowe said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Issue number two is the cost at the moment; it's only available in private, and the drug itself costs around $40,000. But you've got other costs on top of that, which probably build up to about 80,000 in total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Without PBS coverage, this is a real impediment for a majority of the population.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Michael Woodwood, the head of dementia research at Austin Health, and an honorary advisor to Dementia Australia, told SBS News the approval is \"incredibly important.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Two new dementia risk factors identified \u2014 and what could help prevent or delay its onset\n\nHe said the introduction of lecanemab could incentivise more people to seek a diagnosis for Alzheimer's sooner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of fear around getting a diagnosis, and at this stage, the vast majority of cases are not actually diagnosed. I think that the availability of these drugs will change that,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the drugs won't change health outcomes for people in isolation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to have a health system that's ready to adapt to the increased number of people wanting a diagnosis,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's also important that the people still access all the other support services, the services of Dementia Australia, that they're aware of brain health, which includes exercise, diet, social mental activity, reducing cigarette smoking, et cetera.\"\n\n\n\nA 'new era' for Alzheimer's treatment worldwide\n\nLecanemab and donanemab approvals are increasing success rates in Alzheimer's treatment, according to global research published in the medical journal The Lancet this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlzheimer's disease accounts for about 70 per cent of all dementia cases worldwide, and scientists say there's more that can be done in caring for patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Blood tests, biological drugs for Alzheimer's disease, and prevention interventions are propelling care into entirely new and exciting territory. However, the old needs of patients will not disappear,\" Professor Giovanni Frisoni from the University of Geneva said.\n\n\n\nHe said there needs to be a concerted effort to support current and future patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"More general practitioners and dementia specialists will need to master the less glamorous but steady advances made in the past few decades in the care and treatment of behavioural disorders, the use of sophisticated diagnostic imaging and laboratory tools, and psychosocial care.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Duclos is part of a clinical trial for another drug and receives monthly transfusions as part of the testing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe is hopeful that drug trials both in Australia and overseas will improve treatment options for Alzheimer's.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We really need to get the government on board and have money spent in the right places for the right reasons. \"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "For my family, the story of Cathy Freeman's Sydney Olympic gold medal started 15 years before that historic night at Homebush Bay on 25 September 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe year was 1985. I remember it well. It was my final year of school in Canberra, and Aussie rock icon Jimmy Barnes had just released For the Working Class Man, an album that I blared on high rotation. I was living with my parents in south Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack then, the national capital was the beating heart of elite sport, home to the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS). Promising athletes from across the country came to Canberra to build the foundations of international success. That year, the AIS invited a 12-year-old Cathy to be assessed for her athletic ability.\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than stay in the AIS dormitories, Cathy was placed with us at the suggestion of a mutual family friend. The idea was to provide her with a family environment \u2014 and importantly, an Aboriginal family environment \u2014 during her stay.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was very young, very skinny, shy, and freezing. Canberra's winters are tough for anyone, but especially for a young Murri girl from Mackay in north Queensland.\n\n\n\nEach morning, Cathy was picked up and driven across the city for training and testing, before being dropped off at home at night.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the days wore on, the cold, fatigue, and relentless training took their toll. Cathy would come home exhausted, eat, and fall straight into bed. Sometimes not even eat. She was homesick and often made calls back to her mum. For two weeks, it was rinse and repeat. Every morning, my mum would have to wake her with a soft call from the bedroom door, or sometimes a gentle shake.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Cathy's career blossomed \u2014 from school athletics to nationals, Commonwealth Games, World Championships, and ultimately the Olympics \u2014 my mum would often call me and proudly claim her part in Cathy's success.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I didn't wake her up, there'd be no gold medals,\" she would joke.\n\n\n\nMum followed Cathy's career sparkle with enormous pride.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the Sydney Olympics in 2000, I stood among tens of thousands of other Australians at Tumbalong Park in Darling Harbour, watching Cathy's 400m final on a giant projection screen.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe starter's gun fired. Silence turned to thunder as the crowd roared her down the back straight. Cathy rounded the bend in third place, then exploded into the lead, powering through the home straight to stop the clock at 49.11. She crossed the line, collapsed, and a nation exhaled in unprecedented joy \u2014 Cathy in relief.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the live site erupted, my phone rang. It was my mum, calling from 1,800km away in far north Queensland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She's won! She's won!\" mum cried down the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our Cathy \u2014 our baby \u2014 has won!\"\n\n\n\nJohn-Paul Janke and his mum, who followed Cathy Freeman's career with enormous pride. Source: Supplied After 2000, whenever I saw Cathy at events, I'd share this story with her.\n\n\n\n\n\nI told her how mum always joked that without her morning wake-ups, there'd be no Olympic gold.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2003, at her first book launch, I bought a copy for mum. Cathy and I laughed together as I asked her to sign it.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I walked away, I flipped open the cover to see what she had written: \"Joanna, thanks for waking me up. Love, Cathy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow in her early 80s, mum still calls her \"our Cathy\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd since that September night 25 years ago, so too does the nation.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Denmark's prime minister has apologised to women who were victims of a decades-long involuntary birth control campaign, which has left islanders with deep scars and strained relations with their former colonial power.\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands of women and girls as young as 12 were fitted with intrauterine devices (IUDs) without their knowledge or consent between 1966 and 1991, the year Greenland was given authority over its healthcare system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't believe we can achieve the more equal and proper relationship that many of us desire unless we dare opening even the darkest chapters,\" Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, dressed all in black, said at a ceremony in Greenland's capital Nuuk.\n\n\n\nBetween the late 1960s and 1992, Danish authorities aimed to reduce the Inuit birth rate by forcing around 4,500 women to wear an intrauterine device without their consent. Source: AP / Mads Claus Rasmussen The ceremony marks another step in Denmark's accelerated efforts to repair ties with Greenland, following United States President Donald Trump's recent vows to assert control over the vast, resource-rich Arctic island for security reasons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Therefore, the apology I offer today is not only about the past. It is also about our present and our future. About the mutual trust that must exist between us,\" Frederiksen told victims, some of whom wiped tears from their faces.\n\n\n\nPhysical and psychological scars\n\nAn investigation this month showed 4,070 women had been fitted with IUDs by the end of 1970 \u2014 roughly every second Greenlandic-born woman of childbearing age.\n\n\n\nA large number of women reported debilitating abdominal pain and many have not been able to have children even after their device was removed, often due to severe infections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Receiving an apology does not mean that we accept what has happened. We are here today because we do not accept what has happened,\" Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen, who also wore black.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But it is up to all of us to take the next steps,\" Nielsen said.\n\n\n\nNaja Lyberth, who leads a group of women that last year sought legal compensation from Denmark over the campaign, thanked Frederiksen for her apology, saying it created space for Greenlanders to work through their shared trauma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The state has now emphasised that we are equal souls within the Danish realm,\" said Lyberth, who herself got an IUD aged 14.\n\n\n\n",

I knew that everyone was talking about it. And I was like, this should have been like a year ago, but whatever.\u201d What came after that was even better: a goal, in the third minute of stoppage time, to help seal a 3-1 victory. Scrappy as it was, it won\u2019t find a home on Kerr\u2019s highlight reel - unlike the \u201cout of body experience\u201d of scoring that goal against England at the 2023 Women\u2019s World Cup - but it was momentous all the same, and not just because it was her 100th for the club. Sam Kerr enters the fray after \u2026 well, too long on the sidelines. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI was relieved, and just kind of like, laughing,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think like the response that the girls gave me was really nice and melted my heart \u2026 [and] I just wanted to thank the Chelsea fans, because throughout these last few months, they\u2019ve been so supportive of me. Some of them probably lost a little bit of faith in, like, me or forgot what I could do on the pitch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had so many people over the last year say, \u2018Oh, she\u2019ll never get back to what she was.\u2019 Loading \u201cIt felt nice to be able to remind people. I don\u2019t even need a whole game. I can score an important goal in 20 minutes, whether it\u2019s my first game back or not.\u201d The comeback trail for Kerr was about twice as long as it should be for an ACL injury; it was a \u201cpretty crap\u201d experience, she said, but one that was put into perspective by the arrival of her first child, Jagger, with partner Kristie. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like I was sitting off the park, and I was training and having a great old time. It was doctor\u2019s appointment after doctor appointment, flying here, flying there, trying to fix my knee,\u201d she said.\n\nLoading \u201cI felt like every time \u2026 say I had six good weeks, then I\u2019d have two really bad weeks. I had maybe like seven or eight setbacks. Especially when it got to the pointy end of [ast] season, it\u2019s tough to not be involved in those games. As a competitor, you just want to be out there, and you just want to show people what you\u2019re made of. And that was really hard for me. \u201cThe good part of it was you play football for so long, you kind of think it\u2019s your identity and it\u2019s who you are. But with the time off, I got to spend more time with Kristie. We got to go home, see my family. We had Jags. So there was things that happened that really kept me going. Now I have a different look on football, and I don\u2019t hang so much of my life on it, I guess.\u201d Kerr turned 32 earlier this month, and though that might suggest she\u2019s in the twilight of her career, she insists that she\u2019s not. The impending Women\u2019s Asian Cup in Australia gives her another marquee event on home soil to look forward to, but her outlook stretches well beyond that, and even the next World Cup in 2027. In a recent interview with Nine, she said she has \u201cway more in my locker than one more\u201d World Cup - but when the time comes that she does retire, a career as a coach could beckon.",

From Nonna with Love: Stories of Tradition and Triumph charts the tales of the Italian migrants who came to Western Australia between the early 1900s to the 1970s \u2013 and, more specifically, the matriarchs who became the backbones of those communities which helped shape the identity of Perth, Fremantle, and the broader state. Ahead of its time: Anne Ferrari, left, with an early coffee roasting machine.

Pizzale\u2019s daughter, Carla Caravella, was overcome with emotion when she first saw the display. \u201cMrs Ferrari and mum lived a different life, because they were working, they were in the businesses working, and they worked long, hard hours, and so they weren\u2019t in the community socializing quite as much,\u201d Caravella says. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to have friends,\u201d Pizzale laughs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI was too busy, and I raised four children in the Capri Restaurant.\u201d \u201cThis has brought so much emotion forward, because it is such an important part of our history \u2026 and it honours all these ladies who are part of this exhibition, because they\u2019ve always been in the background, quietly, just keeping everything going,\u201d Caravella says.

The motivation for From Nonna With Love came from conversations Fitzgerald had with her mother about life in Italy during World War II, and the decision to migrate to Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to my mother, Angela. But in that tribute, is a tribute to every Nonna and great biznona that is here, both in Italy, Australia and around the world,\u201d she says. \u201cIt also tells the story of extraordinary Italian women who migrated here to Australia \u2026 it tells their stories of perseverance, belief and the love that they had to build a family and a wonderful future here for them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement",

In a classic sliding doors moment, Jones revealed the day he attended Red Bend Catholic College to watch trials for the Southern Country team. The best 17 players from that day would head to Sydney to try their luck at making the NSW Combined Catholic Colleges team. Selectors spotted Jones and asked him to help with proceedings. He initially told them he was there as a fan. \u201cBut I was glad I was there in the end because the teachers were never going to pick \u2018Yeoy\u2019,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPenrith on-field leader Isaah Yeo. Credit: Getty Images \u201cEvery recruitment officer gets a hunch. I had a hunch with him. \u201cI don\u2019t know what would have happened had I not been there. Who knows, maybe Yeoy would have still been playing in Dubbo. \u201cHe was on the bench for his team. He was wearing the No.14. But he was tall, mobile, tough, and skilful. \u201cThe selectors asked me at the end of the day what I thought. They were like, \u2018What about this fella?\u2019, and I was like, \u2018Yep\u2019, then I asked, \u2018What happened to the No.14?\u2019. They said, \u2018We didn\u2019t pick him\u2019. I said, \u2018You better put him back in\u2019. He was the only bloke I liked all day.\u201d Yeo made the cut and went to Sydney, but missed out on the NSW CCC team. He remained on Jones\u2019 radar and was later signed by Penrith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones had similar \u201chunches\u201d with Panthers fullback Dylan Edwards, and even Liam Martin, two of Yeo\u2019s teammates who will feature in Sunday\u2019s preliminary final against the Broncos. There were also a couple of players Jones missed, like the day he was sent to the Confraternity Carnival, a popular schoolboys tournament in Queensland, in the early 1990s, with the simple instruction of landing one signature. He wanted two and begged Phil Gould, who was then working with the Panthers, only to be told to stick with one. Wendell Sailor is one who \u2018got away\u2019 from the Panthers. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI signed a fullback, Butch Fatnowna, who was brilliant,\u201d Jones said. \u201cBut he broke his ankle, and by the time he was ready to come down to Sydney, he had put on a bit of weight. \u201cGus was into me about it, but I said, \u2018you wouldn\u2019t let me sign two\u2019. That second player I wanted was Wendell Sailor.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSailor went on to win premierships with the Broncos and became a dual international. Isaah Yeo doing the hard work earlier this year. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI still have a picture on the wall in my office of Wendell with the message, \u2018thanks for not picking me, Jimmy\u2019,\u201d Jones said. Yeo\u2019s father, Justin, recalled his boy \u201cbeing OK, but never a standout, and certainly never the first kid picked\u201d. \u201cHe was a bit like he is now, always strong, with little difference between his best game and worst game,\u201d Yeo snr said. \u201cMost of the time, he looked like another player. I remember he was playing SG Ball, and Ivan Cleary walked into the box at the very moment Isaah made a break and did something special. The coaches told Ivan, \u2018that\u2019s Isaah Yeo\u2019. Isaah Yeo led the Kangaroos at last year\u2019s Pacific Championships. Credit: Getty Images\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou often wonder if things would have been different had Ivan not walked into the box at that very moment, or looked up to see what Isaah was doing at that exact time. \u201cI teach at a school in Mudgee, and I still tell the kids how you need to make the most of every moment and opportunity; if you get an opportunity, it\u2019s up to you what you do with it.\u201d The kid wearing the No.14 jersey that day in 2012 \u2013 and who made a break when Cleary took a peek \u2013 has become one of the most influential forwards in the game. The attributes he provides are a large part of the reason Penrith can defeat Brisbane and give themselves a shot at five straight premierships next Sunday. Yeo is admired on both sides of the border, with Cameron Smith \u2013 the Melbourne, Queensland, and Australian legend who finished with 430 NRL games \u2013 praising the 30-year-old\u2019s durability. \u201cWhen you look at his last five years, Isaah has barely missed a game of footy,\u201d Smith said.\n\nAdvertisement",

It was the highest-rating preliminary final performance since Champion Data started keeping records. Coach Chris Scott insisted afterwards that they don\u2019t wrap the champion veteran in cotton wool and unleash him in September, but there must be some truth in that with his management in his 18th season. Dangerfield enhanced his legacy with a masterful performance in the Cats\u2019 preliminary final win over Hawthorn. Credit: Getty Images The best-on-ground performance, which propelled Geelong into their seventh grand final since 2007, even triggered a discussion between his teammates about where \u201cPat\u201d stacks up among the AFL\u2019s modern giants. Max Holmes believes Dangerfield is \u201ceasily\u201d inside the top five, while Shaun Mannagh has him on the podium \u2013 and joked that the man himself would probably place himself there, too.\n\nLoading \u201cGary Ablett jnr is a clear No.1, I\u2019d say,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cI honestly want to put Patty second, but I know people scream that \u2018Dusty\u2019 [Dustin Martin] is better, and \u2018Buddy\u2019 [Lance Franklin] is up there as well. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to rank those players, but I think \u2018Danger\u2019 is in that top five, for sure. He\u2019s incredible to play alongside, and I guess that\u2019s a perk of being at Geelong. There are stars everywhere who you can take a lot of wisdom from.\u201d Bowes \u2013 who chose to join the Cats in large part because of Dangerfield\u2019s involvement \u2013 agrees with Mannagh, pointing to his 359 games, eight All-Australian selections and four club champion awards across two clubs, as well as him winning the 2016 Brownlow Medal and playing in the 2022 premiership. \u201cThe only thing missing on his resume is being captain in a grand final and winning the premiership, so hopefully, we can tick that off for him,\u201d Bowes said.\n\nEmerging midfielder Jhye Clark, the Cats\u2019 super sub in the preliminary final, has a different measure for Dangerfield. After entering the match when Tom Stewart was concussed before quarter-time, Clark had a front-row seat to Dangerfield\u2019s extraordinary feats. \u201cIt\u2019s so sick. He\u2019s one of a kind,\u201d Clark said. Jhye Clark (left) celebrates Geelong\u2019s preliminary final win with Dangerfield. Credit: Getty Images \u201cHe just runs straight through everyone, and when you watch him play \u2013 you just want to run through a brick wall. He\u2019s so inspiring for the whole team, and I\u2019d be very scared of playing against him.\u201d Don\u2019t mess with Danger\u2019s play list\n\nShannon Neale was yet to make his AFL debut when he walked into the player gym at Kardinia Park one day in the 2022 pre-season. Zach Tuohy, Rhys Stanley and Dangerfield were already in there. Country music was blasting from the speakers, which a then-19-year-old Neale was unimpressed with before he made a mistake he will never forget. Dangerfield has formed a close bond with Shannon Neale (second from right) after an inauspicious start. Credit: Getty Images Without a moment of hesitation, the big forward from Perth pressed the \u201cskip\u201d button. \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t change the music! You can\u2019t do that!\u2019,\u201d Dangerfield crossly told Neale, who initially laughed, thinking his reaction was a joke.\n\nLoading \u201cBut he said, \u2018I\u2019m dead serious\u2019 and he\u2019s got the finger pointing at me, and everything,\u201d Neale recalled. \u201cI walked out of the gym, and I almost left the club that afternoon. About 20 minutes later, he sends me a message, and he\u2019s like, \u2018Mate, I am extremely sorry, the [summer] heat got to me \u2013 it\u2019s fine\u2019. \u201cIt took me a couple of weeks to look him in the eyes again. He wasn\u2019t the captain at the time, but obviously, he\u2019s a leader. He\u2019s such a figure. It\u2019s Patrick Dangerfield. Anything that happens like that; you think you\u2019re done.\u201d Neale sheepishly shared the Dangerfield story, which he thinks might get him in trouble, but he wanted to make the point that it was a sliding doors moment for their relationship, which was limited at the time. They are only two lockers apart, now sit alongside one another in team meetings, and have formed a close bond.\n\n\u201cI can ask him for advice, and I feel very comfortable approaching him about anything,\u201d Neale said. \u201cHe\u2019s super witty, and loves a laugh. I think he\u2019s really enjoying his footy. He\u2019s relaxed, and enjoying where he\u2019s at, and certainly, our friendship has blossomed since that moment.\u201d Another speaker-related Dangerfield story emerged last Friday night. It was all love between Shaun Mannagh and Dangerfield last week. Credit: AFL Photos The evergreen skipper was controlling the tunes again pre-match against the Hawks, but made the left-field choice of classical music. This time it wasn\u2019t just Neale who took umbrage, prompting Dangerfield to relent and change to a different song, Kenny Loggins\u2019 Danger Zone.",

Manly have also shown interest in signing O\u2019Brien as an assistant coach, but sources with knowledge of the situation talking on the condition of anonymity said O\u2019Brien was leaning towards the Bulldogs. O\u2019Brien spent a decade working as an assistant to Craig Bellamy at Melbourne and a season under Trent Robinson at the Roosters before being head-hunted for the Knights\u2019 top job as Nathan Brown\u2019s successor.\n\nThe Bulldogs believe O\u2019Brien\u2019s experience and knowledge can boost an attack that came under fire for large parts of 2025.

Bellamy says Jahrome Hughes will play in preliminary final Roy Ward\n\nHe won\u2019t have a Mal Meninga-size guard on his forearm but Melbourne Storm star Jahrome Hughes is set to play in the club\u2019s preliminary final at AAMI Park on Friday night. Hughes fractured his forearm in the last round of the season and seemed long odds to be able to return in time for the finals.

Returning Hughes to the side will mean rising halfback Jonah Pezet will likely drop out after starring in their qualifying final win over Canterbury-Bankstown two weeks ago.\n\nUnless something flares up for Hughes, Bellamy said he would be running out against the Cronulla Sharks despite having not completed \u201ca whole heap\u201d of contact work. \u201cHe\u2019s done enough to be confident in what he needs to do and what he is doing,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cSomething drastic would have to go wrong for him to miss.\u201d Bellamy laughed when asked if Hughes would need a large guard Meninga wore for the Canberra Raiders in the 1990s when Bellamy was also on the team. Meninga\u2019s oversized guard became the stuff of legend but wouldn\u2019t be allowed anywhere near a footy field today.\n\n\u201cI was at Canberra when Mal used to wear that guard and no one was game to near him at training in case you copped it,\u201d Bellamy said with a laugh. \u201cBut Hughesy\u2019s [guard] is a fair bit thinner than Mal\u2019s was.\u201d Storm star Jahrome Hughes trains with his new forearm guard on Thursday. Credit: Getty Images Bellamy also praised the toughness of second-rower Shawn Blore who will also return from a fractured larynx to play on Friday night. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty bad injury he got and he kept going in the game - he\u2019s a pretty tough unit,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cHe was busting to get back. He kept ringing me and telling me that \u201cI\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u201d but, obviously, I\u2019m taking more advice from the medical people than him. We are confident he has recovered.\u201d\n\nThe Storm thumped the Sharks 30-6 when they last met at AAMI Park in June but the Sharks have won nine games out of 10 since including knockout final wins over Sydney Roosters and minor premiers Canberra Raiders. So the Sharks will come in fired up as will a sellout crowd hoping to see the Storm progress to another grand final. \u201cI don\u2019t know who wrote them off. They finished fifth,\u201d Bellamy said. \u201cTo beat the Roosters and then beat Canberra in Canberra - we know they are in good form, but we are just concerned with what we need to do and how we need to do it.\u201d The Storm hammered the Sharks but it kick-started Cronulla\u2019s season\n\nRoy Ward The last time Cronulla trudged off AAMI Park they were at their lowest point of the season. Since that 30-6 round 17 loss to the Storm, the Sharks have won nine of 10 games, including two knockout finals, and are now just one win away from the NRL grand final. The only problem is that the team standing between them and the NRL decider is the Storm, who they take on at AAMI Park in a preliminary final on Friday night.\n\nSharks playmaker Braydon Trindall remembers that night in June well, and how it galvanised his team to turn their season around. \u201cI think we were all just sick of letting the year slip away from us,\u201d Trindall recalled on Wednesday. \u201cSo we sat down and had a good talk about it and went out on the field and changed some of the actions that were hurting us. \u201cI think it was more of a club thing and everyone wanted to put in a bit more, and now look where we are.\u201d The Storm hammered the Sharks last time they met in Melbourne. Credit: Getty Images Trindall has carried an eye issue through recent games after taking a knock against the Sydney Roosters earlier in the finals, but while there is some visible blood, he said it had no impact on his vision.\n\n\u201cI copped a boot against the Roosters, but it\u2019s starting to heal now,\u201d he said. The Storm have plenty of respect for Trindall\u2019s kicking game and the threat it poses, but he knows accuracy is the key given the height and catching ability of Storm wingers Xavier Coates and Will Warbrick. \u201cIt\u2019s good when you have some good chases on the end of the kick,\u201d he said. \u201cWill is a good leaper, so there will be a bit of a challenge there. It doesn\u2019t really change things. I might shorten the kicks up a bit so they have to run a bit more, but we\u2019ve got some good catches as well so I won\u2019t change much.\u201d Knights approach premiership-winning half to work as attack consultant Michael Chammas\n\nThe Newcastle Knights have reached out to three-time premiership-winning playmaker Luke Keary about a role with the club as an attack and halves consultant from next season. The Knights are in the process of restructuring their coaching staff and have made the bold move to approach the recently retired Catalans pivot to gauge his interest in joining the club. Former Roosters playmaker Luke Keary could be heading to Newcastle. Credit: NRL Photos Keary worked with both new coach Justin Holbrook and director of football Chris James at the Sydney Roosters and is highly regarded as one of the smartest players in rugby league. Keary, who spent this season with Catalans in the Super League after finishing his NRL career at the Sydney Roosters in 2024, is weighing up the opportunity.\n\nThe 33-year-old wants to spend the summer travelling with his young family but is said to be keen to discuss the opportunity to link with the Knights. Newcastle are keen to add some specialised coaches to their ranks and believe Keary would be a huge asset to help work with recruits Dylan Brown and Sandon Smith, as well as incumbents Fletcher Sharpe and Kalyn Ponga. Newcastle\u2019s attack struggled to fire in 2025 under the guidance of attack coach Blake Green, who missed out on the job as Adam O\u2019Brien\u2019s successor to Holbrook. Keary doesn\u2019t have a job lined up at the Sydney Roosters, who themselves will welcome back Jared Waerea-Hargreaves in an official capacity to work with the club\u2019s younger players in 2026. Panthers duo shrug off injury worries ahead of Broncos showdown\n\nDan Walsh and Billie Eder Penrith\u2019s Liam Martin and Casey McLean insist they will be fit to play in Sunday\u2019s grand final qualifier against Brisbane after being forced from the field in the Panthers semi-final thumping of Canterbury. Martin was in obvious discomfort after he was tackled by former teammate Viliame Kikau, with the NSW and Kangaroos star staying down and struggling to breathe late in the contest. The 28-year-old came from the field and struggled to make his way up the Accor Stadium tunnel at one point, but he was in good spirits soon afterwards and said he was not concerned about any recurrence of a rib cartilage injury he carried through last year\u2019s finals. \u201cThey\u2019re all right now,\u201d Martin said of his ribs after full-time. \u201cThere was a bit of carry-on there. It\u2019s a bit sore at the moment, but they\u2019re all right. I landed on the ball, and \u2018Kiks\u2019 is a pretty big man, and he landed on me. I was a bit winded, but I\u2019m all right now.\n\nLiam Martin is helped from the field at Accor Stadium. Credit: Getty Images \u201cIt crossed my mind at first [that a serious injury may have occurred], but after a while I was like \u2018it\u2019s all right, I\u2019m being a sook again\u2019.\u201d Martin won last year\u2019s Clive Churchill medal against Melbourne despite playing through the pain of a popped rib cartilage in the 2024 grand final. Loading He also required painkilling injections for almost the entire season to manage an ongoing AC joint injury in his shoulder, which he has battled again in recent weeks.",

It does help without Tom Stewart there \u2013 it\u2019s unfortunate for Tom, but it does help as a Lions supporter, him not being there. \u201cBut Ty and Logan have done an amazing job as a couple of youngsters. We\u2019ve got quite a diverse forward line, all of our guys can kick multiple goals.\u201d Kai Lohmann has rediscovered his mojo at the right time. Credit: Getty Images Lohmann has success on the biggest stage, after his four goals in last year\u2019s decider. While the 22-year-old\u2019s body kept him from hitting his straps for much of 2025, he has rediscovered his mojo \u2013 kicking goals in his past eight games, including three in the semi-final against the Suns.\n\nAnd Lohmann declared his fitness would be no concern on Saturday. \u201cLast year was pretty perfect, the way my body was and how I was leading into the game full of energy. This year\u2019s been a bit difficult with my body, but \u2026 I\u2019m feeling a lot better,\u201d Lohmann said. \u201cThe last few weeks have been really good, I\u2019m still dealing with a bit, but it\u2019s been a lot better. It [the ankle] just seems to be lingering a little bit this year. \u201cI\u2019ve figured out how to play through injuries and get through these tough times.\u201d\n\nLoading The energy Morris and Lohmann brought to Brisbane\u2019s premiership cause was largely credited as rejuvenating their 2024 season. While Morris was kept to just six touches when Brisbane last faced the Cats, Lohmann believed there would be no repeat. \u201cI saw glimpses last year he was going to be a pretty special player,\u201d Lohmann said. \u201cHe can take his game to another level. We\u2019ve got a really good young group, which is going to be exciting for Lions fans for a lot of years.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Gallop will play just his sixth AFL game in the decider, meaning four of those clashes have all been finals fixtures. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a good experience just to see what I\u2019m capable of, it is being thrown in the deep end, but I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way,\u201d Gallop said. The Sunshine Coast product has had a remarkable ascent, after being spotted playing for the Maroochydore Colts before being invited into the Lions\u2019 academy. Against the Magpies, his third goal proved to himself he belonged among the elite. His second, working through traffic, got Brisbane back in front after Collingwood\u2019s rampant second quarter.\n\nTy Gallop celebrates a goal. Credit: AFL Photos \u201cThe first two was just being in the right place at the right time, but it was good to take a good mark on the last one and put that through,\u201d Gallop said. \u201cI was playing my senior footy and wasn\u2019t too sure what was happening. Last year I was part of the Allies program and got a couple of games, and then I spoke to some role models of mine who gave me the confidence to back myself in and see where it could take me.\u201d Loading Success for the Lions could hinge on Cameron bursting out of his perceived slump to inspire a Geelong boilover.",
