        "text": "The world's richest man could lose billions in his fight with world's most powerful politician.\n\nThe feud between Elon Musk and Donald Trump could mean Tesla's plans for self-driving cars hit a roadblock, SpaceX flies fewer missions for NASA, Starlink gets fewer overseas satellite contracts and the social media platform X loses advertisers.\n\nMaybe, that is. It all depends on Trump's appetite for revenge and how the dispute unfolds.\n\nREAD MORE: Musk lobs unfounded Epstein accusation at Trump\n\nElon Musk and Donald Trump have had a nasty falling out. (AP)\n\nJoked Telemetry Insight auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid, \"Since Trump has no history of retaliating against perceived adversaries, he'll probably just let this pass.\"\n\nTurning serious, he sees trouble ahead for Musk.\n\n\"For someone that rants so much about government pork, all of Elon's businesses are extremely dependent on government largesse, which makes him vulnerable.\"\n\nTrump and the US federal government also stand to lose from a long-running dispute, but not as much as Musk.\n\nTesla robotaxis\n\nThe dispute comes just a week before a planned test of Tesla's driverless taxis in Austin, Texas, a major event for the company because sales of its EVs are lagging in many markets, and Musk needs a win.\n\nTrump can mess things up for Tesla by encouraging federal safety regulators to step in at any sign of trouble for the robotaxis.\n\nEven before the war of words broke out on Thursday, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration requested data on how Musk's driverless, autonomous taxis will perform in low-visibility conditions. That request follows an investigation last year into 2.4 million Teslas equipped with full self-driving software after several accidents, including one that killed a pedestrian.\n\nA spokesman for NHTSA said the probe was ongoing and that the agency \"will take any necessary actions to protect road safety.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice has also probed the safety of Tesla cars, but the status of that investigation is unclear. The DOJ did not respond immediately to requests for comment.\n\nThe promise of a self-driving future led by Tesla inspired shareholders to boost the stock by 50 per cent in the weeks after Musk confirmed the Austin rollout. But on Thursday, the stock plunged more than 14 per cent amid the Trump-Musk standoff. On Friday, it recovered a bit, bouncing back nearly 4 per cent.\n\n\"Tesla's recent rise was almost entirely driven by robotaxi enthusiasm,\" said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \"Elon's feud with Trump could be a negative.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Tesla suffers wipeout as investors walk away\n\nDonald Trump has been trading barbs with Elon Musk. (AP)\n\nCarbon credits business\n\nOne often-overlooked but important part of Tesla's business that could take a hit is its sales of carbon credits.\n\nAs Musk and Trump were slugging it out Thursday, Republican politicians inserted new language into Trump's budget bill that would eliminate fines for gas-powered cars that fall short of fuel economy standards. Tesla has a thriving side business selling \"regulatory credits\" to other automakers to make up for their shortfalls.\n\nMusk has downplayed the importance of the credits business, but the changes would hurt Tesla as it reels from boycotts of its cars tied to Musk's time working for Trump.\n\nCredit sales jumped by a third to A$892.5 million in the first three months of the year even as total revenue slumped.\n\nReviving sales\n\nMusk's foray into right-wing politics cost Tesla sales among the environmentally minded consumers who embraced electric cars and led to boycotts of Tesla showrooms.\n\nIf Musk has indeed ended his close association with Trump, those buyers could come back, but that's far from certain.\n\nMeanwhile, one analyst speculated earlier this year that Trump voters in so-called red counties could buy Teslas \"in a meaningful way.\" But he's now less hopeful.\n\n\"There are more questions than answers following Thursday developments,\" TD Cowen's Itay Michaeli wrote in his latest report, \"and it's still too early to determine any lasting impacts.\"\n\nMichaeli's stock target for Tesla earlier this year was A$582. He has since lowered it to A$495. Tesla was trading Friday at A$450.\n\nTesla did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTesla Cybertrucks are displayed at the AutoMobility LA Auto Show. (AP)\n\nMoonshot mess\n\nTrump said Thursday that he could cut government contracts to Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, a massive threat to a company that has received billions of federal dollars.\n\nThe privately held company that is reportedly worth A$525 billion provides launches, sends astronauts into space for NASA and has a contract to send a team from the space agency to the moon next year.\n\nBut if Musk has a lot to lose, so does the US.\n\nSpaceX is the only US company capable of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules. The other alternative is politically dicey: depending wholly on Russia's Soyuz capsules.\n\nMusk knew all this when he shot back at Trump that SpaceX would begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft. But it is unclear how serious his threat was. Several hours later \u2014 in a reply to another X user \u2014 he said he wouldn't do it.\n\nStarlink impact\n\nA subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk's once-close relationship with the president.\n\nMusk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for some services during a trip with Trump in the Middle East last month. The company has also won a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere as Trump has threatened tariffs.\n\nElon Musk accused Donald Trump of being in the Epstein files. (AP)\n\nIt's not clear how much politics played a role, and how much is pure business.\n\nOn Friday, The Associated Press confirmed that India had approved a key license to Starlink. At least 40 per cent of India's more than 1.4 billion people have no access to the internet.\n\nAd revival interrupted\n\nBig advertisers that fled X after Musk welcomed all manner of conspiracy theories to the social media platform have started to trickle back in recent months, possibly out of fear of a conservative backlash.\n\nMusk has called their decision to leave an \"illegal boycott\" and sued them, and the Trump administration recently weighed in with a Federal Trade Commission probe into possible coordination among them.\n\nNow advertisers may have to worry about a different danger.\n\nIf Trump sours on X, \"there's a risk that it could again become politically radioactive for major brands,\" said Sarah Kreps, a political scientist at Cornell University. She added, though, that an \"exodus isn't obvious, and it would depend heavily on how the conflict escalates, how long it lasts and how it ends.\"",

        "text": "In today's age of smartwatches and Fitbits, it's hard to go for more than a few hours without taking a sneaky peak at your daily step count.\n\nWhether it's the endorphin rush from the celebratory ping to inform you that you've hit 10,000 steps, or the nagging sense of shame that comes with the realisation you've done less than 2,000 \u2013 as happens on some of my busier days glued to my desk \u2013 step counts have become part of our lives.\n\nBut they're not just a gimmick.\n\nResearch is increasingly showing that your daily step count, especially when averaged out across months and years, makes a huge difference to your disease risk and how long you can expect to live. (Getty)\n\nResearch is increasingly showing that your daily step count, especially when averaged out across months and years, makes a huge difference to your disease risk and how long you can expect to live.\n\nAnd the case for not moving more makes for sober reading: according to the Government's official statistics, physical inactivity is responsible for one in six otherwise preventable deaths.\n\nMonitoring step counts makes it easier to track whether we're being active or not.\n\nBut while 10,000 is often seen as the magic number, it originates from a Japanese marketing campaign ahead of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, rather than hard science.\n\nSo how can increasing your step count make a difference to your health and how do different thresholds reduce your disease risk?\n\nAnd, perhaps more importantly, what really is the optimal number you should be aiming to hit a day?\n\nWalk 2000-3000 to reduce your risk of heart disease\n\nTwo years ago, an international scientific collaboration published one of the largest studies so far to examine the long-term relationship between step count and health.\n\nCombining data from more than 111,000 individuals from various electronic health records, it indicated that the lower limit for health benefits lies in the range of 2,000 to 3,000 steps per day.\n\nThis equates to just over a mile of total walking from the moment you wake up to when you go to sleep.\n\nThe benefits appear most acute when it comes to heart health.\n\nPublished in the Journal of The American College of Cardiology , it suggested that between 2,517 and 2,735 steps per day already reduces risk of cardiovascular disease by 11 per cent compared to those who did just 2,000 steps.\n\nWhile 10,000 is often seen as the magic number, it originates from a Japanese marketing campaign ahead of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, rather than hard science. (Getty)\n\nSimilar findings emerged from another study published last year by researchers at the University of Sydney.\n\nBased on data from more than 72,000 British people in their early 60s, it showed that anything beyond 2,200 steps per day will already make some difference to your heart health and even your short-term risk of dying from another cause.\n\nREAD MORE: Huge eruption in Italy leaves tourists fleeing volcano\n\n\"We ideally would want 8,000 to 10,000 steps a day, but for people who are inactive, that amount may seem like a mountain and unachievable,\" says Matthew Ahmadi, a researcher at the University of Sydney.\n\n\"It's about setting initial targets that are achievable, and then gradually working your way up to more daily steps as you build up your capacity to handle more activity.\"\n\nWalk 4000 steps to reduce your risk of dementia\n\nHitting 4,000 steps a day, based on the Sydney research, can reduce your risk of a premature death from any chronic disease by 20 per cent, particularly if you're middle aged.\n\nBut one of the most crucial things about reaching the 4,000-5,000 daily step count is that it starts to reduce your risk of cognitive decline.\n\nMan armed with plastic bags defies world's biggest army View Gallery\n\nThree years ago, a study of more than 78,000 Britons aged 40 to 79, who were regular smartwatch or Fitbit wearers, showed that 3,800 steps appears to be the minimum daily dose of exercise required to preserve your mental faculties.\n\nPeople who averaged this number of steps each day were found to have a 25 per cent lower risk of dementia compared with those who did less.\n\n\"This step count equates to roughly 35-45 minutes of light to moderate intensity walking per day, depending on your pace, which aligns well with [public health] guidelines,\" says Dr Borja del Pozo Cruz, a scientist at the European University of Madrid, who carried out the study.\n\n\"This is likely because of improved blood flow to the brain, reduced brain inflammation, better metabolism of glucose in the brain, and an increase in beneficial brain chemicals which stimulate neuron growth.\"\n\nWalk 7000 steps to lower your risk of depression\n\nThis seems to be the threshold at which the benefits become even more significant.\n\n7,000 steps are equivalent to just over three miles of walking, and it seems to be highly relevant for mental wellbeing.\n\nA new study published in December \u2013 which collated research from 33 different studies, comprising around 100,000 people \u2013 found that those who take 7,000 steps per day have a 31 per cent lower risk of depression.\n\n\"7,000 steps is starting to be considered a more active lifestyle, while less than 5,000 steps is a sedentary lifestyle,\" says Dr Bruno Bizzozero Peroni, a researcher at the University of Castilla-La Mancha who authored the study.\n\n\"It definitely seems that somewhere between 7,000 and 10,000 steps has a protective effect against depression, while at the moment there doesn't appear to be any evidence of additional benefits for mental health of doing more than 10,000 steps.\"\n\nAn average of 7,126 steps per day has also been shown to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease by 51 per cent, compared with people who did just 2,000 steps.\n\nSo do you really need to reach 10,000 steps per day?\n\nThis target which equates to around five miles of walking, or an hour and 40 minutes, if you were going to do the full amount of steps in one go can seem somewhat daunting. But as so often is the case in health and medicine, the answer is somewhat complex.\n\nAround 9,800 steps per day has been found in some studies to be the 'optimal dose' of exercise to lower risk of dementia.\n\nBut as with depression, it appears that you can still substantially reduce your risk of various chronic diseases, with a little less.\n\nFor example, some have found that approximately 8,800 steps per day reduces risk of premature death from a whole range of diseases by 60 per cent.\n\n\"More steps means better blood vessel function, less inflammation, and enhanced brain plasticity \u2013 the formation of new connections in the brain \u2013 which are crucial for cognition,\" says Dr Del Pozo Cruz.\n\nAll this means is that 10,000 steps is not necessarily the magic number after all. It appears that 9,000 is more than sufficient.\n\n7,000 steps are equivalent to just over three miles of walking, and it seems to be highly relevant for mental wellbeing. (Getty)\n\nHow many steps should I do a day to lose weight?\n\nLosing weight requires you to be in calorie deficit, so Dr Ahmadi points out that steps alone aren't sufficient, you also need to cut down on the amount you're consuming.\n\n\"However, what we do know is that activity can improve our cardiometabolic health even if you don't lose weight,\" he says.\n\nWhile research has shown that reaching 10,000 steps per day will increase your chances of losing weight, the more important aspect with weight loss is the intensity of exercise, not the number of steps.\n\nResearchers advise more vigorous intensity exercise but it doesn't have to be jogging or playing sport.\n\n\"You can get to vigorous intensity, just with brisk walking,\" says Catrine Tudor-Locke, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. \"It doesn't have to be running.\"\n\nHow many calories will you burn while walking?\n\nWeight 2,000 steps 5,000 steps 7,000 steps 10,000 steps 54kg 50-60 calories 125-150 calories 175-210 calories 250-300 calories 70kg 70-80 calories 175-200 calories 245-280 calories 350-400 calories 84kg 80-90 calories 200-225 calories 280-315 calories 400-450 calories\n\nDoes walking burn a lot of calories?\n\nThis largely depends on your weight, as the more body fat you're carrying, the more calories you're likely to burn, as the body uses up more energy when it comes to moving additional weight stored in the form of fat tissue.\n\nHowever, the below represents a rough guide.",

(ispace, inc. via AP) (AP)\n\nTwo years ago the company's first moonshot ended in a crash landing, giving rise to the name Resilience for its successor lander. Resilience carried a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist's toy-size red house for placement on the moon's dusty surface.\n\nLong the province of governments, the moon became a target of private outfits in 2019, with more flops than wins along the way.\n\nLaunched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. It shared a SpaceX ride with Firefly Aerospace's Blue Ghost, which reached the moon faster and became the first private entity to successfully land there in March.\n\nResilience was targeting the top of the moon, a less forbidding place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side's northern tier.\n\nPlans had called for Resilience to beam back pictures within hours and for the lander to lower the piggybacking rover onto the lunar surface this weekend.\n\nREAD MORE: Tesla suffers wipeout as investors walk away\n\nThe founder and chief executive of ispace, Takeshi Hakamada, speaking at mission control on Friday, June 6, 2025.

        "text": "The world's richest person has lost $US34 billion ($52 billion) from his personal net worth at the end of the day, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nElon Musk's staggering loss is the second-largest ever in the index's history, according to Bloomberg. It comes in second because the Tesla CEO suffered a bigger dive in November 2021.\n\nBut the loss is a drop in the bucket for the Tesla and SpaceX chief. As of June 5, he was still the richest person in the world, with a net worth of around $US334 billion.\n\nNot long ago, Elon Musk was jumping for joy while standing at Donald Trump's side. Now, he's losing billions of dollars at a rapid pace. (AP)\n\nTesla shares suffer 14 per cent plunge\ufeff\n\nIt comes after shares of Musk's electric vehicle company plunged more than 14 per cent, knocking about $US150 billion ($230 billion) off Tesla's market valuation as investors fear his dispute with US President Donald Trump will hurt the company.\n\nTesla closed down more than 14 per cent as a disagreement over the US president's budget bill turned nasty.\n\nAfter Musk said that Trump wouldn't haven't gotten elected without his help, Trump implied that he may turn the federal government against his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.\n\nPresident Donald Trump inspects a Tesla with Elon Musk on the front lawn of the White House earlier this year. (AP)\n\n\"The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,\" Trump wrote on his social messaging service Truth Social. \"I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!\"\n\nThe shares tanked earlier this year as Musk's association with DOGE damaged the car company's brand. Shares rallied when he promised in April to focus more on Tesla.\n\nNow, Wall Street is worried about Trump's hitting back at Musk through Tesla.\n\n\"Trump is tit for tat. If Musk tries to mess up Trump's bill, Trump won't be Mr Nice Guy\" when it comes to self-driving cars, which Musk acknowledges are a key to Tesla's future, said Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities.\n\nTesla's heavy losses partially reverse a big run-up in the eight weeks since Musk confirmed that Tesla would test an autonomous, driverless \"robotaxi\" service in Austin, Texas, this month.\n\nInvestors fear Trump might not be in such a rush to usher in a future of self-driving cars in the US, and that could slam Tesla because so much of its future business depends on that.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump says after Xi call that US and China will resume trade talks \ufeff\n\nThe president and the richest man in the world together during happier times. (Bloomberg)\n\n\"The whole goal of robotaxis is to have them 20 or 25 cities next year,\" Ives said. \"If you start to heighten the regulatory environment, that could delay that path.\"\n\nTrump's threat to cut government contracts seem targeted more to another of Musk's businesses, SpaceX, his privately held rocket company that received billions of dollars to send astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, provide launches and do other work for NASA.\n\nThe company is currently racing to develop a mega rocket for the space agency to send astronauts to the moon next year.\n\nA subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk's once-close relationship with the president.\n\nOn a trip with Trump to the Middle East last month, Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved his satellite service for aviation and maritime use.\n\nThough its not clear how much politics has played a role, a string of other recent deals for the company in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere has come as Trump has threatened tariffs and sent diplomats scrambling to please the president.\n\nOne measure of SpaceX's success: A private financing round followed by a private sale of shares recently reportedly valued it at $US350 billion, up from an estimated $US210 billion just a year ago.\n\nTesla shares initially got a lift from his support of Trump. In the weeks after Trump was elected, Tesla shares surged, hitting an all-time high on December 17.",

        "text": "The silence had become deafening.\n\nThe absence of any news out of north London creating rumour and intrigue.\n\nWith Ange Postecoglou and Daniel Levy both on holiday, the vacuum created its own ominous void.\n\nAnd yet the longer the gap between that heady night in Spain that ended Spurs' lengthy trophy drought and any news one way or another from the club about the Australian's coaching future, the more it seemed as though Postecoglou's time would be up.\n\n'Mic drop': Ange told you he always wins a trophy in his second season Photo shows Ange Postecoglou holds his hand on his chest When Spurs hired Ange Postecoglou, he was seen as an alternative to the \"winners\" who had gone before him. Now he's backed up his pre-season statement of always winning a trophy in his second season to silence the doubters. Again.\n\nHow can Spurs get rid of a man who has delivered exactly what he said he would?\n\nThe end of Tottenham's trophy drought could and perhaps should have been Postecoglou's ticket to a third season at the helm.\n\nHowever, in the cold light of day, Postecoglou was always going to be hard pressed to keep his job.\n\nYes, the euphoric scenes in Bilbao painted a picture of a team that had suddenly achieved something few thought they would.\n\nAnd yes, the backing of his players in recent weeks had created a deafening roar of ascent amidst the screaming void of nothingness from the boardroom.\n\nBut the facts don't lie.\n\nA brilliant start, a horror finish\n\nAnge Postecoglou was well liked by his players. (Getty Images: Danehouse/Harry Murphy)\n\nThings at Spurs started so well for Postecoglou.\n\nUnbeaten in their first 10 league games of the 2023/24 season, they were five points clear at the top of the Premier League table before a chaotic defeat to Chelsea scuppered their progress.\n\nThat was the best start to a Premier League season by any new manager in the league's history (since 1992) and was Tottenham's best start in the top flight since 1960/61.\n\nThen, Spurs managed just one draw in their next five matches, the worst form of any team in the top division, bringing Postecoglou back down to earth with a bump.\n\nThat Chelsea defeat was more than just the start of a slide though; it epitomised everything that pundits have since claimed has been Postecoglou's problem all along, the stick with which he has been beaten into submission.\n\n\"It is just who we are mate,\" Postecoglou said after his nine-man team was overwhelmed, its high defensive line mercilessly and repeatedly exposed by Chelsea's pacy forwards.\n\nAnge Postecoglou had some superb moments with Spurs, but the trend was going in the wrong direction. (Getty Images: Liverpool FC)\n\nHis stubborn rigidity to his tactical ideals, despite the disruption caused by one of (note, one of, not the) worst injury tolls in the league, saw Spurs tumble back down to earth with an almighty thud.\n\nSpurs finished 17th in the Premier League this season, suffering a whopping 22 defeats, their worst top-flight season since 1976/77.\n\nWith a sizeable playing budget at his disposal \u2014 estimated as being the seventh highest in the Premier League \u2014 that is simply not good enough.\n\nOver the course of his two-year tenure though, the picture is far rosier.\n\nIf we combine the last two seasons into one 76-match campaign, Spurs would sit eighth.\n\nThe devil though, is in the detail.\n\nAfter the first 19 Premier League games of his time in charge, Spurs were sitting in fifth spot on the Premier League ladder with 11 wins.\n\nThe following 19 games saw Tottenham drop to eighth on the form guide with nine wins.\n\nThe next 19 games, at the start of the 2024/25 season, saw Spurs win just seven games, just good enough for 11th.\n\nThe 19 after that saw just four wins.\n\nAnge Postecoglou had struggled in the league, with a woeful finish of 17th the nadir. (Getty Images: Stu Forster)\n\n\"Following a positive start in the 2023/24 Premier League (PL) season, we recorded 78 points from the last 66 PL games,\" a Spurs statement read, the appalling numbers laid bare.\n\nIf Postecoglou's first 10 games were among the best in Premier League history, that stands all the more glaringly against his final 10 games in charge where he won just a single game, with one draw.\n\nAnge's rise from the failed dream of the NSL to European glory Photo shows Ange Postecoglou holds a trophy In 2008, Ange Postecoglou was a Fox Sports pundit who felt unemployable. Now he's the first Australian football manager to win a major European club trophy.\n\nThat run of four points over the 10-game period was second only to Southampton as the worst in the league.\n\nThis inexorable slide has not gone unnoticed and, despite enjoying the backing of the players, shifting that momentum is always going to be tough and, in the cut and thrust world of the Premier League, there is little room for error.\n\n\"At times there were extenuating circumstances \u2014 injuries and then a decision to prioritise our European campaign,\" Spurs said in its statement.\n\n\"It is crucial that we are able to compete on multiple fronts and believe a change of approach will give us the strongest chance for the coming season and beyond.\"\n\nSpurs' late-season form was dire\n\nThe sky had been closing in on Spurs due to their horror league form. (Getty Images: MB Media/Vince Mignott)\n\nPostecoglou said he had thrown everything he had at the Europa League to the detriment of the league. But finishing so low is an appalling reflection of where the club is at.\n\nSpurs managed just 11 wins in the Premier League this season, all but four of those coming against clubs in the bottom half of the table.\n\nOf teams that finished in the top half of the table, only Brentford twice (10th), Aston Villa (sixth) and Manchester City (3rd) were beaten by Spurs, with other victories coming against relegated Southampton (twice) and Ipswich, as well as Everton (13th), Manchester United twice (15th) and West Ham United (14th).\n\nEven digging into these fixtures highlights issues.\n\nEverton were a basket case at the start of the year, which is when Spurs played them, while the away victory over Manchester City came slap bang in the middle of the defending champions' dire run of form where they lost seven games in a row in across competitions.\n\nIn the cups, things were only slightly better.\n\nIt seemed, in the league at least, that Ange Postecoglou had no answers. (Getty Images: Marc Atkins)\n\nNon-league Tamworth were the only team Spurs managed to beat in the FA Cup and even that victory required extra time. While in the League Cup, lower league Coventry, both Manchester clubs and Liverpool were beaten in one-off matches.\n\nEven the Europa League triumph, as giddy and joyous as it appeared in Seville, when looked at in the cold light of day was hardly something to scream at.\n\nSince the restructure of the Champions League, there is no doubt that it has become easier in Europe's second-tier competition.\n\nNo longer are the teams that finish in third place in the Champions League group phase parachuted into the competition, making the overall standard that much lower.\n\nWins over Qaraba\u011f, Ferencv\u00e1ros, AZ, Elfsborg and Hoffenheim should have, in truth, been expected given Tottenham's far superior resources.\n\nVictory over Eintracht Frankfurt, which finished in third place in the Bundesliga, over two legs in the quarterfinal was impressive.\n\nBut Bod\u00f8/Glimt? As tough as it is to play on an artificial pitch north of the Arctic Circle, the budget disparity between the two clubs makes David's biblical contest against Goliath look like a reasonable piece of matchmaking.\n\n\"Whilst winning the Europa League this season ranks as one of the Club's greatest moments, we cannot base our decision on emotions aligned to this triumph,\" Spurs said, revealing its cold-hearted pragmatism.\n\n\"This has been one of the toughest decisions we have had to make and is not a decision that we have taken lightly, nor one we have rushed to conclude.\n\n\"We have made what we believe is the right decision to give us the best chance of success going forward, not the easy decision.\"\n\nWhat next for Ange?\n\nAnge Postecoglou will likely be in demand as a top-level coach. (Getty Images: Justin Setterfield)\n\nIt should not and cannot be understated how impressive it is that Postecoglou won a trophy.\n\nTo boldly state that you always win something in your second season and then deliver on that promise is the ultimate mic drop.\n\nBanishing Spurs' recent history of choking in the biggest moments has been a feat incapable of some of Europe's biggest-name managers.\n\nAnge breaks his silence Photo shows Ange Postecoglou He has chased his impossible dream across clubs and continents. Now, Ange Postecoglou has made it real by coaching Tottenham to glory in the Europa League.\n\nAnge has, undoubtedly, helped make Spurs less Spursy.\n\n\"[Tottenham is] a club that is trying to break free \u2026 [of] this mindset of thinking themselves of as a big club but being the team that everyone else takes the piss out of,\" Sydney Morning Herald football journalist Vince Rugari told ABC's Offsiders last month.\n\n\"They're a joke in England.\n\n\"They've got a manager that 100 per cent recognises what is going on there [at Spurs] and is doing everything he can to break it as well.\n\n\"He's made comments in press conferences, he challenges the narratives that are around about Tottenham Hotspur.\"\n\nGiven the strides Spurs were making, should Postecoglou have been given more time?\n\nAnge Postecoglou has had great success. (Getty Images: AMA/Catherine Ivill)\n\nShould he have been given that chance to test himself against the best in the Champions League?\n\nThe answer to both those questions is probably yes.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nAnd that Spurs have thrown away the only manager that has managed to break their trophyless curse to the wayside might well be the most Spursy thing that they could have done after all.\n\nSacking Postecoglou fits with Tottenham's recent reputation of throwing away promising situations and making life uncomfortable \u2014 or even torturous \u2014 for its supporters.\n\nPostecoglou, as he said repeatedly in his post-match press conference after the Europa League triumph, will be \"fine\".\n\nHe has shown himself to be a winner in every league he has had an extended run in, be it Scotland, Australia, Japan and now England.\n\nPostecoglou's self-confident bullishness counted against him as Tottenham's season descended into the mire, but it is not unfounded.\n\nAny other club will see Postecoglou's availability as a chance for them to pounce on a proven winner.",

(ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\nHe said ECS was getting three times more requests for assistance than a decade ago, many staff were taking stress leave, and he even had to take out a restraining order against a troubled client.\n\nLynne McCosh, an advocate with ECS, said they had almost nowhere to refer people who needed urgent, immediate help.\n\n\"When we have people presenting that are in an extremely heightened state, what [do] we do with them right in that instant, in that moment?\" she said.\n\nNo regular help\n\nVeronica Lavars, better known as \"Click\", has long sought regular mental health support for her daughter.\n\nVeronica Lavars would love her daughter to have access to regular mental health support.

(ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\nMr Meyer said he often tried to put people in contact with Community Mental Health.\n\n\"If we call Community Mental Health [because] we've got someone who's having an episode, we get all sorts of excuses why they can't help us,\" Mr Meyer said.\n\n\"But we get zero support.\"\n\nWhat's available?\n\nWA Country Health Service's (WACHS) Esperance Community Mental Health facility has two psychiatrists, who visit Esperance up to six days a month from Perth.\n\nTwo full time equivalent WACHS psychologists service the entire Goldfields region, which has almost 60,000 residents.\n\nA small number of psychologists also operate privately in Esperance.\n\nThe town has a range of counselling services, including CentreCare, Hope Community Services, ESCARE and Headspace.\n\nThere is a headspace office on Esperance's main street.

(ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\nIn a statement, WA Health Minister Meredith Hammat said she heard the community's concerns.\n\nShe said the Mental Health Commission funded more than $1.4 billion worth of mental health, alcohol and other drug services across the state.\n\nMs Hammat said further funding announcements on mental health for regional West Australians would be made in the state budget, on June 19.\n\n\"We obviously need to continue to make sure that we grow our mental health services right throughout regional Western Australia,\" Premier Roger Cook said.\n\n\" Esperance is no different as part of that mission. \"\n\nFederal Health Minister Mark Butler's spokesperson said it was committed to delivering more than $1 billion for public mental health care and expanding the sector's workforce.\n\nEsperance Care Services staff say they are exhausted by current support needs.

(Supplied: In The Lens Photography)\n\nThese days GleNTi is a two-day extravaganza, with food, dancing, music and plate-smashing filling the busy schedule at Bicentennial Park on the Darwin Esplanade.\n\nMichael Koulianos, president of the Greek Orthodox Community of Northern Australia, which organises GleNTi, said the festival was an annual highlight of Darwin's event calendar.\n\n\"It's a celebration of our Greek heritage, but also of our families, our community and our standing in the NT,\" he said.\n\n\"It brings us all together.

(Suppled: Adobe Stock)\n\nIn a Facebook post, the Kalymnian Brotherhood denied any wrongdoing and said the investigators made \"false accusations\".\n\n\"We want to make it clear our octopus prep was conducted properly and in the correct manner,\" they said.\n\n\" We consider this to be sabotage and we are very strong believers in due process. \"\n\nThe Kalymnian Brotherhood said in the same post the group would not take part in this year's festival as a result.\n\nMr Koulianos said organisers had found a solution and octopus would still be available.\n\n\"We did stay up all night, rang some suppliers [and] local distributors, and found octopus, so we are definitely going to have octopus this GleNTi,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's going to be enough, probably about a tonne.\n\n\"Normally we sell about two tonnes over the GleNTi weekend, but it's going to be enough for people to taste it, let's put it that way\".\n\nGleNTi is being held on Saturday and Sunday at the Bicentenial Park on Darwin's Esplanade.",

We need to make sure those farming systems are actually adapted to the climate they're going to experience moving forward. \"\n\nTom Remenyi says farmers need to adapt now in order to survive a changing climate.

(ABC Central West: Hamish Cole)\n\nAgri Automation managing director Cam Clifford said UV-C was most effective when applied at night.\n\n\"It works by destroying the DNA of the [diseased] cell, so it will damage it to a point that it can't rebuild itself,\" he said.\n\n\"Once those cells are broken down \u2026 they can't rebuild themselves, which essentially controls the disease, as opposed to applying agrochemicals.\n\n\" That has significant benefits for the grower economically, but also from an ecological perspective as well. \"\n\nThe autonomous vehicle allows vignerons to reduce chemical use.

        "text": "This account of the crumbling ties between the president and Musk is based on interviews with 13 people with direct knowledge of the events, all of whom asked for anonymity to describe private discussions. Loading While the relationship had been losing steam over the past several months as Musk clashed with Trump officials, people close to both men said the disagreement over Isaacman accelerated the break-up. Musk had been planning to exit the White House relatively quietly \u2013 before Isaacman\u2019s ouster left him feeling humiliated. Now Musk and Trump, who seemed inseparable at one point, are on opposite sides.\n\nMusk suggested Trump should be impeached. Trump has threatened to cancel government contracts with Musk\u2019s companies. And in recent days, Trump has been telling people close to him that he believes Musk is acting \u201ccrazy\u201d and must be doing drugs. For Musk, there were few positions across the thousands in the federal government that mattered more to him than the head of NASA, because of its critical importance to SpaceX, his rocket business. So it was of great personal benefit to Musk when Trump chose Isaacman \u2013 who has flown to space twice with SpaceX \u2013 to oversee the agency. Trump farewells Elon Musk in the Oval Office on May 30, after the latter\u2019s 130-day stint as a special government employee. Credit: AP Isaacman\u2019s donations to Democrats had not always been a problem. While Trump privately told advisers that he was surprised to learn of them, he and his team had been briefed about them during the presidential transition, before Isaacman\u2019s nomination, according to two people with knowledge of the events.\n\nBut by last Friday, when Trump went through the file containing details of the donations, he clearly had changed his mind. Credit: Illustration: Matt Golding Musk barely mounted a defence of his friend. He was anxious about doing so with other people around, including Sergio Gor, director of the presidential personnel office, who had clashed with Musk over other staffing matters. Musk believed that he would be able to talk to Trump at some point after the gathering, privately. But Musk never got a chance to make his case. In the hours after the Oval Office farewell, Trump decided he would withdraw Isaacman from consideration. Musk was stunned by how fast it all happened.\n\nMusk\u2019s allies have argued privately that Isaacman\u2019s recent donations to Democrats were not ideological and made at the encouragement of senator Mark Kelly, a former astronaut. A spokesperson for the Democratic senator for Arizona declined to comment. Loading As Musk dealt with the fallout from the tanked nomination, he spent part of the weekend outside Missoula in Montana, as a guest at \u201cSymposium\u201d \u2013 an event for tech executives, investors and startup founders thrown by Founders Fund, the venture capital firm founded by Peter Thiel. He mingled with guests at Paws Up, a high-end resort with glamping tents and luxury cabins set on 15,000 hectares of a historic cattle ranch. There, he had a wide-ranging conversation with Thiel, who could sense no coming feud with the president, according to a person familiar with the talks. OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, who has been openly feuding with Musk, also attended, though the two did not speak.\n\nFor Musk, the goings-on in Washington were still top of mind. After spending a day in Montana, he turned his attention in earnest to assailing the top domestic priority of Trump: the Republican bill making its way through Congress that would slash taxes and steer more money to the military and immigration enforcement. Privately and publicly, Musk stewed over the bill, believing that its spending would erase the supposed savings of his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and add to the federal deficit. Some Republican lawmakers had tried to assuage Musk\u2019s fears. On Monday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson walked the billionaire through the bill and said Congress would try to codify the work done by DOGE.\n\nAfter the call, Johnson told associates that he felt Musk was uninformed about the legislation and the congressional process, but that he had been able reason with the world\u2019s richest man, according to a person familiar with the conversation. On Monday evening, Musk still had concerns. He hinted at them on his social platform X, reposting a chart apparently showing the yearly increase in the national debt. \u201cScary,\u201d Musk wrote as a caption. Trump did not respond to Musk\u2019s criticisms of the bill and maintained a light public schedule.\n\nThe Trump-Musk alliance fully ruptured on Thursday, six days after the two men put on the collegial display in the Oval Office. Elon Musk attacked Trump in posts on X on Thursday (Friday AEST). Credit: NurPhoto via Getty Images Musk, who had largely focused his attacks on Republicans in Congress, had started directing more ire at the president. So when Trump was asked about Musk\u2019s comments during a meeting with Friedrich Merz, the new German chancellor, the president finally let loose. He said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in Musk, downplayed the billionaire\u2019s financial support for his presidential campaign and posited that Musk developed \u201cTrump derangement syndrome\u201d after leaving the White House. Musk fired back in real time. Using X, he unleashed a torrent of attacks. He claimed there were references to the president in government documents about Jeffrey Epstein, the sex offender, and indicated his support for the president\u2019s impeachment. He also said Trump\u2019s tariffs would cause a recession by the end of the year.\n\nLoading Later, Trump, using his own social media platform, threatened to cut billions of dollars in federal contracts with Musk\u2019s companies. By Thursday evening, Musk signalled he would be open to de-escalating the fight, while the president seemed to have little interest in an immediate reconciliation. White House officials said Trump had no plans to call Musk. \u201cPresident Trump is the unequivocal leader of the Republican Party, and the vast majority of the country approves of his job performance as president,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. \u201cInflation is down, consumer confidence and wages are up, the jobs report beat expectations for the third month in a row, the border is secure and America is hotter than ever before.\u201d A spokesperson for Musk did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLoading Musk, his allies and even some White House officials now pin the blame on Gor, believing he sabotaged Isaacman as Musk was on his way out. But some close Trump allies say Gor was being unfairly criticised for a decision that ultimately rests with the president. Gor and Musk clashed several times early in Trump\u2019s second term, including at two cabinet meetings, when Musk questioned how swiftly Gor was moving to fill the top ranks of agencies. Musk\u2019s team and Gor\u2019s team often disagreed over personnel and the amount of power that should be given to aides at DOGE. But Gor\u2019s title \u2013 director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office \u2013 does not convey the scope of his influence in the president\u2019s orbit. Gor founded a pro-Trump super political action committee during the 2024 presidential election, and co-founded a publishing house with Donald Trump Jr that has published books by the president and his allies. The president\u2019s aides and allies quickly jumped to Gor\u2019s defence on Friday.",

        "text": "If that was so crucial, how to explain the cards that Postecoglou was asked to play? Why was he given such a thin squad to take into the season, its lack of depth brutally exposed by those injuries? Why was it that Spurs did not support him with another centre-back in the January transfer window until after their third-choice option in that position went down with a season-ending ACL injury, adding to a crisis which had already ripped the heart out of their domestic campaign? Why was their policy of pursuing talented young players \u2013 which, no doubt, will hold them in good stead for the coming years \u2013 not also supported with experience that could have enabled them to compete on multiple fronts, when they absolutely have the financial capacity to do both? Postecoglou knew it wasn\u2019t possible this season, so after January, as he explained in his post-Europa League final press conference, he selected one front and focused on it. His staff and playing group backed him in. He made the calculation that ending the club\u2019s trophy drought was the only way of breaking their psychological chains. He said that not everybody at the club agreed with that decision; we can now safely assume that Levy was one of those people. Levy now has the nerve to talk about \u201cemotions\u201d when there was clear logic at play. Tottenham\u2019s motto is Audere est Facere: To Dare is To Do. Postecoglou dared, and he did. \u201cThe game is about glory,\u201d the legendary Spurs manager Danny Blanchflower once said. He brought them glory, and his reward was the sack. Postecoglou and Spurs chairman Daniel Levy after the Europa League win. Credit: Getty Images\n\nHe deserved the right to have another crack, but that has been taken away from him. This is the first time Postecoglou has been fired mid-contract. Sure, he was let go by Football Federation Australia at the end of his six-year tenure as Australia\u2019s national youth coach, but that was a little different \u2013 his contract was up, and he probably wasn\u2019t going to seek an extension anyway. He has always tried to be the master of his own destiny, but not this time. He will land on his feet. Tottenham\u2019s loss will be another club\u2019s gain. Postecoglou\u2019s reputation has only been enhanced by his time there, his triumph in the Europa League and the way he handled himself throughout. Another team will come for him, and he will win with them. Inter Milan, the beaten UEFA Champions League finalists, could do much worse after their manager Simone Inzaghi decided to take the riches in Saudi Arabia. So could other clubs in Italy, Germany, Spain ... anywhere, really, where they like success. Equally, Postecoglou will feel he has unfinished business in England, and will want to defy the critics who say his brand of football is unsustainable in the Premier League.\n\nAs for Spurs? The hot favourite to take over is Thomas Frank, the Danish manager currently in charge of Brentford. He may prove an excellent fit. Postecoglou has left him an excellent platform to build upon. Loading But Frank has also never won a major trophy in his career. He has never managed a club which has competed in European competitions, or one as big as Tottenham Hotspur. Last season, his team finished 10th in the Premier League, largely due to injuries. He will also have to deal with a playing group that was utterly in Postecoglou\u2019s thrall and reportedly angry with how the club handled his exit. And a board which has made it clear that winning trophies is not enough for them. Tasking him with untying the Gordian knot that is Tottenham Hotspur is a bigger risk than sticking with Postecoglou for a little longer \u2013 but that is their call. Good luck with that.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Seated in the austere confines of the Independent Commission Against Corruption\u2019s witness box, Mark Scott, the former secretary of the NSW Education Department, remembered Anthony Manning as a popular choice as the first chief executive of a new school-building unit back in 2017. Well-connected from his time working for the equivalent health agency, Manning\u2019s name had been floated as a possible candidate by then-education minister Rob Stokes after a suggestion from PwC partner Amy Brown, and the former premier Mike Baird was among his referees. Health minister Brad Hazzard complimented the appointment at the time, Scott recalled, and senior public servants who had worked with Manning gave Scott the impression of someone viewed as \u201ccan-do\u201d and \u201cfocused\u201d. \u201cI received no signals of concern or disquiet,\u201d Scott recalled. There were no \u201cred flags\u201d. Former NSW Education Department secretary Mark Scott leaving the ICAC building. Credit: Dean Sewell But, as the ICAC has heard during a month of evidence in its public probe into Manning\u2019s conduct as head of School Infrastructure NSW between 2017 and last year, alarm bells had been ringing among senior public servants in the Education Department for several years after he landed the job. \u201cSomewhere on the spectrum between a bully and completely corrupt,\u201d is how director of strategic governance Sasha Holley remembered describing Manning to a friend in 2023.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe watchdog announced in April that it would hold a public inquiry to probe allegations Manning and others at School Infrastructure subverted recruitment practices, improperly awarded contracts and misallocated funds to benefit friends and associates during his time at the agency. It is also probing whether Manning and others engaged in \u201creprisal action\u201d against staff who raised concerns. The probe came after Manning\u2019s abrupt departure from the role in February last year. The Sydney Morning Herald first reported his referral to the watchdog in July, as well as concerns over an axed $40 million school building contract awarded by the agency. That Manning was in the ICAC\u2019s sights had been a discomforting discovery for successive education secretaries. Georgina Harrisson, who headed the department from 2021 to 2023, said she became \u201cless assertive\u201d in her attempts to track contractor spending in the agency after being notified of \u201ca need not to disrupt things\u201d because of the probe. Former education minister Rob Stokes and then head of School Infrastructure Anthony Manning at North Kellyville Public School in 2018. Credit: Janie Barrett At the heart of the ICAC inquiry are four contractors, and their relationship with the school building boss; Martin Berry, Stuart Suthern-Brunt, Michael Palassis and Kathy Jones. All four were handed millions of dollars in contracts from the agency during Manning\u2019s time as chief executive via their companies, and all four had personal and professional relationships with him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManning had known Berry since 2006 and organised his buck\u2019s party. He took spin and yoga classes with Suthern-Brunt, and once described Jones as his \u201ccommunications fairy godmother\u201d. In 2017, he and Palassis were part of a group trying to develop a \u201ccancer wellness\u201d hospital in China close to the time his company, Paxon, were bidding along with PwC to win a tender with the agency. In total, the four contractors and their associated companies earned some $18 million from NSW taxpayers during Manning\u2019s time in School Infrastructure. But the inquiry has also laid bare a culture in which contingent workers on astronomical wages rode roughshod over the established bureaucracy \u2013 some 1,400 contractors were paid more than $344 million between 2017 and 2024, a figure which does not include the sums paid to Manning\u2019s associates \u2013 and where officials who raised concerns about breaches of procurement rules were often swept aside. Andrea Patrick appears as a witness at the ICAC. Credit: ICAC It was an agency in which, at least according to some witnesses, the normal rules did not apply. Andrea Patrick, a senior procurement officer at the department who was fired by Manning, alleged that at a meeting in 2017 he \u201cmade a comment along the lines of \u2018I don\u2019t need you or services or policies\u2019.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManning, she claimed, told her he had a \u201cdirect line\u201d to ministers and said words to the effect of \u201cif I need to do things different, I just pick up the phone to them, and they\u2019ll sort it\u201d. Running through the inquiry is a sense Manning believed he was brought in to the building unit to shake up a flailing department. Loading With a $2.6 billion funding injection for new school infrastructure coming, there was concern at senior levels of the NSW government that that current leadership wouldn\u2019t be able to get the job done, Scott recalled. Stokes, who was education minister when the agency was set up but is not accused of any wrongdoing, described a feeling of \u201cexasperation\u201d with the department over issues such as a new high-rise school, Arthur Phillip in Parramatta, which was plagued by cost blow-outs and delays. The agency was established in 2017 as the state\u2019s public schools were facing an explosion in enrolments and overcrowding was hitting primary and high schools. At the time Stokes described the new unit as \u201ca centre of excellence for assets and their delivery\u201d in response to \u201cchanges around population growth, new ways of teaching and learning, and social change\u201d. But from very early in his tenure, the behaviour which ICAC is now probing began to emerge. Only six weeks into the job, ICAC has heard, Manning spoke to his former boss and friend, Martin Berry, about engaging him and his company, Heathwest Advisory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManning and Berry had known each other since about 2006, ICAC has heard, and in his first round of evidence to the commission last week, Berry conceded the two were friends. He gave Manning a job in the Sydney office of consulting firm Turner & Townsend and the two men often socialised together. Manning organised Berry\u2019s buck\u2019s party and attended his wedding, and in text messages dating back to 2015 they bantered about England\u2019s success in the cricket \u2013 both are from that country \u2013 and arranged to catch up for dinner and drinks near their homes on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches. They also discussed work, and Berry admitted Manning had helped get him a job at Health Infrastructure NSW. But, he also said the men \u201ckept our relationship at a professional level\u201d. \u201cSorry, just, what do you mean by that?\u201d counsel assisting the inquiry Jamie Darams asked during the examination. \u201cWell, we recognised that there would be occasions where we might be in roles that would need to be seen to be maintaining a professional relationship,\u201d Berry responded. Two weeks after their meeting in 2017, ICAC has heard, Berry sent Manning a \u201cproposed scope of works\u201d to his private email address. The schools\u2019 boss then passed on Berry\u2019s wording to several of his staff \u2013 without telling them where it had come from \u2013 and a similar document was issued as a \u201crequest for quotations\u201d from the agency which Heathwest Advisory went on to win. In other words, as Darams put it, Berry drafted the scope of work put out to a tender that his own company was then awarded, giving it an \u201cobvious advantage\u201d over its competitors.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size In the middle of practically nowhere - six hours\u2019 drive west of Sydney, five hours\u2019 drive north of Melbourne - lies the best-kept secret in Australian soccer. Maybe Australian sport. Griffith, NSW, is a place that shouldn\u2019t exist. Without irrigation, it would be a desert - dry, flat, and empty. But in 1916, as part of the bold, utopian Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area scheme, it was built from scratch as a planned city, designed by Walter Burley Griffin, the same American architect who laid out Canberra. The early settlers, mostly returned servicemen and British migrants, struggled with the land; it wasn\u2019t until the Italians arrived, bringing with them generations of agricultural know-how and a relentless work ethic, that the region truly began to bloom. Today, around 60 per cent of the city\u2019s 25,000 residents are said to claim some degree of Italian heritage, and it shines through in everything they do. Top-notch Italian eateries line the city\u2019s main drag, Banna Avenue; walking into the famous old La Scala restaurant, down a dingy, dimly lit staircase, was like stumbling into a dinner scene from Goodfellas. The local wine scene is quietly excellent; Yellow Tail, Australia\u2019s leading export brand and a bona fide global phenomenon, is produced in Yenda, which is a 13-minute drive to the east.

Credit: Destination NSW Season two of Underbelly was also partially set in Griffith, harking back to a darker past that has unfairly coloured the town\u2019s reputation. And then, of course, there\u2019s the soccer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe standard of play at Griffith\u2019s grassroots is surprisingly high given its geographic isolation. The passion for the game is strong, and it has to be, considering the immense obstacles that need to be overcome just to take part. To play at any serious level is to accept many, many hours of driving for hundreds of kilometres just to find an opponent. In football, as in agriculture, Griffith\u2019s best produce ends up elsewhere. If you happen to be decent - like Brisbane Roar youngster Pearson Kasawaya, or former national league players such as Michael Musitano, Eliza Ammendolia or Jordan Jasnos - you eventually have to move to the big smoke to pursue your dreams. \u2018A big family affair\u2019 Griffith\u2019s biggest and most successful club is Yoogali Soccer Club, named for the small township on the city\u2019s eastern fringes, towards Yenda. It was formed in 1954 out of the Yoogali Club, one of Australia\u2019s oldest ethnic social clubs, which was where members of Sydney\u2019s Italian community visited for inspiration before founding Club Marconi - though it no longer plays there, having linked up with the Griffith Leagues Club down the road years ago. (That\u2019s why there\u2019s a second team based in Yoogali, known as Yoogali Football Club; the schism between \u2018YSC\u2019 and \u2018YFC\u2019 would require a whole book to properly explain.) Yoogali has won 34 first-grade titles in various competitions and regularly hosts teams from Sydney for pre-season matches. Tom Sermanni used to bring the Matildas there regularly for training camps during his first two stints as national team boss and spoke at Yoogali\u2019s season launch at the start of this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Yoogali Club.

Luke Santolin is the current coach of Yoogali\u2019s senior men\u2019s team. His grandfather (or nonno) No\u00e9 was one of the club\u2019s founding fathers - the field at the Yoogali Club is named for him - and his father Tony used to coach, and still plays. \u201cThey used to play after church with all the Italian immigrants, and it just grew from there,\u201d Santolin says. \u201cLike most football club stories, they were doing everything: they were cutting the grass, they were painting the lines, putting the nets up, all that jazz. It was a big family affair back then. My two boys have just started playing now. It\u2019s really all I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d One of Yoogali\u2019s earliest soccer teams, from the 1950s. Credit: Yoogali SC Yoogali has an itinerant soccer history, through no fault of their own. Far too big for the local league in Griffith, they have spent decades trying to find somewhere to play, only to be consistently rebuffed. They\u2019ve played in Shepparton (twice), Wagga Wagga, a short-lived Regional Premier League involving other Victorian teams, and most notably, in Canberra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvariably, other teams get sick of driving to Griffith and find a way to get rid of them, even though they only have to travel once per year, and Yoogali every fortnight. \u201cWe\u2019ve never forfeited a game. Would you believe that? Never,\u201d says Santolin. Griffith\u2019s greatest soccer triumph came in 1971, when a team called Griffith United (an amalgamation of Yoogali and Hanwood FC, their fierce rivals) won the league and cup double in the ACT. They played in front of big, boisterous crowds at home, and then jumped on a bus to Canberra every other weekend to fulfil their away commitments. In that team? Not only Tony Santolin and two Paraguayan brothers, Willie and George Wood, but a 16-year-old Walter Valeri, the father of future Socceroo Carl; his father (Carl\u2019s nonno) was one of Hanwood\u2019s founding members. The Valeris later moved to Canberra for work opportunities. Former Socceroo Carl Valeri (centre) can trace his roots back to Griffith - specifically, to Hanwood FC. Credit: Reuters \u201cThe impossible dream came true,\u201d wrote local newspaper The Area News when Griffith United were crowned champions. \u201cThey trained hard, travelled long distance and fought tenaciously to give this town an enviable soccer supremacy. They won and thoroughly deserved it.\u201d The next year, they were kicked out for administrative reasons. For the past five years, Yoogali has been competing in Canberra again, as part of the Capital Football system. In 2023, they won promotion to the top-flight NPL - putting them technically just one step below the A-League - and then last year, defied the odds to stay up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike their opponents, they don\u2019t pay their players - although they do have a long, proud history of sourcing players from overseas, particularly from Scotland. They don\u2019t get paid either, but the club does cover their airfares and finds them work in Griffith (picking fruit, usually, at first) and a place to live. Some of them never go back. \u201cI remember as a kid growing up, my grandparents had a granny flat at the back of their house where the overseas players would live in,\u201d Santolin says. \u201cI remember going to kick the ball with them and then seeing them play for Yoogali on a Sunday. We got to a level where players were calling us, saying they\u2019d heard from a mutual friend or a contact about our club, and how do they come out? You only get that reputation by conducting yourselves the right way. Some of my best friends ever started off as visa players, and now they\u2019ve got three, four kids, a wife, a business, when originally they just came over to kick a ball. So it\u2019s pretty special.\u201d This year\u2019s team features five members of the Donadel family who, like the Santolins, are Yoogali royalty. Two of them are sons of Sante Donadel, assistant coach, former first-grade coach and a former player for over 50 years. The Donadels moved to Griffith in 1970; Sante\u2019s father played for Yoogali, and made life-long friends at the club, and his uncle was coach of Griffith United when they did the double in \u201971. \u201cWe\u2019re still learning, as players, coaches and our committee, how to deal with that level of football, the NPL,\u201d Donadel says. \u201cIt\u2019s by far the best comp we\u2019ve played in. But it\u2019s been good. We\u2019re one of the only [regional] clubs to have ever done something like this.\u201d Things have been tracking well on the field. They recently smashed last season\u2019s premiers, Gungahlin United, 5-1.\n\nAdvertisement",

We should like to express our gratitude to him. We wish him well for the future \u2014 he will always be welcome back at our home.\"\n\n\n\n'Something I will never forget'\n\nPostecoglou also issued a statement, saying: \"When I reflect on my time as manager of Tottenham Hotspur, my overriding emotion is one of pride.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The opportunity to lead one of England's historic football clubs and bring back the glory it deserves will live with me for a lifetime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sharing that experience with all those who truly love this club and seeing the impact it had on them is something I will never forget.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That night in Bilbao was the culmination of two years of hard work, dedication and unwavering belief in a dream. There were many challenges to overcome and plenty of noise that comes with trying to accomplish what many said was not possible.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Who is Ange Postecoglou? How a Greek immigrant is conquering the football world\n\nTottenham face backlash\n\nPostecoglou's sacking sparked shock and outrage as the football world digested the news that a man who had ended his club's long search for silverware had been shown the door a fortnight later.\n\n\n\n\n\nEngland manager Thomas Tuchel, himself sacked by Chelsea a year after winning the Champions League in 2021, said: \"It just shows you that it is not only about titles, you can survive seasons without titles if your connection, the support and the belief and the trust between the coach and the club is strong then you can overcome seasons without titles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If there is slight disbelief, if there are concerns, if the trust is not there anymore, obviously then it is sometimes not even enough to win a trophy after so many years.\"\n\n\n\n",

He would be very proud of that. And he was a very proud man. He came from a very, very wealthy family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity is at the heart of this small business.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Menaras say it\u2019s a place people come to meet and chat and connect with culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nSonia: \"The customers that have come in, they've made friends with people that they didn't know.\n\n\n\n\n\nJohn: \"Greeks, Italians, everyone. Everyone got really well together.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking Italian with customers is also appreciated, says Sonia Menara - especially by one older woman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She is lovely, and has been a customer for the last 45 years. I'll go up and I speak to her in Italian and she orders her cake. It does make people feel like home and the connection; that they come in here and there is someone that will understand them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that John Menara was born in Australia and has never been to Italy \u2013 yet his family business has a cosy European feel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's how I wanted to connect with my ancestry back in Italy. It was to put Italy on the walls with artwork and everything else. It makes me feel good.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat sense of culture and community a few of the reasons High Street holds the honour as the world\u2019s coolest \u2013 as voted by Time Out Magazine.\n\n\n\n\n\nMelbourne Editor Leah Glynn explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"High Street really ticks all the boxes. It's got really epic restaurants, cute hidden bars, great boutiques, and a really wonderful community spirit. It beat out 30 other streets, which is an amazing achievement for High Street in Melbourne on a global scale. And I think it really just goes to show that Melbourne's offerings are truly world-class.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Historian Emma Russell agrees:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because of the diversity, I think it does represent a lot of what's so fantastic about Melbourne. It's not just retail, it's community organisations, community activities that look after people or that provide cultural activities for people from all ranges of backgrounds.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd perhaps nowhere is the diversity of food and cultures more evident than at Preston Market.\n\n\n\n\n\nVendor Sam Virgona has run his market fruit and vegetable store for more than 50 years, since migrating from Sicily in the '60s.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says for many customers, it\u2019s a place that feels like home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They come here and they like to shop in the market. They like to talk to a friend. They enjoy to come here!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKey to that is making people from all countries and backgrounds feel welcome, says John Zaccharia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are here. A group of us come in and have a coffee, have a chat, and we had a good time. We are very, very polite people. We welcome everybody. If we get a chair open, we're available. We'll let them stay with us. We're talking about gardening, football and everything else. Two things we don't like to talk about, and this is the rule, no politics and no religion.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat inclusive spirit also celebrated by second-generation butcher Mark Tolio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I grew up in the market from a young age. I would come in, I got to meet many people, many different characters and it's like one big family. And even the people you work with, you get a good relationship. And I love the market.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there\u2019s much more to High Street than markets and cafes, says historian Emma Russell.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong the two kilometre stretch from Preston, through Thornbury to Northcote, the heritage shopfronts sell everything from vintage records to clothing - their facades plastered with colourful street art.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's very eclectic. It's got representation of most of the migrant communities that have come to Melbourne over the last 100 or so years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWaves of migration also brought food and flavours from Europe, the Middle East and more recently Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndonesian restaurant Yuni\u2019s Kitchen is run by Matthew and Yuni Kenwrick.\n\n\n\n\n\nYuni: \"So I come to Melbourne my food adventure is more bigger about Indonesian.\n\n\n\n\n\nMathew: \"It's all done from scratch. So that's the part where if you make the curry base from the beginning, chopping every onion up, every chili up, grinding it up, cooking it, and serving it. We get a lot of overseas people, they're very excited to try something wholly different from what they normally get.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYuni and Matthew Kenwrick say as the urban landscape evolves, everyone is welcome here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whether you are old, young, dressed like a goth, just arrive from overseas, don't speak much English. There's so much opportunity to shop and eat and let people be what they want to be.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChange is something the Menaras have also embraced over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\nSonia and John are stepping back now, but their children are proud to keep the family business going, as Gianni Menara explains:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My sister and I are very proud of our history. Taking over the reins from mum and dad. We're very proud and humble as well. And we put our heart and soul pretty much into everything we do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a winning recipe the Menara family \u2013 and many others \u2013 hope will ensure their success for another 50 years at least!\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's just been a beautiful ride, I've got to say. In these years that we've been here. We're very proud. I mean, we couldn't have done it without each other - and the kids.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "For decades, the United States has been a reliable ally to Australia, whose protection has helped to ensure peace in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut US President Donald Trump's unpredictable and tough treatment of his nation's allies has raised questions about whether Australia can still afford to lean so heavily on America as a security partner.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters the government will make decisions in Australia's national interest and fund the defence capability it needs . The comments came after US defence secretary Pete Hegseth requested Australia increase its defence budget to 3.5 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in a conversation with Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore last weekend.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why Xi Jinping is touring Southeast Asia amid rising tariff tensions\n\nAustralia's defence budget makes up roughly 2 per cent of GDP, which the government plans to increase to 2.35 per cent by 2034.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile most experts do not believe the US will withdraw from the Indo-Pacific, Trump's actions raise questions about whether Australia should be seeking to cooperate more with other nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, raised the prospect of a formal defence agreement between the trading bloc and Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, Albanese said he would consider the proposal but noted a similar agreement was already in place with other European countries such as Germany.\n\n\n\nThe European Union raised the prospect of a security pact with Australia in May. Source: AAP / Sipa USA Without the US alliance, Peter Dean, director of foreign policy and defence at the United States Studies Centre at The University of Sydney, says Australia would need to massively increase its defence spending or accept it can't defend its own sovereignty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you look at the mismatch between the scale of our territory and the scale of our ability to defend it \u2014 it's one of the most glaring mismatches in the world,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[You would] effectively be just hoping for the best.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDean says Australia needs to work hard to maintain its security and that a \"community of nations\" is necessary to support open and free trade, promote a rules-based international order, and counter the use of coercion, aggression, and military force to achieve political objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you don't have that community of nations, the example of what's happening in Ukraine is very poignant to everybody,\" he says.\n\n\n\n[Russia believes] in a 'might is right' world and they believe in a world where they get to shape those rules and that order, and that is not going to be favourable or in Australia's interests ... or for the majority of states in our region.\n\nCan we still rely on America?\n\nDean says Trump is more brutally transactional than previous presidents and an example of the adage in international relations that \"you have no friends, you only have common interests\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it's not always clear what Trump's interests are, Dean believes there's still a common alignment between Australia and the US, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, and in the overall aims and objectives of their security policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That simply boils down to \u2014 we don't want an Indo-Pacific that's dominated by one particular power \u2014 especially China,\" Dean says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is an Australian view clearly articulated in our strategy, and that is a US view, clearly articulated by the US \u2014 even under this president.\"\n\n\n\nProfessor Peter Dean says there's a common alignment between Australia and the US, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, as well as in their overall objectives for security policies. Source: AAP / Tatan Syuflana/AP One of the potential problems with a China-dominated region, Dean says, is its desire to \"rule by law\" and the way in which China would go about setting and enforcing laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China particularly wants a hierarchical order where it sits on top and everyone else sits underneath,\" he says.\n\n\n\nChina has one of the most powerful militaries in the world and is seeking to dominate the Indo-Pacific region. Source: SBS News In contrast, Australia and other like-minded countries support a \"rule of law\" system in which a community of nations jointly sets the rules through treaties, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Sam Roggeveen, the director of the international security program at the Lowy Institute, says the US has done very little to address China's dramatic military modernisation since the end of the Cold War.\n\n\n\nNo matter who's in charge in the US, I don't think that will rescue Australia from having to think much more independently about its security.\n\n\"The harsh truth for Australia and for other allies in the region is that the Americans aren't going to do the heavy lifting for us, and want us to do it ourselves.\"\n\n\n\nDoes Australia need the US?\n\nDean says the alliance with the US is critical for national security, and forming an agreement with other countries would be very difficult.\n\n\n\n\n\nA strategic alliance involves countries committing to help each other out during a crisis, or to act in accord to address a common threat. This would preferably be set out in a treaty.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has an alliance with the US and New Zealand, but despite being part of the British Commonwealth, it does not have a formal agreement with the United Kingdom.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the geographical distance, Dean believes military support from the UK would likely depend on what other conflicts are happening in its part of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to international alliances, arguably the most important is NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), which commits Europe and North America to protecting each other from any threat.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Joe Biden: NATO's time 'has not passed' SBS News 12/07/2024 10:12 Play\n\nRory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at The Australian National University, says there are three crucial elements to establish in alliances. Firstly, there must be clear interests in common. Secondly, the parties must articulate some shared values or political will to provide a foundation for trust.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If their security is threatened, then you have interests engaged,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there must also be mutual capability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's not much point being an ally of someone if you bring nothing to the table and they bring everything,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nDean says no other state can replace the size, power and influence of the US, which is the world's number one military power.\n\n\n\nThe US has the most powerful military in the world. Source: SBS News Dean says the US \u2014 by partnering with South Korea, Australia, Japan and other states \u2014 can aggregate enough power to balance China's influence and there is no \"ready-made state\" that could easily replace it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout the US, Medcalf says China would likely seek to dominate countries one by one and break any alliance-like relationships.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if Australia did more for its own defence, there would still be a good argument for maintaining a close relationship with the US because its military technology is among, if not the best in the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Roggeveen says Australia has to accept the US alliance is going to become less important over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With that in mind, we have to look geographically much closer to home,\" he says.\n\n\n\nBuilding coalitions\n\nWhile forming a new alliance may prove difficult, Medcalf says it would be possible for Australia to build coalitions with other nations to discourage things like coercive behaviour if there was some degree of confidence the US would still back them up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really about using strategic partnership to make ourselves stronger, rather than building a kind of alliance where we expect to be standing shoulder to shoulder in war,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia is already part of several small groupings of nations with common interests in the Indo-Pacific, such as The Quad (a diplomatic partnership among the US, India, Japan and Australia) and AJUS (a trilateral partnership among Australia, Japan and the US).\n\n\n\n\n\nDefence cooperation has deepened via AJUS, while the security partnership AUKUS, which exists between Australia, the UK and the US, has laid the groundwork for Australia to acquire nuclear-powered submarines and other advanced capabilities.\n\n\n\nAustralia has also entered into limited bilateral agreements with Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, Singapore and others.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedcalf, who is undertaking nationwide consultations to understand Australian attitudes to security, says most of these countries have no prospect of being treaty allies of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut partnerships with countries like Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Vietnam may be possible. All of these countries, apart from Vietnam, are already American allies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They have different levels of capability that they would bring to the table,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But the ultimate question is how much risk are we all going to take for each other?\"\n\n\n\nAustralian Defence Minister Richard Marles (centre) with Philippine defence secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr (left) and Australian ambassador to the Philippines Hae Kyong Yu (right) in 2023 prior to a large-scale combined amphibious assault exercise in the Philippines. Source: AAP / Philippine DND Defense Communications Service and AFP Public Affairs Office/AP\n\nShould Australia consider a defence agreement with the European Union?\n\nDue to the number of member states that would need to agree to it, Medcalf suspects an agreement with the EU would likely be quite vague in its language and commitment.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may focus on increased technology sharing, access to defence industry resources and possibly some intelligence sharing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere could also be some aspirational statements about the rules-based order, or the intent to discourage and oppose aggressive action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But it would fall far short of anything resembling a treaty commitment,\" Medcalf says.\n\n\n\n\n\nDean agrees it's more likely Australia and the EU would support each other diplomatically to uphold rules and standards both in Europe and the Indo-Pacific.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What is the European Union and what does it do?\n\nMedcalf points out Australia and many northern European countries share common values, including freedom of expression, the rule of law and secularism in politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Australia's political values] are much closer to countries like Denmark, Sweden and Finland than to any of our neighbours except New Zealand,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has previously manufactured a Norwegian-designed naval strike missile and German-designed armoured fighting vehicles. The EU could offer access to other sophisticated capabilities such as warships, drones and sensors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The risk is obviously an expectation that Australia becomes more involved in Europe security problems ... obviously that's about confronting Russia,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Medcalf believes Australia should be helping countries like Ukraine to defend themselves, there are limitations.\n\n\n\nWhat we shouldn't be doing is ever raising the expectation that we could be a frontline military actor on the other side of the world.\n\nMedcalf says Europe is in a different region to Australia, and it would be difficult to deploy troops or aircraft to each other's front lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Europe is highly trade-dependent and large countries like Germany and France, in particular, have an interest in maintaining the security of shipping in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, he says, adding that a significant number of shipping companies are also European.\n\n\n\nThe shipping route between Europe and China through the South China Sea.

Source: SBS News Other experts are sceptical about the potential for a quasi-alliance with Indonesia.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Medcalf agrees Australia should do more with Indonesia \u2014 including to help strengthen its navy and air force, and its ability to monitor what's happening in its waters \u2014 he notes its policy is to be \"friends to all, enemies to none\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Which sounds great but in practice means that Indonesia is working very hard to be as neutral as it can be in future crisis situations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says Indonesia has not been willing to speak out about China's behaviour in the South China Sea and doesn't have the capability to help Australia build its own defence technology base.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia also has to accept that China already has a strong influence in Indonesia, he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're looking for a country that can partly fill the gap that the US may leave \u2014 I'd be looking to Japan before Indonesia. But if Indonesia ends up getting closer to our point of view, that would be wonderful,\" he says.\n\n\n\nJapan\n\nMedcalf says some experts already characterise Japan's relationship with Australia as a quasi-alliance, and it is the most likely country to form an actual alliance with Australia, although the chances of this happening in the short term remain unlikely.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says both Japan and Australia share a strong belief in a rules-based system, and have different strengths they could bring to the table.\n\n\n\nThey need the resources that we have. We need their technology, we need their investment.\n\nMedcalf doesn't think Japan's peace constitution \u2014 put in place at the end of World War Two to maintain its military for defensive purposes only \u2014 would be an impediment because politicians have been reinterpreting it over the last 20 years or so.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Japan is already moving away from 1 per cent, to 2 per cent of GDP, as its military budget,\" he says, adding that Japanese forces are increasingly training in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Dean believes legal and cultural barriers still make it unlikely Japan will form an alliance with Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But I think if the region was to have some type of strategic shock, or it was to really start to deteriorate, that would drive that alignment even closer together,\" he says.\n\n\n\nSome experts consider Japan is already in a quasi-alliance with Australia. Source: SBS News\n\nVietnam\n\nMedcalf says Vietnam is very good at maintaining a balanced relationship with China because it knows how to stand up to China, while also keeping the peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They've been doing both for about 1,000 years,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Vietnam] can defend itself, but it can also do diplomacy well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Medcalf says the Southeast Asian country would be very reluctant to enter into a treaty-like commitment with Australia, although there is potential for more cooperation in areas such as military training.\n\n\n\nSingapore\n\nSingapore has long been a valuable diplomatic partner for Australia and already cooperates on military training and exchanging information, Medcalf says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But Singapore is ultimately a very self-interested and neutral country and I think we would work with them as much as we could without the expectation that either would actually take a risk on the other's behalf.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he would put Malaysia in a similar camp.\n\n\n\nAustralian and Indonesian army tanks taking part in multi-national military exercises in Indonesia in 2023. Source: AAP / Tatan Syuflana/AP\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSouth Korea is a militarily significant country because it has a lot of capability, Medcalf says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They now export defence equipment to Europe,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"South Korea is one of the few countries in the world that is genuinely able to do rapid military manufacturing at scale.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the problem is it's overwhelmingly focused on defending itself against North Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yes, they're slightly concerned about ensuring that China doesn't dominate the region. Yes, they're a US ally but they would probably be reluctant to project much further beyond the peninsula,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedcalf says South Korea also has quite deep-seated political problems domestically, and its politics can be unpredictable.\n\n\n\nIndia\n\nMedcalf says Australia's relationship with India has advanced significantly over the past decade \u2014 with each country's navy training together frequently and sharing information. Both countries' air forces jointly monitor the Indian Ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[India] will probably be \u2014 within the next few decades \u2014 one of the three biggest powers in the world militarily, alongside the US and China.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Medcalf says India is diplomatically very neutral and greatly values its autonomy.\n\n\n\nThey're not going to be forming permanent alliance-like relationships with anyone.\n\nWhile India does not want to witness China dominate the Indian Ocean and would likely align with other countries in the region to balance against China, Medcalf says if it came to war, there would be only very limited circumstances under which it would get involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I guess they would certainly contribute to patrolling the Indian Ocean and potentially limiting China's ability to operate there, but I don't think India is going to be taking a lot of risk on behalf of others,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndia may also expect other countries to come to its aid if there were a conflict with China on its border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And that would be something that I think would be difficult for other countries to think about.\"\n\n\n\nIndia is expected to be one of the biggest military powers within the next few decades, but it values its neutrality. Source: SBS News\n\nPhilippines\n\nThe Philippines is one of the countries that claim parts of the South China Sea, which has led to clashes with China over issues such as fishing rights, islands and territories, Medcalf says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Philippines has traditionally been quite a weak military power but they're beginning to modernise their forces and their location is strategically very important \u2014 they're right at the heart of the sea lanes of Asia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Philippines is an American treaty ally, under former president Rodrigo Duterte, it became closer to China.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedcalf says it would make sense for Australia to have the Philippines as a partner, but caution is needed when considering the limits of its power and whether another change in government could alter dynamics.\n\n\n\nIt's yet another example of how it's a nice idea to try and stitch all of these relationships together into something larger but without the Americans involved somewhere along the line, it still becomes quite flimsy.\n\nThe Philippines has started modernising its military forces. Source: SBS News\n\nCanada\n\nLike Australia, Canada is a middle-sized power but in some ways, it is militarily weaker. It's also a long way away.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Medcalf points out Canada is technically part of the broader Pacific region as its western coastline borders the Pacific Ocean.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also surprisingly active in the region \u2014 supporting the UN efforts in East Asia to prevent illegal trade with North Korea and the smuggling of parts or precursors for weapons of mass destruction.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, you're forced to save some of your income in what's called superannuation, or super for short.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach time you get paid, a minimum of 11.5 per cent of your wage is put into an investment fund, which you can access at retirement.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt hasn't always been that way - before the 1990s, it was dependent on the job you worked, or the agreement you had with your boss as to who received super.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in 1992, former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating changed that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, for the first time in our history, well in advance of reform in other advanced industrial countries, ordinary Australians will be able to build a decent nest egg for their retirement as a result of the policies of the Labor movement.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMandatory superannuation addresses two issues - making sure people have money to live comfortably when they retire, and taking financial pressure off the federal budget. If people have enough saved, they won't be reliant on welfare like the aged pension.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way super is taxed is different to the rest of your income, as Economist from the Grattan Institute Brendan Coates explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Any contributions into super tax at 15 per cent for most people, and then the earnings, whether it be dividends or the interest income from bonds or term deposits, that's also taxed at 15 per cent for most people while they're working, and it's 0 per cent once they retire.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's some exceptions to that rule - high income earners pay 30 per cent on some contributions, and only the first $2 million is tax free at retirement time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you sell something in your superannuation and make a capital gain, that's taxed at 10 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo years ago, Treasurer Jim Chalmers announced the plan to increase taxes on some superannuation balances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm confident that Australians will see this change as modest and reasonable and fair.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd after a landslide election win, Labor is moving to make the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's been a bit controversial - Deputy Liberal Leader Ted O'Brien doesn't like it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Let me be very clear where the coalition stands on this. Labor's super tax is super big and super bad.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor's plan is to double the amount of tax paid on superannuation earnings on balances over $3 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment, those earnings are taxed at 15 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat will stay the same for balances under $3 million, but any earnings on money over that amount will be taxed at 30 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It makes a meaningful difference to the budget, and it helps us fund some of our other priorities. It's all about making sure that the superannuation system is fairer, that it's more sustainable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment, around 80,000 Australians - or 0.5 per cent of people who have an Australian superannuation account, will be impacted.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut its not indexed, which means every year as inflation and wages grow, more people will have to pay the extra tax.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other controversial part of the plan is that it will be applied to unrealised gains.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you invest money, if that investment is worth more than what you put in, it's increased in value.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the gain on the investment is not realised until it's sold - and it's taxed at 10 per cent once that sale happens.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor is proposing that those gains are taxed before the asset is sold.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coalition isn't happy about that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The introduction of unrealised capital gains will be a disaster for the Australian economy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHow that will work is that the government will look at the value of your super and compare it to the year before.\n\n\n\n\n\nAny increase in the balance above $3 million will be taxed at 30 per cent - no matter if the increase is because of realised or unrealised gains.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll the money below $3 million will be taxed the same as before.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have been concerns for business owners, including farmers, who sometimes have their farm or other major assets in their self managed superannuation fund, because if the value of their farm increases they will have to find the money to pay the extra tax whilst they still own it.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past, they wouldn't have had to pay the money until they sold the farm, when they likely have more access to liquid assets.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers says taxing unrealised gains is the only way to calculate the extra tax on some super accounts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The unrealised gains calculation was recommended to us by Treasury. We provided years of opportunities for people to suggest different ways to calculate that liability, and nobody has been able to come up with one.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Labor, these changes will increase revenue, and stop superannuation being a tax-friendly place to store wealth, as Mr Coates explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The typical retiree does not actually spend down their super. They retiree in their 80s has typically got more money in Super two decades after they retire than on the day that they do retire. And you know, Treasury is expecting their forecasting that 1/3 of the money that's withdrawn from Super, you know, by 2060 each year will be in the form of bequests going to the kids.\"\n\n\n\n",

Everyone now, they pay some amount buying sheeps or cows and they give those animals for God, for Allah.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sacrifice of animals pays respect to a story in the Quran, the Christian Bible and the Torah, that of Ibrahim - also known as Abraham - being willing to sacrifice his own son for God.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Egyptian-Australian woman Sahar Badawe, she tells SBS Arabic that her community always celebrates the holiday with the dish fatteh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Eid al-Adha breakfast is always a dish called Fatteh in Egypt consisting of lot of meat and yoghurt. You can\u2019t celebrate Eid Adha without enjoying this special breakfast, even though it\u2019s usually a meal suited for lunch time as it\u2019s rich.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for some Muslim migrants, they've found the Eid experience in Australia to be more difficult to navigate balancing tradition with everyday work routines.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Eid Al-Adha not officially recognised as a public holiday, many families in Australia celebrate around their jobs and school schedules.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity events and weekend gatherings can help keep the spirit alive, but Jordanian-Australian Rania Irani told SBS Arabic it\u2019s not quite the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We don\u2019t really feel the spirit of Eid here, to be honest. Everyone goes about their day as usual. My two sons both have to work and don\u2019t get a day off, so we can\u2019t even go out together. We\u2019ll meet friends on Saturday, but still, it\u2019s not like celebrating in our home country, surrounded by family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Eid festival also coincides with the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\n\n\nPilgrims typically perform the tawaf on Eid, walking seven times around the Kaaba, which is the holiest site in Islam and is said to have been built by the prophet Ibrahim and his son.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne worshipper, Zainab Loo, says the once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage has been indescribable.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite Australia becoming more religiously diverse, there isn't a mainstream Hindu school for 800-thousand people in the country who identify with this faith.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike Hinduism, other major faiths including Islam and Greek Orthodox have schools of their own.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that's about to change.\n\n\n\n\n\nA two hectare block in the northwest of Sydney will be home to Australia's first Hindu school in 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis - as the federal government has pledged $8.5 million dollars in grant funding for the construction of a new school in the suburb of Oakville in the Hawkesbury region.\n\n\n\n\n\nHindu Council of Australia's Vice President Surinder Jain shares how the concept emerged in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the community got together to raise funds and purchase the block last year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Initially it looked like an impossible task, a mammoth task \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever have our own school but then a group of parents came together, raised money and said we are going to start a Hindu school.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2021 census found Hinduism is the third largest religion in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe school will start with Kindergarten to Year Two, and eventually have classes all the way up to Year 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We see no problem in filling kindergarten to Year Two streams, we'll start with one stream initially. Depending on the demand we will add a second or third stream if needed. And once the Year Two students have graduated we will start Year Three so they don't have to change schools.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Jain talks about the aspects of Hinduism that the school will be committing to such as non-violence and good discipline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The first thing to be a good Hindu or a good Christian, or any other faith of that matter is to understand what it is. That's what this school will be teaching. Some of the things which will help non-Hindus as well when they study in the school there will be emphasis on yoga, which is for good physical health and there will be emphasis on meditation which is good mental health.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are around 800-thousand Hindus who call Australia home.\n\n\n\n\n\nRahul Jethi from the Hindu Education and Cultural Centre has told SBS their aim is to inspire the next generation in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe expect to create something which is not just a school for learning, which is a place for people to assemble, to get together and also ensure that the next generation of Australians, Hindu Australians they basically get a lot of inspiration and education from this place.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation Minister Jason Clare has said it will help provide Hindu Australians with the sort of choice that other Australians have - which is to send their children to a school that incorporates their faith and culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nRam Ramaswamy from the Hindu Education and Cultural Centre has told SBS that the development application process is due to begin next month.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says they are estimating the total cost to come in at around $35 million dollars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Not only the elders, or the people who have just been settled in or the new migrants, everybody started chipping in, even now there are new, young students who are contributing $100 per month and this process is continuing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKiran Sampathkumar, from the same centre talks about the commonalities in going to school with someone from the same culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I saw a lot of the boys were able to really, they used to go to the same churches together on a Sunday so they built a brotherhood that I sort of have not seen with Hindu kids in Sydney as yet, so it just provides that safe space for Hindu kids to come and bring the sort of food that you eat at home and you can wear your 'thilak' (*refer to footnote) when you come to school and you're not really going to be afraid someone is going to judge or ask you all these hard questions. You don't need to hide your identity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Anupriya Mehra, it's about instilling in children the importance of valuing their identity.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "This account of the crumbling ties between the president and Musk is based on interviews with 13 people with direct knowledge of the events, all of whom asked for anonymity to describe private discussions. Loading While the relationship had been losing steam over the past several months as Musk clashed with Trump officials, people close to both men said the disagreement over Isaacman accelerated the break-up. Musk had been planning to exit the White House relatively quietly \u2013 before Isaacman\u2019s ouster left him feeling humiliated. Now Musk and Trump, who seemed inseparable at one point, are on opposite sides.\n\nMusk suggested Trump should be impeached. Trump has threatened to cancel government contracts with Musk\u2019s companies. And in recent days, Trump has been telling people close to him that he believes Musk is acting \u201ccrazy\u201d and must be doing drugs. For Musk, there were few positions across the thousands in the federal government that mattered more to him than the head of NASA, because of its critical importance to SpaceX, his rocket business. So it was of great personal benefit to Musk when Trump chose Isaacman \u2013 who has flown to space twice with SpaceX \u2013 to oversee the agency. Trump farewells Elon Musk in the Oval Office on May 30, after the latter\u2019s 130-day stint as a special government employee. Credit: AP Isaacman\u2019s donations to Democrats had not always been a problem. While Trump privately told advisers that he was surprised to learn of them, he and his team had been briefed about them during the presidential transition, before Isaacman\u2019s nomination, according to two people with knowledge of the events.\n\nBut by last Friday, when Trump went through the file containing details of the donations, he clearly had changed his mind. Credit: Illustration: Matt Golding Musk barely mounted a defence of his friend. He was anxious about doing so with other people around, including Sergio Gor, director of the presidential personnel office, who had clashed with Musk over other staffing matters. Musk believed that he would be able to talk to Trump at some point after the gathering, privately. But Musk never got a chance to make his case. In the hours after the Oval Office farewell, Trump decided he would withdraw Isaacman from consideration. Musk was stunned by how fast it all happened.\n\nMusk\u2019s allies have argued privately that Isaacman\u2019s recent donations to Democrats were not ideological and made at the encouragement of senator Mark Kelly, a former astronaut. A spokesperson for the Democratic senator for Arizona declined to comment. Loading As Musk dealt with the fallout from the tanked nomination, he spent part of the weekend outside Missoula in Montana, as a guest at \u201cSymposium\u201d \u2013 an event for tech executives, investors and startup founders thrown by Founders Fund, the venture capital firm founded by Peter Thiel. He mingled with guests at Paws Up, a high-end resort with glamping tents and luxury cabins set on 15,000 hectares of a historic cattle ranch. There, he had a wide-ranging conversation with Thiel, who could sense no coming feud with the president, according to a person familiar with the talks. OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, who has been openly feuding with Musk, also attended, though the two did not speak.\n\nFor Musk, the goings-on in Washington were still top of mind. After spending a day in Montana, he turned his attention in earnest to assailing the top domestic priority of Trump: the Republican bill making its way through Congress that would slash taxes and steer more money to the military and immigration enforcement. Privately and publicly, Musk stewed over the bill, believing that its spending would erase the supposed savings of his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and add to the federal deficit. Some Republican lawmakers had tried to assuage Musk\u2019s fears. On Monday, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson walked the billionaire through the bill and said Congress would try to codify the work done by DOGE.\n\nAfter the call, Johnson told associates that he felt Musk was uninformed about the legislation and the congressional process, but that he had been able reason with the world\u2019s richest man, according to a person familiar with the conversation. On Monday evening, Musk still had concerns. He hinted at them on his social platform X, reposting a chart apparently showing the yearly increase in the national debt. \u201cScary,\u201d Musk wrote as a caption. Trump did not respond to Musk\u2019s criticisms of the bill and maintained a light public schedule.\n\nThe Trump-Musk alliance fully ruptured on Thursday, six days after the two men put on the collegial display in the Oval Office. Elon Musk attacked Trump in posts on X on Thursday (Friday AEST). Credit: NurPhoto via Getty Images Musk, who had largely focused his attacks on Republicans in Congress, had started directing more ire at the president. So when Trump was asked about Musk\u2019s comments during a meeting with Friedrich Merz, the new German chancellor, the president finally let loose. He said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in Musk, downplayed the billionaire\u2019s financial support for his presidential campaign and posited that Musk developed \u201cTrump derangement syndrome\u201d after leaving the White House. Musk fired back in real time. Using X, he unleashed a torrent of attacks. He claimed there were references to the president in government documents about Jeffrey Epstein, the sex offender, and indicated his support for the president\u2019s impeachment. He also said Trump\u2019s tariffs would cause a recession by the end of the year.\n\nLoading Later, Trump, using his own social media platform, threatened to cut billions of dollars in federal contracts with Musk\u2019s companies. By Thursday evening, Musk signalled he would be open to de-escalating the fight, while the president seemed to have little interest in an immediate reconciliation. White House officials said Trump had no plans to call Musk. \u201cPresident Trump is the unequivocal leader of the Republican Party, and the vast majority of the country approves of his job performance as president,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. \u201cInflation is down, consumer confidence and wages are up, the jobs report beat expectations for the third month in a row, the border is secure and America is hotter than ever before.\u201d A spokesperson for Musk did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLoading Musk, his allies and even some White House officials now pin the blame on Gor, believing he sabotaged Isaacman as Musk was on his way out. But some close Trump allies say Gor was being unfairly criticised for a decision that ultimately rests with the president. Gor and Musk clashed several times early in Trump\u2019s second term, including at two cabinet meetings, when Musk questioned how swiftly Gor was moving to fill the top ranks of agencies. Musk\u2019s team and Gor\u2019s team often disagreed over personnel and the amount of power that should be given to aides at DOGE. But Gor\u2019s title \u2013 director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office \u2013 does not convey the scope of his influence in the president\u2019s orbit. Gor founded a pro-Trump super political action committee during the 2024 presidential election, and co-founded a publishing house with Donald Trump Jr that has published books by the president and his allies. The president\u2019s aides and allies quickly jumped to Gor\u2019s defence on Friday.",

        "text": "If that was so crucial, how to explain the cards that Postecoglou was asked to play? Why was he given such a thin squad to take into the season, its lack of depth brutally exposed by those injuries? Why was it that Spurs did not support him with another centre-back in the January transfer window until after their third-choice option in that position went down with a season-ending ACL injury, adding to a crisis which had already ripped the heart out of their domestic campaign? Why was their policy of pursuing talented young players \u2013 which, no doubt, will hold them in good stead for the coming years \u2013 not also supported with experience that could have enabled them to compete on multiple fronts, when they absolutely have the financial capacity to do both? Postecoglou knew it wasn\u2019t possible this season, so after January, as he explained in his post-Europa League final press conference, he selected one front and focused on it. His staff and playing group backed him in. He made the calculation that ending the club\u2019s trophy drought was the only way of breaking their psychological chains. He said that not everybody at the club agreed with that decision; we can now safely assume that Levy was one of those people. Levy now has the nerve to talk about \u201cemotions\u201d when there was clear logic at play. Tottenham\u2019s motto is Audere est Facere: To Dare is To Do. Postecoglou dared, and he did. \u201cThe game is about glory,\u201d the legendary Spurs manager Danny Blanchflower once said. He brought them glory, and his reward was the sack. Postecoglou and Spurs chairman Daniel Levy after the Europa League win. Credit: Getty Images\n\nHe deserved the right to have another crack, but that has been taken away from him. This is the first time Postecoglou has been fired mid-contract. Sure, he was let go by Football Federation Australia at the end of his six-year tenure as Australia\u2019s national youth coach, but that was a little different \u2013 his contract was up, and he probably wasn\u2019t going to seek an extension anyway. He has always tried to be the master of his own destiny, but not this time. He will land on his feet. Tottenham\u2019s loss will be another club\u2019s gain. Postecoglou\u2019s reputation has only been enhanced by his time there, his triumph in the Europa League and the way he handled himself throughout. Another team will come for him, and he will win with them. Inter Milan, the beaten UEFA Champions League finalists, could do much worse after their manager Simone Inzaghi decided to take the riches in Saudi Arabia. So could other clubs in Italy, Germany, Spain ... anywhere, really, where they like success. Equally, Postecoglou will feel he has unfinished business in England, and will want to defy the critics who say his brand of football is unsustainable in the Premier League.\n\nAs for Spurs? The hot favourite to take over is Thomas Frank, the Danish manager currently in charge of Brentford. He may prove an excellent fit. Postecoglou has left him an excellent platform to build upon. Loading But Frank has also never won a major trophy in his career. He has never managed a club which has competed in European competitions, or one as big as Tottenham Hotspur. Last season, his team finished 10th in the Premier League, largely due to injuries. He will also have to deal with a playing group that was utterly in Postecoglou\u2019s thrall and reportedly angry with how the club handled his exit. And a board which has made it clear that winning trophies is not enough for them. Tasking him with untying the Gordian knot that is Tottenham Hotspur is a bigger risk than sticking with Postecoglou for a little longer \u2013 but that is their call. Good luck with that.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Seated in the austere confines of the Independent Commission Against Corruption\u2019s witness box, Mark Scott, the former secretary of the NSW Education Department, remembered Anthony Manning as a popular choice as the first chief executive of a new school-building unit back in 2017. Well-connected from his time working for the equivalent health agency, Manning\u2019s name had been floated as a possible candidate by then-education minister Rob Stokes after a suggestion from PwC partner Amy Brown, and the former premier Mike Baird was among his referees. Health minister Brad Hazzard complimented the appointment at the time, Scott recalled, and senior public servants who had worked with Manning gave Scott the impression of someone viewed as \u201ccan-do\u201d and \u201cfocused\u201d. \u201cI received no signals of concern or disquiet,\u201d Scott recalled. There were no \u201cred flags\u201d. Former NSW Education Department secretary Mark Scott leaving the ICAC building.

It is also probing whether Manning and others engaged in \u201creprisal action\u201d against staff who raised concerns. The probe came after Manning\u2019s abrupt departure from the role in February last year. The Sydney Morning Herald first reported his referral to the watchdog in July, as well as concerns over an axed $40 million school building contract awarded by the agency. That Manning was in the ICAC\u2019s sights had been a discomforting discovery for successive education secretaries. Georgina Harrisson, who headed the department from 2021 to 2023, said she became \u201cless assertive\u201d in her attempts to track contractor spending in the agency after being notified of \u201ca need not to disrupt things\u201d because of the probe.

All four were handed millions of dollars in contracts from the agency during Manning\u2019s time as chief executive via their companies, and all four had personal and professional relationships with him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManning had known Berry since 2006 and organised his buck\u2019s party. He took spin and yoga classes with Suthern-Brunt, and once described Jones as his \u201ccommunications fairy godmother\u201d. In 2017, he and Palassis were part of a group trying to develop a \u201ccancer wellness\u201d hospital in China close to the time his company, Paxon, were bidding along with PwC to win a tender with the agency. In total, the four contractors and their associated companies earned some $18 million from NSW taxpayers during Manning\u2019s time in School Infrastructure. But the inquiry has also laid bare a culture in which contingent workers on astronomical wages rode roughshod over the established bureaucracy \u2013 some 1,400 contractors were paid more than $344 million between 2017 and 2024, a figure which does not include the sums paid to Manning\u2019s associates \u2013 and where officials who raised concerns about breaches of procurement rules were often swept aside. Andrea Patrick appears as a witness at the ICAC. Credit: ICAC It was an agency in which, at least according to some witnesses, the normal rules did not apply. Andrea Patrick, a senior procurement officer at the department who was fired by Manning, alleged that at a meeting in 2017 he \u201cmade a comment along the lines of \u2018I don\u2019t need you or services or policies\u2019.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManning, she claimed, told her he had a \u201cdirect line\u201d to ministers and said words to the effect of \u201cif I need to do things different, I just pick up the phone to them, and they\u2019ll sort it\u201d. Running through the inquiry is a sense Manning believed he was brought in to the building unit to shake up a flailing department. Loading With a $2.6 billion funding injection for new school infrastructure coming, there was concern at senior levels of the NSW government that that current leadership wouldn\u2019t be able to get the job done, Scott recalled. Stokes, who was education minister when the agency was set up but is not accused of any wrongdoing, described a feeling of \u201cexasperation\u201d with the department over issues such as a new high-rise school, Arthur Phillip in Parramatta, which was plagued by cost blow-outs and delays. The agency was established in 2017 as the state\u2019s public schools were facing an explosion in enrolments and overcrowding was hitting primary and high schools. At the time Stokes described the new unit as \u201ca centre of excellence for assets and their delivery\u201d in response to \u201cchanges around population growth, new ways of teaching and learning, and social change\u201d. But from very early in his tenure, the behaviour which ICAC is now probing began to emerge. Only six weeks into the job, ICAC has heard, Manning spoke to his former boss and friend, Martin Berry, about engaging him and his company, Heathwest Advisory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nManning and Berry had known each other since about 2006, ICAC has heard, and in his first round of evidence to the commission last week, Berry conceded the two were friends. He gave Manning a job in the Sydney office of consulting firm Turner & Townsend and the two men often socialised together. Manning organised Berry\u2019s buck\u2019s party and attended his wedding, and in text messages dating back to 2015 they bantered about England\u2019s success in the cricket \u2013 both are from that country \u2013 and arranged to catch up for dinner and drinks near their homes on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches. They also discussed work, and Berry admitted Manning had helped get him a job at Health Infrastructure NSW. But, he also said the men \u201ckept our relationship at a professional level\u201d. \u201cSorry, just, what do you mean by that?\u201d counsel assisting the inquiry Jamie Darams asked during the examination. \u201cWell, we recognised that there would be occasions where we might be in roles that would need to be seen to be maintaining a professional relationship,\u201d Berry responded. Two weeks after their meeting in 2017, ICAC has heard, Berry sent Manning a \u201cproposed scope of works\u201d to his private email address. The schools\u2019 boss then passed on Berry\u2019s wording to several of his staff \u2013 without telling them where it had come from \u2013 and a similar document was issued as a \u201crequest for quotations\u201d from the agency which Heathwest Advisory went on to win. In other words, as Darams put it, Berry drafted the scope of work put out to a tender that his own company was then awarded, giving it an \u201cobvious advantage\u201d over its competitors.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size In the middle of practically nowhere - six hours\u2019 drive west of Sydney, five hours\u2019 drive north of Melbourne - lies the best-kept secret in Australian soccer. Maybe Australian sport. Griffith, NSW, is a place that shouldn\u2019t exist. Without irrigation, it would be a desert - dry, flat, and empty. But in 1916, as part of the bold, utopian Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area scheme, it was built from scratch as a planned city, designed by Walter Burley Griffin, the same American architect who laid out Canberra. The early settlers, mostly returned servicemen and British migrants, struggled with the land; it wasn\u2019t until the Italians arrived, bringing with them generations of agricultural know-how and a relentless work ethic, that the region truly began to bloom. Today, around 60 per cent of the city\u2019s 25,000 residents are said to claim some degree of Italian heritage, and it shines through in everything they do. Top-notch Italian eateries line the city\u2019s main drag, Banna Avenue; walking into the famous old La Scala restaurant, down a dingy, dimly lit staircase, was like stumbling into a dinner scene from Goodfellas. The local wine scene is quietly excellent; Yellow Tail, Australia\u2019s leading export brand and a bona fide global phenomenon, is produced in Yenda, which is a 13-minute drive to the east.

And then, of course, there\u2019s the soccer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe standard of play at Griffith\u2019s grassroots is surprisingly high given its geographic isolation. The passion for the game is strong, and it has to be, considering the immense obstacles that need to be overcome just to take part. To play at any serious level is to accept many, many hours of driving for hundreds of kilometres just to find an opponent. In football, as in agriculture, Griffith\u2019s best produce ends up elsewhere. If you happen to be decent - like Brisbane Roar youngster Pearson Kasawaya, or former national league players such as Michael Musitano, Eliza Ammendolia or Jordan Jasnos - you eventually have to move to the big smoke to pursue your dreams. \u2018A big family affair\u2019 Griffith\u2019s biggest and most successful club is Yoogali Soccer Club, named for the small township on the city\u2019s eastern fringes, towards Yenda. It was formed in 1954 out of the Yoogali Club, one of Australia\u2019s oldest ethnic social clubs, which was where members of Sydney\u2019s Italian community visited for inspiration before founding Club Marconi - though it no longer plays there, having linked up with the Griffith Leagues Club down the road years ago. (That\u2019s why there\u2019s a second team based in Yoogali, known as Yoogali Football Club; the schism between \u2018YSC\u2019 and \u2018YFC\u2019 would require a whole book to properly explain.) Yoogali has won 34 first-grade titles in various competitions and regularly hosts teams from Sydney for pre-season matches. Tom Sermanni used to bring the Matildas there regularly for training camps during his first two stints as national team boss and spoke at Yoogali\u2019s season launch at the start of this year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Yoogali Club.

Luke Santolin is the current coach of Yoogali\u2019s senior men\u2019s team. His grandfather (or nonno) No\u00e9 was one of the club\u2019s founding fathers - the field at the Yoogali Club is named for him - and his father Tony used to coach, and still plays. \u201cThey used to play after church with all the Italian immigrants, and it just grew from there,\u201d Santolin says. \u201cLike most football club stories, they were doing everything: they were cutting the grass, they were painting the lines, putting the nets up, all that jazz. It was a big family affair back then. My two boys have just started playing now. It\u2019s really all I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d One of Yoogali\u2019s earliest soccer teams, from the 1950s. Credit: Yoogali SC Yoogali has an itinerant soccer history, through no fault of their own. Far too big for the local league in Griffith, they have spent decades trying to find somewhere to play, only to be consistently rebuffed. They\u2019ve played in Shepparton (twice), Wagga Wagga, a short-lived Regional Premier League involving other Victorian teams, and most notably, in Canberra.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvariably, other teams get sick of driving to Griffith and find a way to get rid of them, even though they only have to travel once per year, and Yoogali every fortnight. \u201cWe\u2019ve never forfeited a game. Would you believe that? Never,\u201d says Santolin. Griffith\u2019s greatest soccer triumph came in 1971, when a team called Griffith United (an amalgamation of Yoogali and Hanwood FC, their fierce rivals) won the league and cup double in the ACT. They played in front of big, boisterous crowds at home, and then jumped on a bus to Canberra every other weekend to fulfil their away commitments. In that team? Not only Tony Santolin and two Paraguayan brothers, Willie and George Wood, but a 16-year-old Walter Valeri, the father of future Socceroo Carl; his father (Carl\u2019s nonno) was one of Hanwood\u2019s founding members. The Valeris later moved to Canberra for work opportunities. Former Socceroo Carl Valeri (centre) can trace his roots back to Griffith - specifically, to Hanwood FC. Credit: Reuters \u201cThe impossible dream came true,\u201d wrote local newspaper The Area News when Griffith United were crowned champions. \u201cThey trained hard, travelled long distance and fought tenaciously to give this town an enviable soccer supremacy. They won and thoroughly deserved it.\u201d The next year, they were kicked out for administrative reasons. For the past five years, Yoogali has been competing in Canberra again, as part of the Capital Football system. In 2023, they won promotion to the top-flight NPL - putting them technically just one step below the A-League - and then last year, defied the odds to stay up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnlike their opponents, they don\u2019t pay their players - although they do have a long, proud history of sourcing players from overseas, particularly from Scotland. They don\u2019t get paid either, but the club does cover their airfares and finds them work in Griffith (picking fruit, usually, at first) and a place to live. Some of them never go back. \u201cI remember as a kid growing up, my grandparents had a granny flat at the back of their house where the overseas players would live in,\u201d Santolin says. \u201cI remember going to kick the ball with them and then seeing them play for Yoogali on a Sunday. We got to a level where players were calling us, saying they\u2019d heard from a mutual friend or a contact about our club, and how do they come out? You only get that reputation by conducting yourselves the right way. Some of my best friends ever started off as visa players, and now they\u2019ve got three, four kids, a wife, a business, when originally they just came over to kick a ball. So it\u2019s pretty special.\u201d This year\u2019s team features five members of the Donadel family who, like the Santolins, are Yoogali royalty. Two of them are sons of Sante Donadel, assistant coach, former first-grade coach and a former player for over 50 years. The Donadels moved to Griffith in 1970; Sante\u2019s father played for Yoogali, and made life-long friends at the club, and his uncle was coach of Griffith United when they did the double in \u201971. \u201cWe\u2019re still learning, as players, coaches and our committee, how to deal with that level of football, the NPL,\u201d Donadel says. \u201cIt\u2019s by far the best comp we\u2019ve played in. But it\u2019s been good. We\u2019re one of the only [regional] clubs to have ever done something like this.\u201d Things have been tracking well on the field. They recently smashed last season\u2019s premiers, Gungahlin United, 5-1.\n\nAdvertisement",

Source: TikTok/Itsrubytravels\n\nStringent immigration checks and cases of travellers being turned away at the border have left many Aussies second-guessing their need to travel to the United States in recent months.\n\nAnd one traveller heading to America was recently left with a sinking feeling when she received her boarding pass at Brisbane Airport with the code SSSS printed on it.\n\nThe code, which stands for \"secondary security screening selection\", is the \"four letters no traveller wants to see on their boarding pass\" when travelling to the United States, according to United passenger Ruby.\n\nSharing her experience, Ruby said the code is known as \"every traveller's worst nightmare\" to those who regularly visit the US because those who receive it are subjected to additional security screening before they are allowed to board.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I've travelled to over 30 countries so am aware of the stigma around it,\" she told Yahoo News.\n\nAussie subject to additional security screening before US flight\n\nRuby told Yahoo that upon checking into their flight at Brisbane airport ahead of a three-week holiday, her fianc\u00e9 \u2013 who is a US citizen \u2013 had \"no problem\", but she was told she required additional checks.\n\n\"When I got to the bag drop and my boarding pass was printed, I got the dreaded four S's,\" she explained. \"They didn't check my paperwork or say anything, which was surprising.\"\n\nIt wasn't until she arrived at the gate and was ready to board that she was \"pulled aside\" to a table for the additional screening.\n\n\"After you've scanned your boarding pass, they said 'go over there' and they had me hand over my passport, which they reviewed. I put all of my stuff out on the table and they swabbed everything, including my bag, laptop, hands and stomach. I've never had that before,\" she explained.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRuby said that travellers can be flagged for \"all sorts of reasons\" with some saying it's \"random\". \"It's kind of a lottery for seasoned travellers,\" she said.\n\nLuckily, Ruby was allowed to proceed with her journey but it wasn't the end of her security woes. At immigration in San Francisco, she said, \"they were really grilling me\".\n\n\"You never know with the US,\" she warned.\n\nDespite that, she still urged Aussies to enjoy the country, adding that \"it's still safe\" and \"if you have nothing to hide, you shouldn't be worried\". \"Go have fun, but be careful and stay safe,\" she said.\n\nWhy does the SSSS security check exist?\n\nProminent immigration lawyer Melissa Vincenty told Yahoo News she has been subject to the screening herself and has even seen children get flagged.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"As soon as you see it you think 'oh man',\" she laughed. But added the additional security checks are common and nothing to worry about.\n\n\"This has been around since the 9/11 legislation when they made the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) under the Department of Homeland Security,\" she explained of the change made in 2003.\n\nWhile neither the TSA nor airlines publish the criteria used when boarding passes are issued, Vincenty believes that the selection process is random.\n\n\"They are required by law to randomly select passengers,\" she explained of the security screening.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
