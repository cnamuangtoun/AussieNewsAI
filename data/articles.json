        "text": "Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Michele Bullock has come out in support of US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell after US President Donald Trump ramped up his feud against the head of the fed.\n\nRBA head Bullock today joined with more than a dozen other central bankers in expressing their \"full solidarity\" with Powell after the US Department of Justice threatened him with a criminal indictment over his comments at a Senate Banking Committee meeting in June\ufeff last year.\n\n\"The independence of central banks is a cornerstone of price, financial and economic stability in the interest of the citizens that we serve,\" the bankers said.\n\nReserve Bank Governor Michele Bullock during a press conference at the Reserve Bank, after interest rates were left on hold. Tuesdsay, December 9. (Louie Douvis/AFR)\n\n\"It is therefore critical to preserve that independence, with full respect for the rule of law and democratic accountability.\n\n\"Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate and an unwavering commitment to the public interest.\n\n\"To us, he is a respected colleague who is held in the highest regard by all who have worked with him.\"\n\nTrump, who appointed Powell during his first term, has repeatedly battered the Fed chair since returning to the Oval Office, directly and publicly calling on him to cut interest rates, in a break with modern presidential practice.\n\nHe's called for Powell to be fired and replaced with someone more willing to drastically cut the US cash rate.\ufeff\n\nTrump dramatically escalated his pressure campaign this week, with his Justice Department investigating and threatening a criminal indictment of the independent central bank and serving it with subpoenas.\n\nTrump has repeatedly battered Powell in public since returning to the Oval Office. (AP)\n\nThe dispute is ostensibly about Powell's testimony to Congress in June over the cost of a massive renovation of Fed buildings.\n\nOn Sunday, Powell called the administration's threat of criminal charges \"pretexts'' in the president's campaign to seize control of US interest rate policy.\n\nEconomists warned if a politicised Fed caved in to Trump, it would damage its credibility.\n\nPolitically independent central banks can more easily take unpopular steps to fight inflation, such as rate hikes, which preserve price stability over the longer term.\n\nUS Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell announced the interest rate rise. (AP)\n\nOther signatories of the statement carried on the European Central Bank's website were European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde; Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey; Erik Thedeen, the governor of Sweden's central bank; Christian Kettel Thomsen, the chair of Denmark's central bank; and Swiss National Bank chair Martin Schlegel.\n\nThe Bank of Japan, a prominent central bank, was not included but the statement said more signatories could be added later.",

(Getty)\n\n\"We often think of workplace stress as one of the main drivers of excessive drinking, but our research shows that sociodemographic and health factors are even more important,\" Di Censo said.\n\n\"That said, certain work conditions do increase risk, and understanding these patterns is vital for designing effective ways in which to help those who are indulging in high-risk drinking.\"\n\nThe study analysed responses from over 26,000 employed Australians and found that working more than 40 hours a week was linked to higher odds of drinking at harmful levels across the week.\n\nLong hours and shift work were linked to heavy drinking. (Eamon Gallagher)\n\nShift workers were more likely to engage in one-off high-risk drinking occasions, while those who wanted to work more hours also showed elevated risk.\n\n\"We believe that wanting more work hours may reflect underlying factors such as financial stress, workaholism, or other traits that predispose individuals to high-risk drinking patterns, which is consistent with previous research,\" Di Censo said.\n\nJob satisfaction was not a major factor, which researchers suggested the interesting probability \ufeffthat structural factors mattered more than enjoying your work.\n\nREAD MORE: Tom Silvagni files appeal against rape convictions \ufeff\n\nBeyond workplace factors, the research revealed differences based on age, gender and lifestyle.\n\nYoung workers aged 18 to 29 were almost eight times more likely to binge drink compared to older colleagues, and men were far more likely than women to drink to excess.\n\nSmoking emerged as the strongest modifiable risk factor, with smokers nearly three times more likely to drink at high-risk levels.\n\n\"This tells us that prevention and intervention programs shouldn't just focus on alcohol in isolation,\" Di Censo said.\n\n\"Programs that address multiple health behaviours, like smoking and drinking together, are likely to be more effective.\"\n\nCo-author Dr Kirrilly Thompson from the College of Medicine and Public Health and NCETA says the findings have clear implications for employers.\n\n\"Workplaces can't ignore this issue. Long hours and shift work are linked to harmful drinking patterns, and myths like 'alcohol helps you sleep' persist among shift workers,\" she said.\n\n\"Employers need to provide education about the real effects of alcohol, promote work-life balance and offer support for stress management. These steps can make a real difference.\"\n\nDi Censo said tailored approaches were key.\n\n\"Younger male workers and those in physically demanding jobs like labouring are among the highest-risk groups. Targeting these populations with relevant messaging and support could make a real difference,\" he said.\n\n\"By recognising how work conditions intersect with drinking habits, employers and policymakers can help create healthier environments for everyone.\"\n\nThe study, published in Drug and Alcohol Review , can be found online here .\ufeff",

        "text": "Scott Adams, whose popular comic strip Dilbert captured the frustration of beleaguered, white-collar cubicle workers and satirised the ridiculousness of modern office culture until he was dropped from syndication in 2023 for racist remarks, has died. He was 68.\n\nHis first ex-wife, Shelly Miles, announced his death in a livestream posted on Adams's social media accounts.\n\nMs Miles had said he was in hospice care in his Northern California home on Monday.\n\nAdams revealed in 2025 that he had prostate cancer that had spread to his bones.\n\n\"I had an amazing life,\" the statement said. \"I gave it everything I had.\"\n\nEponymous employee\n\nAt its height, Dilbert, with its mouthless, bespectacled hero in a white short-sleeved shirt and a perpetually curled red tie, appeared in 2,000 newspapers in at least 70 countries and 25 languages.\n\nAdams was the 1997 recipient of the National Cartoonist Society's Reuben Award, considered one of the most prestigious awards in the US for cartoonists.\n\n'Own goal': One Nation mocks Robert Irwin's legal threat to sue over cartoon One Nation published a two-minute video on Friday which used Robert Irwin and popular children's character Bluey to mock the state government over perceived failings ahead of the election in October.\n\nThat same year, Dilbert became the first fictional character to make Time magazine's list of the most influential Americans.\n\n\"We are rooting for him because he is our mouthpiece for the lessons we have accumulated \u2014 but are too afraid to express \u2014 in our effort to avoid cubicular homicide,\" the magazine said.\n\nDilbert strips were routinely photocopied, pinned up, emailed and posted online, a popularity that would spawn bestselling books, merchandise, commercials for Office Depot and an animated TV series with Daniel Stern voicing Dilbert.\n\nRacist comments\n\nIt all collapsed quickly in 2023 when Adams, who was white, repeatedly referred to black people as members of a \"hate group\" and said he would no longer \"help black Americans\".\n\nHe later said he was being hyperbolic, yet continued to defend his stance.\n\nAlmost immediately, newspapers dropped Dilbert and the distributor, Andrews McMeel Universal, severed ties with the cartoonist.\n\nThe Sun Chronicle in Attleboro, Massachusetts, decided to keep the Dilbert space blank for a while \"as a reminder of the racism that pervades our society\".\n\nDilbert dumped after creator's racist remarks The creator of the Dilbert comic strip faced a backlash of cancellations Saturday while defending remarks describing people who are Black as members of \"a hate group\" from which white people should \"get away.\"\n\nA planned book was scrapped.\n\nAdams relaunched the same daily comic strip under the name Dilbert Reborn via the video platform Rumble, popular with conservatives and far-right groups.\n\nHe also hosted a podcast, Real Coffee, in which he talked about political and social issues.\n\nAfter Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show on US TV was suspended in September in the wake of the host's comments on reactions to the murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk, Adams said he stood for free speech.\n\n\"Would I like some revenge?\" he said.\n\n\"Yes. Yes, I would enjoy that. But that doesn't mean I get it. That doesn't mean I should pursue it. Doesn't mean the world's a better place if it happens.\"\n\nFrom office worker to cartoonist\n\nAdams was working in a corporate job at the Pacific Bell telephone company in the 1980s, sharing his cartoons to amuse co-workers.\n\nHe drew Dilbert as a computer programmer and engineer for a high-tech company and mailed a batch to cartoon syndicators.\n\n\"The take on office life was new and on target and insightful,\" Sarah Gillespie, who helped discover Dilbert in the 1980s at United Media, told The Washington Post.\n\n\"I looked first for humour and only secondarily for art, which with Dilbert was a good thing, as the art is universally acknowledged to be \u2026 not great.\"\n\nWashington Post cartoonist resigns over rejected cartoon featuring owner Jeff Bezos Ann Telnaes says her editor prevented her from holding power to account by refusing to publish a cartoon showing tech giants bowing to the US president-elect.\n\nThe first Dilbert comic strip officially appeared on April 16, 1989, long before workplace sitcoms like The Office.\n\nIt portrayed corporate culture as a Severance-like, Kafkaesque world of heavy bureaucracy and pointless benchmarks, where employee effort and skill were under-appreciated.\n\nThe strip introduced the Dilbert Principle: The most ineffective workers will be systematically moved to the place where they can do the least damage \u2014 management.\n\n\"Throughout history, there have always been times when it's very clear that the managers have all the power and the workers have none,\" Adams told Time magazine.\n\n\"Through Dilbert, I would think the balance of power has slightly changed.\"\n\nOther strip characters included Dilbert's pointy-haired boss; Asok, a young, naive intern; Wally, a middle-aged slacker; and Alice, a worker so frustrated that she was prone to frequent outbursts of rage, and Dilbert's pet, Dogbert, a megalomaniac.\n\nAnger and aphorisms\n\n\"There's a certain amount of anger you need to draw Dilbert comics,\" Adams told the Contra Costa Times in 2009.\n\nIn 1993, Adams became the first syndicated cartoonist to include his email address in his strip. That triggered a dialogue between the artist and his fans, giving Adams a fountain of ideas for the strip.\n\nDilbert was also known for generating aphorisms, like \"All rumours are true \u2014 especially if your boss denies them\" and \"OK, let's get this preliminary pre-meeting going\".\n\n\"If you can come to peace with the fact that you're surrounded by idiots, you'll realise that resistance is futile, your tension will dissipate, and you can sit back and have a good laugh at the expense of others,\" Adams wrote in his 1996 book The Dilbert Principle.\n\nIn one real-life case, an Iowa worker was fired from the Catfish Bend Casino in 2007 for posting a Dilbert comic strip on the office bulletin board.\n\nIn the strip, Adams wrote: \"Why does it seem as if most of the decisions in my workplace are made by drunken lemurs?\"\n\nA judge later sided with the worker; Adams helped find him a new job.\n\nDonald Trump has paid tribute to Scott Adams. (Truth Social: Donald Trump)\n\nDescent into misogyny and racism\n\nWhile Adams' career fall seemed swift, careful readers of Dilbert saw a gradual darkening of the strip's tone and its creator's descent into misogyny, anti-immigration and racism.\n\nHe attracted attention for controversial comments, including saying in 2011 that women were treated differently by society for the same reason as children and the mentally disabled \u2014 \"it's just easier this way for everyone\".\n\nIn a blog post from 2006, he questioned the death toll of the Holocaust.\n\nIn June 2020, Adams tweeted that when the Dilbert TV show ended in 2000 after just two seasons, it was \"the third job I lost for being white\". But, at the time, he blamed it on lower viewership and time slot changes.\n\nAdams' beliefs began bleeding into his strips.\n\nRemembering the celebrities and public figures who died in 2025 From actors and designers to a Holocaust survivor and a broadcaster, these men and women made their mark.\n\nIn one in 2022, a boss says that traditional performance reviews would be replaced by a \"wokeness\" score. When an employee complained that could be subjective, the boss said, \"That'll cost you two points off your wokeness score, bigot.\"\n\nAdams put a brave face on his fall from grace, tweeting in 2023: \"Only the dying leftist Fake News industry cancelled me (for out-of-context news of course). Social media and banking unaffected. Personal life improved. Never been more popular in my life. Zero pushback in person. Black and White conservatives solidly supporting me.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, President Donald Trump remembered Adams as a \"Great Influencer\".\n\n\"He was a fantastic guy, who liked and respected me when it wasn't fashionable to do so. He bravely fought a long battle against a terrible disease,\" the president posted on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\nAP",

Then we noticed that there was a switch, and people would come in and see the security cameras, and they wouldn't dump things as well.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said this Christmas marked the first time they had come back from holidays to find no dumped donations at the back door.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr Jadi said if people were going to donate, they should follow one simple rule.\n\n\"If you would give it to a mate, then it's OK to donate to us.\"",

        "text": "If you're feeling concerned about microplastics, it can be hard to know what to do about them. After all, aren't they everywhere?\n\n\"We are constantly exposed to microplastics and nanoplastics, even smaller particles,\" Cassandra Rauert says.\n\n\"We really don't have a good understanding of any links to potential health outcomes,\" the senior research fellow at The University of Queensland says.\n\nEnvironmental researcher and research fellow at The University of Queensland, Elvis Okoffo, says microplastics and nanoplastics are a \"very new area\" and a lot of research is being undertaken to understand how they behave in our bodies.\n\nBut, if you want to reduce your exposure as a precautionary measure, researchers say there are simple ways to do this at home.\n\nChopping boards, cooking utensils and water bottles\n\nEnvironmental chemist and Macquarie University Research fellow Yunlong Luo says if you're applying heat, heavy friction or strong chemicals to plastic, \"there's a good chance it's breaking down and releasing particles\".\n\nWith this in mind, Dr Luo says it might make sense to swap items that get this kind of use for alternative materials, for example, plastic cutting boards for wooden ones.\n\nNew research points to need for microplastic filters in dishwashers New research has found cleaning plastic containers in the dishwasher is actually a source of microplastic pollution.\n\nDr Rauert says she uses wooden chopping boards and cooking utensils instead of plastic as it's an \"easy swap\" to make.\n\nDr Okoffo also suggests trading plastic chopping boards for alternatives, such as silicone or wood.\n\nWhere possible, he recommends choosing different materials such as metal water bottles, wooden utensils and glass containers.\n\nIf you do have plastic water bottles, avoid leaving them in a hot car or direct sunlight, Dr Okoffo says.\n\nPlastic containers\n\nDr Okoffo avoids microwaving plastics whenever possible, \"especially if they're reused, old, or scratched\".\n\nThis is because \"temperature actually plays a major role\" in the release of microplastics and chemicals.\n\nInstead, he says to move leftovers into ceramic or glass before microwaving or consider trading your plastic containers for glass or ceramic options.\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nDr Rauert says she minimises the amount of plastic food containers she uses, and doesn't put plastic in the microwave.\n\n\"Cheaper plastic containers do shed a lot of plastic, and it's worse when you put hot food in them.\"\n\nBecause of this, Dr Okoffo recommends waiting for food to cool down before putting it in a plastic container.\n\nHe also suggests handwashing plastics, because conditions in the dishwasher \u2014 the high temperature and detergent \u2014 aid the release of plastic particles from containers.\n\nHandwashing plastic containers still releases particles, he notes, so it's a case of reduction rather than removal.\n\nChemicals in plastic containers can also potentially leak or migrate into food, \"especially when containers are used in ways they're not supposed to be\", Dr Okoffo says.\n\nRecent research shows washing plastic containers in dishwashers at high temperatures causes those items to shed micro and nano-sized plastic particles. (Supplied: Adobe Stock)\n\nThe kettle\n\nOne of the authors of a recent study into the release of microplastics and nanoplastics from plastic kettles, Dr Okoffo, says these appliances are another source of exposure for many of us.\n\nThe highest levels of plastics were detected in water after the first few boils of a new plastic kettle, but research found that \"the plastic concentration reduced drastically\" from 50 to 150 boils, he says.\n\nOne of the study's recommendations is for manufacturers to let consumers know to boil the kettle and discard the contents before using it, rather than simply rinsing it.\n\nDr Okoffo says cost is undeniably a factor and \"people will still definitely go for the plastic kettle\", but the research did lead him to upgrade from a plastic kettle to a more expensive stainless steel option at home.\n\nThe clothes dryer\n\n\"One of the major sources of plastics into the environment is from synthetic clothing,\" Dr Okoffo says.\n\nLaundry is a top source of microplastic pollution Clothes shed microfibres while they are manufactured, worn and disposed of, but especially when they are washed. A single wash load can release several million microfibres \u2014 but you can decrease this by changing your technique.\n\nDr Luo says clothes dryers can be a \"significant source\" of microfibres at home and \"air drying clothes is a great way to cut down on this\".\n\nDr Rauert agrees and says there are also vented clothes dryers (that expel humid air outside the house using a vent), which will mean more particles will go outside.\n\nShe also looks for natural fibres over synthetics, where possible, when shopping for new clothes.\n\nDusting and mopping\n\nCleaning can also help reduce microplastics, according to Dr Rauert and Dr Luo, as well as some of the chemicals used to make plastics, which can also \"settle into the dust\".\n\nDr Luo says using a damp cloth to wipe surfaces and vacuuming and mopping floors is likely to help minimise the tiny particles in the dust at home.",

He crashed on the first lap in the rain-hit season-opening Australian GP at Melbourne and in Miami, his last GP for Alpine.\n\nThe Queenslander was still under contract but the team said it reached a \"mutual agreement\" that releases him for the 2026 season onwards.\n\nAlpine finished last among the 10 teams in the F1 constructors' standings, with the switch to Colapinto not a clear success.\n\nThe Argentine did not crash in the 17 grands prix he started but nor did he gain a point, with his best finish being 11th.\n\nHowever, he did outperform teammate Pierre Gasly, who scored all Alpine's 22 points, six times.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nDoohan failed to beat the Frenchman and lapped slower by approximately 0.17 to 0.50 seconds in the three races where neither driver retired.\n\nOn his demotion, Alpine said Doohan was \"still an integral part of the team\" and he continued to work with them \u200bas \u200ba test \u200bdriver and a reserve.\n\nDoohan said at the time: \"I am very proud to have achieved my lifelong ambition to be a professional Formula One driver and I will forever be grateful to the team for helping me achieve this dream.\n\n\"Obviously, this latest chapter is a tough one to take because, as a professional driver, I want to be racing.\"\n\nThe desire to be racing, rather than testing, may well be behind his departure.\n\nAt 22, Doohan is young enough to have plenty of other opportunities in motor racing, though maybe not immediately in F1.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

So yes, we did see fires spread very rapidly along road sides, but I would expect that under those conditions, just like it did in bushland and across paddocks and the likes.\u201d Victoria endured temperatures above 40 degrees last week. CFA Volunteer Group vice president Brad Marson, captain of the Grassdale brigade who fought the Natimuk fire, said the longer grass was hazardous. The volunteer group was established last year to raise the plight of CFA volunteers. The CFA is investigating how last week\u2019s Longwood bushfire started. Credit: Jason South He said fires could spark from roads, such as through popped tyres, even when the verge was freshly mowed.\n\n\u201cIt just takes away a bit of risk,\u201d Marson said. He said it was more difficult to get on top of such a fire if the grass was longer, and described the Hume verge as being poorly maintained with too much fuel. Loading \u201cThat\u2019s hazardous, without a shadow of a doubt.\u201d Roadside fire management guidelines from the CFA said strategies to limit this risk could include pull-over lanes or shoulders to separate sparks on the road from grass.\n\nWhere there is a slashed verge next to the road shoulder, the guidelines said grass should be maintained at 10 centimetres during the fire danger period. This is limited by weather conditions, the document noted, given grass slashing creates possible sparks, and regrowth reduces its effectiveness over time. While fire spreads about as quickly in slashed grass as standing grass, the flame height is approximately halved. This makes suppression more achievable if responded to quickly, the document states. \u201cWhen fire danger is high, regardless of fuel management, a fire is likely to leave the reserve in a matter of minutes,\u201d it acknowledged.\n\nPremier Jacinta Allan\u2019s media event in Alexandra on Tuesday was disrupted by angry members of the public. Allan was heckled by a woman who claimed the CFA was underfunded. \u201cShame on you, shame on your government for what you\u2019ve done,\u201d the woman said, according to Nine News. Nine News reported a group of locals tried to corner the premier\u2019s car at the press conference, but they appeared to have the wrong vehicle. Arson investigators outside Longwood, near where the fire started.

The body of Maxwell Hobson was found 100 metres from a burnt-out vehicle that had run off the road in Gobur, between Yarck and Merton, on Sunday. The coroner is investigating his death. In 2013, the government created a map and risk assessment document that examined the bushfire danger across Victoria\u2019s arterial road network to reduce vegetation in areas of the greatest need. Thick smoke blanketed Yea on Friday as the fire raged out of control. Credit: Eddie Jim That document is now receiving its first significant update, with tenders released in July 2025, to develop a new assessment that is likely to take three years.\n\nThe tender documents note that existing analysis of the roadside fire risk is now 12 years old and does not contemplate newer parts of the road network, changes to the environment and the effect of disasters like the 2019-20 bushfires and 2022 floods. Back in 2018, the CFA aired concerns about 2000 kilometres worth of flexible wire rope barriers installed along country roads to prevent head-on and run-off-road crashes. The agency made clear it supported the barriers to save lives, but insisted vegetation would need to be maintained. Loading The CFA was raising its \u201cinterest in ensuring the management of fuel loads on road reserves\u201d, it said in a statement in 2018. Road barrier systems have breaks to allow for roadside maintenance.",

Her shots document that heady time and illustrate the changing social dynamics, capturing everyday moments like the above in communal houses, graffiti demanding childcare and social housing, protests about gay rights and women\u2019s liberation and a whole lot more. The images seem very uncurated, I say. \u201cWe were uncurated,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were all so incredibly happy with ourselves. We all thought we were so fabulous.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was punk, not in the sense of the Sex Pistols, but everybody was having a go at everything, trying out being a filmmaker or a writer or an artist or a photographer, in my case. With an overlay of social action and community giving and receiving.\u201d Places like the Pram Factory, La Mama and Circus Oz were in their infancy \u2013 the latter and its community remains a big part of her life; she was at a barbecue fundraiser for the rock\u2019n\u2019roll circus recently. \u201cI didn\u2019t ever do the trapeze but we all tried to learn to do things. The thing is, I had strength but no grace whatsoever,\u201d she says of its early days. Ponch Hawkes has been documenting our lives for five decades. Credit: Chris Hopkins One of the teachers was in traditional circus, which came with a particular type of training. \u201cYou\u2019re up hanging off a rope and she\u2019d happily let you wear the skin away, to see if you\u2019re tough enough, which I wasn\u2019t, really.\u201d Hawkes says it felt like the golden age: \u201cWhitlam was in, the economy was in good shape, there was full employment, rent was really cheap, interest rates were low-ish and so there was money for the arts.\u201d \u201dWe were turning people away \u2013 everything we did was completely sold out. I went on tour in a band with five other women, to schools and all sorts of incredible venues, doing a show about women\u2019s work, for which we had posters ... in different languages, so if we performed at a factory, people would know what we were doing... bold things like that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe contributed to Digger magazine, the short-lived but impactful counter-culture mag that focused on politics, sex, drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. Several of the images in the NGV show were first published in it, as was the essay that led to Helen Garner\u2019s sacking as a teacher, for speaking with her high school students about sex. We\u2019re dining at Hawkes\u2019 favourite local, Matsuya, a Japanese restaurant in Fairfield. It\u2019s quiet and comfortable and the staff welcome her warmly. She orders the vegetable tempura with a side of horenso (cold spinach with sesame dressing, much more delicious than it sounds), while I opt for the deluxe bento box; we share the gyoza to start, plus Japanese tea. Our photographer Chris Hopkins arrives and soon takes Hawkes outside to get a portrait shot, despite it being a wild and woolly day. \u201cI\u2019m ready for lunch, but am I ready for you?\u201d she quips as they head outside. Ponch Hawkes. Credit: Chris Hopkins When she gets back, I wonder if she took a peek at the pics? No. (Later, when she sees his fabulous shot with her hair seeming to stand on end, she\u2019s impressed and hopes we publish it.) Often, Hawkes interviews people before shooting them. Everybody\u2019s got a story, she says. \u201cYou get a sense of what that story might be. Also, if it\u2019s a portrait and they need to present really well, sometimes people are really direct and go, \u2018Oh no, I look terrible from that side\u2019 \u2013 especially actors. But most people are completely unaware of how they present, so they\u2019re really trusting you for a portrait.\u201d That degree of trust is a big part of what she does, perhaps best illustrated by her recent 500 Strong series, which features 500 women over the age of 50 photographed naked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome use props to cover their faces, many grin, smile or gaze happily into the camera; all show bodies of all shapes and sizes. It\u2019s an extraordinary body of work and continues to tour around the country. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of projects about good and worthy subjects, but this is the only one I\u2019ve ever done that\u2019s actually made real change,\u201d she says. \u201cHardly a day goes by that I don\u2019t run into someone, or someone writes me an email or a letter saying how differently they feel about things since they did the project or saw the project. It\u2019s really moving.\u201d Born and raised in Abbotsford, Hawkes had three siblings; her dad was a laundryman at Abbotsford Convent and her mum sometimes worked as a cook in pubs. Part of a panel of 500 Strong. Credit: Ponch Hawkes Her dad played in the reserves for Collingwood and later trained local footy clubs; his family all played local footy, \u201cthey were big, strapping men\u201d. Now a self-confessed diehard Collingwood fan, she didn\u2019t re-engage with footy until later in life. \u201cI can\u2019t remember what it was but I became fully engaged,\u201d she laughs, even writing a spirited defence of Mason Cox when he was attacked in an online supporters group. Her miniature poodle wears a Pies jumper in a pic on her phone and her membership for the next season has just arrived in the mail. Being a Collingwood supporter means you commune with fellow supporters, \u201cno matter where they come from \u2013 that\u2019s what tribes are about\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re both thrilled to see women playing Australian Rules, finally, even though the physicality of the game can mean it\u2019s sometimes hard to watch. \u201cBecause we\u2019re so unused to seeing girls tackle other girls or go in head-first or slam into people or do all the things we\u2019re used to in AFL. That\u2019s one of the reasons we love it so much, it\u2019s such a brutal bloody sport.\u201c Footy chat brings us to Helen Garner\u2019s wonderful book The Season, about her grandson and his local team. \u201cThat book made me feel glad to be alive and Helen\u2019s books aren\u2019t always like that... [it] was so full of joy. I just completely love her, she\u2019s such a brilliant writer.\u201d Helen and Gwen 1976, from the series Our mums and us by Ponch Hawkes. Credit: Ponch Hawkes/Museum of Australian Photography I find out over lunch that it\u2019s actually a young Garner in that photo described at the beginning of this piece. She also features in Hawke\u2019s series Our Mums and Us, which features mothers and their daughters photographed at their homes. It\u2019s a wonderful snapshot of time, borne out of the realisation \u201cthat your mother was not just your mother, she was a person in her own right\u201d. In 1976, it became her first exhibition. There are many similarities between their work: social realism and making art by documenting our lives, an incredible eye for detail, and a commitment to truth-telling.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "\u201cWhen he hits stronger than you, puts everything in the court, runs definitely not slower than you, [and] serves not worse than you, it\u2019s tough to beat him,\u201d Medvedev said.\n\nAlcaraz\u2019s peers are a little more circumspect in their praise, but former world No.1 Daniil Medvedev admitted last week, when asked about the current dominance of the pair, that the gap the top two ranked male players had opened up would be difficult to close.\n\n\u201cI have never seen tennis played like that \u2013 he is a virtuoso,\u201d McNamee said.\n\nAustralian tennis great Paul McNamee even goes as far as saying Alcaraz is the best all-round player the world has ever seen.\n\nOf course, in men\u2019s tennis, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are getting close.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nWho has the best forehand, backhand or serve on tour? Who excels at the net? Who handles the pressure best? Who returns serve the best? Does someone have a scary drop shot? Who is the fittest player on tour? And who can do the impossible if required?\n\nBy bringing together the biggest weapons of players competing in this year\u2019s Australian Open to create the complete tennis player, we reveal where the real on-court battles will be happening when the best meet the best in the next fortnight.\n\nAryna Sabalenka, the world No.1, has always had power. Now her touch game is improving and, although she may not be considered the best in the world at any specific shot, her all-round game makes her tough to beat.\n\nIn women\u2019s tennis, the gap between the top 10 players is tight, but there are still those with certain skills far beyond their peers\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise they are dominant in almost every category.\n\nWhy can some players serve better than others? Tennis Australia analyst Simon Rea says there are many variables, but one is essential: \u201cBeing biomechanically efficient on serve is a massive part of the equation.\u201d\n\nThe fact he is ranked outside the top 50 (he reached No.29 in February 2025) shows other parts of his game need improvement, but that serve\u2026 if you blink, you miss it. The USA\u2019s Ben Shelton and Italy\u2019s Matteo Berrettini also possess brutal serves, but Mpetshi Perricard has one of the fastest serves ever recorded.\n\nThe 22-year-old Frenchman\u2019s first serve would get a speeding fine on the Autobahn. He averages 215km/h as he rifles the ball at his opponent from a great height, given he stands 201 centimetres tall. He wins half his first-serve points without having to play another shot, given reading whether the ball is heading to the T, the body or out wide is so tough for his opponents.\n\nIf Nick Kyrgios was handed, and accepted, a wildcard to the Australian Open, he would have got the nod here as his peers rate him leagues ahead of the rest when it comes to serving. But he won\u2019t be playing singles at Melbourne Park, so Mpetshi Perricard gets the nod.\n\nWe crunched the numbers and canvassed expert views to build the best men\u2019s and women\u2019s player on tour and playing at this year\u2019s Australian Open.\n\nLook out if Alcaraz charges the net. Bulgaria\u2019s Grigor Dimitrov, France\u2019s Adrian Mannarino and America\u2019s Tommy Paul are also particularly dangerous at the net.\n\nHis athleticism and skill combines well with his aggressive attitude when it comes to volleying. He can defend, smother or attack, depending on his opponent\u2019s ability.\n\n\u201cYou have got to understand the magic of what he brings to the sport,\u201d McNamee said.\n\nBut McNamee said the category Alcaraz dominates is the all-round player category, with Novak Djokovic saying midway through 2023 that the young Spaniard had taken the best elements of him, Nadal and Roger Federer to develop the complete game.\n\n\u201cCarlos can hit a blinding forehand, then with the same grip in the next instant you will get an exquisite drop shot. No one has got the adaptability and versatility and control in all aspects of the game,\u201d McNamee said.\n\nHe said Rafael Nadal\u2019s forehand was better but Alcaraz\u2019s ability to switch gears is exhilarating.\n\n\u201cThe package is so extraordinary. [He has a] great forehand, excellent backhand, [and a] top serve,\u201d McNamee said.\n\nAlcaraz and Sinner have taken the forehand to a new level, but Alcaraz deserves the accolade. He has a classical forehand shape, which allows him creativity, flexibility and multiple options when choosing place, speed and spin.\n\nBest backhand: Jannik Sinner (Italy)\n\nThere was no argument here, as Sinner\u2019s backhand is unparalleled. Even Alcaraz has no doubt his rival has the edge; however, he did defend his own backhand in Seoul last Friday before an exhibition match against Sinner. \u201cI think my backhand is not that bad. I can use it even more than a forehand in a match.\u201d Alcaraz said.\n\nRea agrees that the difference between the two on the backhand is not as big as it may have once seemed. \u201cThe backhand-to-backhand battle from the back of the court might give the edge to Sinner, [however] Alcaraz has got the ability to have more variety from his backhand side and change gears a little bit,\u201d Rea said.\n\nWhat has impressed experts most about Sinner\u2019s ground strokes is his clean ball striking and consistency, which has been on display from the moment he began contending for grand slam titles in 2020. \u201cOn Sinner\u2019s forehand and backhand side, his speed has incrementally increased year-on-year. It\u2019s normally hard to increase speed and spin at the same time because there is a trade-off there\u2026 but he is doing both at the same time, which makes him impossibly heavy to handle at the other end,\u201d Rea said.\n\nMcNamee rated Djokovic as the man with the second-best backhand in world tennis, but Sinner\u2019s is numero uno. \u201cIt\u2019s pure,\u201d McNamee said. \u201cThe backhand is [Sinner\u2019s] best shot.\u201d\n\nBest drop shot: Carlos Alcaraz (Spain)\n\nFinesse is not normally the first word that comes to mind when Alcaraz is mentioned, but his drop shot is top-notch. He can deploy a slice backhand and has added the drop shot to his game to keep his opponents guessing and running.\n\nAlcaraz\u2019s ability to move around the court is unparallelled.\n\nBest return of serve: Jannik Sinner (Italy)\n\nSinner just gets the nod over Djokovic. Both return serve better than a comedian facing a heckler.\n\nAs for alternatives, Draper adds variety to the conversation. The tall left-handed Brit has a huge wingspan, which helps him reach good serves and punish any serves that sit up.\n\nMedvedev, who won the Brisbane International, is renowned for standing back and ensuring the return lands in play so his endurance and physicality can come to the fore.\n\nHandling pressure: Novak Djokovic (Serbia)\n\nThis is no knock on the top two, but Djokovic has handled the big moments for two decades now so he earns the right to be rated the best player in the tournament at handling pressure.\n\nNovak Djokovic, the master of handling pressure. Credit: AP\n\nFitness: Alex de Minaur (Australia)\n\nAgain, Alcaraz and Sinner have no overall peer, with Alcaraz being the best mover in the game, but for some local flavour and with some variation, we gave the gong to de Minaur. His pure speed from point A to point B is frightening, and Alcaraz tends to warm into his year, which is why we are yet to see him at his best in Melbourne in January.\n\nHaving said that, there has never been a better-prepared and fitter player than Djokovic, while Medvedev has made a living out of adopting a counter punching, marathon-running mentality.\n\nAlex De Minaur runs fast. Credit: Chris Hopkins\n\nAttempts the impossible: Lorenzo Sonego (Italy)\n\nHe might be ranked No.40 in the world, but this shot demonstrates better than any what the modern professional is capable of on-court.\n\nWomen\u2019s tennis\n\nBest serve: Elena Rybakina (Kazakhstan)\n\nAlthough it was off at times in Brisbane last week, Rybakina\u2019s serve is the best in women\u2019s tennis. She has great variety and generates speed, kicking and spitting the ball at the receiver.\n\nThe 26-year-old has also earned a reputation for delivering a brilliant serve right when she needs a free point most, with her numbers when down break point the best in the game.\n\nShe led the top 50 players in 2025 in first points winning percentage and percentage of service points won.\n\nBest volley: Belinda Bencic (Switzerland)\n\nBencic\u2019s net play is different to most of her peers, but it is brutally efficient.\n\n\u201cShe is trying to punish her ground strokes to the back of the court and then looking to pounce with the drive volley or a swinging volley. She comes forward a lot, and she operates well when she does.\u201d Rea said.\n\nBencic is skilful at taking the ball early, moving into play a half-volley on her way to the net, which puts her in a strong position compared to her opponent.\n\nMcNamee agrees Bencic has the best volley among those in the top 50, but said the player with the best volley in tennis is doubles star Hsieh Su-wei, who he coached with great success until the end of last year.\n\n\u201cThe problem with women\u2019s tennis is, because of their reach and their lack of agility compared to men, it is harder for them to get to the net so they don\u2019t get to use the volley often. It\u2019s not a shot you need that much in women\u2019s tennis,\u201d McNamee explained.\n\nBest forehand: Madison Keys (USA)\n\nThe reigning Australian Open champion has power to burn and has promised to come in behind her ground strokes to volley aggressively.\n\nShe has the forehand to make that happen if she can believe in her ability.\n\nHer average forehand speed in last year\u2019s Open was 130km/h, with her deep swing and fast feet combining with a big serve to win the championship.\n\nShe hit a remarkable 103 forehand winners in her first six matches in the Australian Open. Iga Swatiek has a reputation for a strong forehand, but opponents are no longer intimidated and some on the tour have even suggested players will attack that part of her game.\n\nBest backhand: Amanda Anisimova (USA)\n\nJelena Dokic was in awe watching Anismova peel off a backhand winner against Kimberly Birrell at the Brisbane International, saying she had the best backhand in the world: \u201cHave a look how low she gets down, [look at her] shoulder rotation, [and] hip rotation, [she] hits through the ball [and her] head is still.\u201d\n\nAnisimova\u2019s strength and power meant Rea had no hesitation in declaring her a standout when it came to the backhand.\n\n\u201cAt the US Open [last September when runner-up to Sabalenka] she actually hit the ball faster than Alcaraz and Sinner from A to B. She might have less spin on the ball, but from A to B she was faster than Swatiek, faster than Alcaraz, faster than Sinner, [and] faster than Djokovic for pure ball speed,\u201d Rea said.\n\n\u201cIf you gave me one backhand for my life it, would be Amanda Anisimova.\u201d\n\nBest drop shot: Mirra Andreeva (Russia)\n\nAndreeva is a rising star and her drop shot is top-notch. McNamee says the claycourt specialists generally have the best drop shots.\n\n\u201cAndreeva is your Martina Hingis of this era,\u201d he said, adding that while Sabalenka doesn\u2019t have the best drop shot it\u2019s an element of her game worth watching as she tries to add some nuance to her game.\n\n\u201c[Sabalenka] uses the drop shot to complement her power, and if she gets caught out of position on the return of serve she is actually prepared to take her medicine and get back in the point, trusting her movement to get back into the point after perhaps starting behind the eight-ball after having to chip ball back into play. That is an evolution in her game,\u201d Rea said.\n\nBest return of serve: Coco Gauff (USA)\n\nIn a recent interview with Kim Clijsters on Andy Roddick\u2019s Served podcast, the superbly skilled Ons Jabeur said she called Coco Gauff an Octopus because of her ability to return balls others would fail to reach.\n\nDespite Gauff\u2019s serve being below that of the best players, Roddick thinks people should focus on the qualities that keep her inside the top five.\n\n\u201cCoco Gauff sets up her defence with patterns\u2026 [she is the] best in the world at being uncomfortable and getting a W. She is a winner,\u201d Roddick said.\n\n\n\nThe yin and yang in women\u2019s tennis makes the tournament enthralling because Sabalenka and Rybakina\u2019s weapons are on the serving side, while Gauff and Swatiek are on the returning side. Gauff won an incredible 46.3 per cent of her return games in 2025.\n\nHandling pressure: Aryna Sabalenka (Belarus)\n\nKeys saved a match point against Swatiek in the semi-final en route to her breakthrough Australian Open decider, but Sabalenka, the world No.1, consistently rose to the fore when the pressure was at its fiercest throughout the year.\n\nHer US Open performance, when she came from one set down and faced a break point in the third set but did not buckle, was a real standout. In a 48-minute final set, where she blew two match points, Sabalenka eventually wore down Jessica Pegula to show her mental strength and win.\n\nAryna Sabalenka overcame difficulties in the US Open final to claim the title. Credit: Getty Images\n\nFitness: Mirra Andreeva (Russia)\n\nIga Swatiek admitted to being \u201csuper sore\u201d after the United Cup, so it was impossible to rate her as the fittest player heading into this year\u2019s Australian Open, despite her intense training regime.\n\nThe one to follow here is Andreeva, who runs herself ragged on court.\n\n\u201cFor a youngster, her ability to defend is phenomenal,\u201d Rea said.\n\nTeen sensation Mirra Andreeva. Credit: Eddie Jim\n\nAttempts the impossible: Karolina Muchova (Czechia)\n\nMuchova is in good form, making the semi-final of the Brisbane International after beating Rybakina, so she is far from a one-shot wonder. But being remembered for a shot such as her \u201ctweener\u201d at last year\u2019s Dubai Open is not a bad thing.\n\nFollow our live Australian Open blog each day from January 18 for results, news, analysis and interviews.\n\nNews, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Rudd was appointed Australian ambassador the U-S in March 2023 and was due to end his tenure next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, he will bow out a year early on the 31st of March, in a move announced by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, alongside Foreign Minister Penny Wong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He's always brought an extraordinary level of energy and discipline to public service. He's applied his relentless effort, his experience and his intellect and his determination to advance Australian interests in Washington, and Kevin Rudd has served the nation well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Albanese praised Dr Rudd's ability to develop deep relationships across the political spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder his tenure, Australia secured a $13 billion critical minerals deal with the US, and advanced the AUKUS security pact which will include the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As Prime Minister, I have visited the United States on no less than seven occasions. That is because of the productive work that Kevin Rudd has done across the board, including particularly advancing the economic relationship between our two nations, but also, of course, ensuring that AUKUS is able to proceed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Rudd is credited with helping achieve the return of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to Australia, ending a years-long legal battle on espionage charges.\n\n\n\n\n\nPenny Wong also applauded him for boosting U-S investment in Australian firms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Kevin's helped unlock billions of dollars in new investment and collaboration, including AI data centres and quantum in sectors that will strengthen the Australian economy and our security for decades to come. And he's put Australia's superannuation industry on the map with the United States, turbocharging U-S engagement and investment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut his past comments about the US President remained a sore point.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore becoming ambassador, Dr Rudd had labelled Mr Trump a \"traitor to the West\" on social media and criticised him in an online interview with an Indian politician.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The United States for the last four years has been run by a village idiot.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading to a tense exchange in the Oval Office when the Prime Minister visited President Trump in October.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump: Where is he, is still working for you\n\n\n\n(Laughter, He's right here)\n\n\n\nTrump: \"Did you say bad?\"\n\n\n\nRudd: \"Before I took this position Mr President,\"\n\n\n\nTrump: \"I don't like you either. I probably never will.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Rudd is stepping down to become the global president of the Asia Society and lead its Centre for China Analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Albanese insists Dr Rudd's departure is his own choice, and not based on his relationship with Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that one of the things about President Trump is that he looks forward on these issues and the relationship that Kevin has had with members of the Trump administration, whoever follows Kevin. If it's as good as that, I'll be pretty happy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKevin Rudd's resignation marks the effective end of his public life, to which he aspired from the age of 15, when he wrote to then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam asking for advice on how to become a diplomat and received a suggestion from the nation's leader that he study Asian languages.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was elected to federal parliament as the Labor member for Griffith in Brisbane in 1998, becoming leader of the Opposition just two years later.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2007, he led Labor to a rousing victory, ending 11 years of Coalition rule.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe quickly ratified the Kyoto protocol to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and in February 2008 delivered a historic apology to the Stolen Generations at Parliament House.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As Prime Minister of Australia, I am sorry. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe impressed international leaders with his fluent Mandarin, welcoming the Chinese president to Sydney for the APEC conference in 2007.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"President Hu, may I wish you and your party every success in Australia, and I join the Prime Minister in welcoming your gift of pandas to Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe steered Australia through the Global Financial Crisis and overturned his successor John Howard's unpopular industrial relations laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut his popularity plummeted when it came to addressing an issue he had campaigned passionately on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Climate Change is the great moral challenge of our generation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAbandoning legislation for a carbon emissions trading scheme when he failed to gain bipartisan support.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid rumours of a chaotic and controlling management style, he faced a shock leadership coup in June 2010 and stood down to make way for his deputy Julia Gillard.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was given the role of Foreign Minister, and in 2023 he was re-elected as party leader, becoming Prime Minister once again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rightly or wrongly, Julia has lost the trust of the Australian people, and starting on Monday, I want to start restoring that trust.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThree months later, he was defeated by Coalition leader Tony Abbott at the election and retired from parliament soon after.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the years that followed, he published two autobiographies and two books examining the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping, as well as receiving a PhD from Oxford University - making him, as the Prime Minister notes, well suited to a future in policy analysis and research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Kevin is regarded as perhaps the world's most eminent and sought after expert on China and China US relations.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Palestinian Australian author Randa Abdel-Fattah has publicly rejected an apology from Adelaide Festival's board, after it removed her from Adelaide Writers' Week 2026, which will now not go ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe board announced on Tuesday that it would cancel this year's festival, following the resignation of director Louise Adler and a mass boycott from invited authors protesting Abdel-Fattah's removal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because I have too much respect for myself and for my people, for those who have suffered irreparable harm by the board's conduct, for the brilliant Louise Adler who was forced on principle to resign, I refuse and reject the board's apology, Abdel-Fattah wrote on Instagram on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is disingenuous, it adds insult to injury,\" she said, adding that the apology only addressed \"how the message of my cancellation was conveyed, not the decision itself\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe board said its decision on 8 January to rescind her invitation had been made \"out of respect for a community experiencing the pain from a devastating event,\" but acknowledged it had instead created division.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We recognise and deeply regret the distress this decision has caused to our audience, artists and writers, donors, corporate partners, the government and our own staff and people,\" it said in a statement released on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We also apologise to Dr Randa Abdel-Fattah for how the decision was represented and reiterate this is not about identity or dissent but rather a continuing rapid shift in the national discourse around the breadth of freedom of expression in our nation following Australia's worst terror attack in history.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Louise Adler resigns as Adelaide Writers' Week director amid escalating festival crisis\n\nThe board initially claimed past statements from Abdel-Fattah meant it would not be \"culturally sensitive\" for her to appear at the festival so soon after the antisemitic terror attack at Sydney's Bondi Beach on 14 December.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdel-Fattah described the board's justification for her removal as explicitly targeting her identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think in this moment we must also pay close attention to some of the fault lines that are being drawn,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have to be very careful about the way the narrative is being framed to equate all speech as equal, undermining the right of marginalised people to call for the cancellation of those who incite harm in the name of liberal principles of the so-called marketplace of ideas \u2014 as we all know, Indigenous artists and writers of colour pay the price for.\"\n\n\n\n'Decision wasn't about identity or dissent'\n\nIn its statement on Tuesday, the Adelaide Festival board said Adelaide Writers' Week 2026 could no longer proceed after widespread withdrawals by writers, commentators and academics following Abdel-Fattah's removal. Around 180 participants had reportedly withdrawn in protest.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe South Australian government announced Judy Potter would become the new board leader. She previously led the board from 2016-2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cancellation follows last week's announcement that Abdel-Fattah's appearance at the literary festival had been cancelled. She is the daughter of Palestinian and Egyptian parents, and has been a vocal critic of Israel's treatment of Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has previously faced criticism from the Coalition, as well as some Jewish organisations and media outlets, over comments about Israel and Zionism, including a widely reported post in which she claimed Zionists had \"no claim or right to cultural safety\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Board members, chair quit from Adelaide Festival as fallout from dropped author grows\n\nAbdel-Fattah has said her objections and critiques of Zionism, a political ideology , have been conflated with antisemitism.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has also said her posting of an image of a Palestinian paratrooper soon after the October 7 attacks, a move that has also been criticised, was intended as a symbolic expression of besieged Palestinians \"breaking out of their prison\", and that she did not support the killing of civilians. She said she was unaware at the time of the scale or severity of the attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, the board said it was \"not culturally sensitive\" to proceed, a decision Abdel-Fattah described as \"outrageous\", saying she \"cannot believe\" she had to state she had \"nothing to do with the Bondi atrocities\".\n\n\n\nLegal challenge under consideration\n\nMichael Bradley of Marque Lawyers, who is representing Abdel-Fattah, said the collapse of the event was foreseeable once the board rescinded his client's invitation, but stressed that its inevitability did not diminish the seriousness of the outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The cancellation of the whole event was inevitable,\" he told SBS News, adding it was \"an incredibly sad thing to have happened and it was also completely unnecessary\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said responsibility lay with both the board and the South Australian government, arguing that the consequences flowed from their decisions rather than from any conduct by Abdel-Fattah.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"None of this has anything to do with Randa,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She was looking forward to sitting in the sunshine talking about her new book,\" he said, referring to her 2025 novel Discipline, which explores the experience of the Palestinian diaspora in Australia.\n\n\n\nBradley said Abdel-Fattah was now weighing her legal position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Randa will consider her options as she is with everything else that's going on,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said \"her rights have been very, very severely compromised\" and she had been \"done a lot of harm, none of which she provoked or deserved\".\n\n\n\nPremier defends stance as criticism mounts\n\nMeanwhile, South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas has faced questions over whether he sought to influence the board\u2019s decisions regarding Adelaide Writers' Week.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has rejected those assertions, telling reporters on Tuesday that the festival was \"strictly an independent exercise\" and \"not a government-run event\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What writers' week does with this community is up to them,\" he said earlier on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's their event, their decisions.\"\n\n\n\nSouth Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas said he had a responsibility \"to advocate against any rhetoric that I think inflames hate speech or Islamophobia or antisemitism or any other form of racism\". Source: Supplied / ABC Responding to questions about whether he'd exerted political influence, he drew a hypothetical comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Can you imagine if a far-right Zionist walked into a Sydney mosque and murdered 15 people? Can you imagine that as the premier of this state, I would actively support a far-right Zionist going to writers' week and speaking hateful rhetoric?\" he said in an emotional exchange with one reporter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Of course, I wouldn't, but the reverse has happened in this instance, and I'm not going to support that either.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE First Nations authors join boycott of Adelaide Writers' Week over the removal of Palestinian guest\n\nBradley described the comments as \"one of the most extraordinary statements I've ever heard from a public official, about a private citizen\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To come out with something so incendiary and unprovoked \u2014 I don't know why he's done that, it's a mystery,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe remarks came hours after Louise Adler resigned as director of Adelaide Writers' Week, warning of a broader erosion of artistic freedom.\n\n\n\n\n\nActing Greens leader and arts spokesperson Sarah Hanson-Young described the cancellation as \"a dark day for the arts in South Australia\", saying: \"Premier Peter Malinauskas must apologise for his intervention which has helped lead to this fiasco.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As Louise Adler has warned, writers' week is the canary in the coalmine.\"\n\n\n\n",

Credit: Getty Images\n\nAustralia has also failed to find a consistent chief to spearhead the side \u2013 Lynagh, Gordon, Tane Edmed and James O\u2019Connor have all been used since Noah Lolesio\u2019s Japan defection, while Donaldson has remained around the squad.",

Share A A A\n\nA naked couple sits on a mattress in the backyard of a terrace house, reading the newspaper, their backs to the camera. A motorbike and an assortment of pushbikes lean on the wall, a garden hose curls near an old drain, and dog\u2019s water bowl suggests there\u2019s an absent pet somewhere nearby. It\u2019s a gloriously evocative black-and-white photograph by Ponch Hawkes, typical of her work in the 1970s. Australia was undergoing a metamorphosis, emerging from decades of conservative government. Radical change was underway, with women\u2019s rights, second-wave feminism and sexual liberation in full swing. Hawkes documented those heady times and continues to do so, five decades on. Turning 80 next year, the acclaimed photographer is busier than ever, preparing for an exhibition of her paintings \u2013 a recent reacquaintance with the medium has turned into an obsession \u2013 and a survey show planned at the Museum of Australian Photography for winter 2028. Ponch Hawkes\u2019 No title (Summer night in the backyard at Falconer Street), circa 1975. Courtesy of the NGV Her images appear in the newly published Circus Oz: From the Pram to the World Stage, and she features in the documentary The Language of Light about seven Australian photographers on SBS on Demand. Some of her 1970s work is showcased at the NGV, in Women Photographers 1900-1975: A Legacy of Light. Her shots document that heady time and illustrate the changing social dynamics, capturing everyday moments like the above in communal houses, graffiti demanding childcare and social housing, protests about gay rights and women\u2019s liberation and a whole lot more. The images seem very uncurated, I say. \u201cWe were uncurated,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were all so incredibly happy with ourselves. We all thought we were so fabulous.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was punk, not in the sense of the Sex Pistols, but everybody was having a go at everything, trying out being a filmmaker or a writer or an artist or a photographer, in my case. With an overlay of social action and community giving and receiving.\u201d Places like the Pram Factory, La Mama and Circus Oz were in their infancy \u2013 the latter and its community remains a big part of her life; she was at a barbecue fundraiser for the rock\u2019n\u2019roll circus recently. \u201cI didn\u2019t ever do the trapeze but we all tried to learn to do things. The thing is, I had strength but no grace whatsoever,\u201d she says of its early days. Ponch Hawkes has been documenting our lives for five decades. Chris Hopkins One of the teachers was in traditional circus, which came with a particular type of training. \u201cYou\u2019re up hanging off a rope and she\u2019d happily let you wear the skin away, to see if you\u2019re tough enough, which I wasn\u2019t, really.\u201d Hawkes says it felt like the golden age: \u201cWhitlam was in, the economy was in good shape, there was full employment, rent was really cheap, interest rates were low-ish and so there was money for the arts.\u201d \u201dWe were turning people away \u2013 everything we did was completely sold out. I went on tour in a band with five other women, to schools and all sorts of incredible venues, doing a show about women\u2019s work, for which we had posters ... in different languages, so if we performed at a factory, people would know what we were doing... bold things like that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe contributed to Digger magazine, the short-lived but impactful counter-culture mag that focused on politics, sex, drugs and rock\u2019n\u2019roll. Several of the images in the NGV show were first published in it, as was the essay that led to Helen Garner\u2019s sacking as a teacher, for speaking with her high school students about sex. We\u2019re dining at Hawkes\u2019 favourite local, Matsuya, a Japanese restaurant in Fairfield. It\u2019s quiet and comfortable and the staff welcome her warmly. She orders the vegetable tempura with a side of horenso (cold spinach with sesame dressing, much more delicious than it sounds), while I opt for the deluxe bento box; we share the gyoza to start, plus Japanese tea. Our photographer Chris Hopkins arrives and soon takes Hawkes outside to get a portrait shot, despite it being a wild and woolly day. \u201cI\u2019m ready for lunch, but am I ready for you?\u201d she quips as they head outside. Ponch Hawkes. Chris Hopkins When she gets back, I wonder if she took a peek at the pics? No. (Later, when she sees his fabulous shot with her hair seeming to stand on end, she\u2019s impressed and hopes we publish it.) Often, Hawkes interviews people before shooting them. Everybody\u2019s got a story, she says. \u201cYou get a sense of what that story might be. Also, if it\u2019s a portrait and they need to present really well, sometimes people are really direct and go, \u2018Oh no, I look terrible from that side\u2019 \u2013 especially actors. But most people are completely unaware of how they present, so they\u2019re really trusting you for a portrait.\u201d That degree of trust is a big part of what she does, perhaps best illustrated by her recent 500 Strong series, which features 500 women over the age of 50 photographed naked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome use props to cover their faces, many grin, smile or gaze happily into the camera; all show bodies of all shapes and sizes. It\u2019s an extraordinary body of work and continues to tour around the country. \u201cI\u2019ve done a lot of projects about good and worthy subjects, but this is the only one I\u2019ve ever done that\u2019s actually made real change,\u201d she says. \u201cHardly a day goes by that I don\u2019t run into someone, or someone writes me an email or a letter saying how differently they feel about things since they did the project or saw the project. It\u2019s really moving.\u201d Born and raised in Abbotsford, Hawkes had three siblings; her dad was a laundryman at Abbotsford Convent and her mum sometimes worked as a cook in pubs. Part of a panel of 500 Strong. Ponch Hawkes Her dad played in the reserves for Collingwood and later trained local footy clubs; his family all played local footy, \u201cthey were big, strapping men\u201d. Now a self-confessed diehard Collingwood fan, she didn\u2019t re-engage with footy until later in life. \u201cI can\u2019t remember what it was but I became fully engaged,\u201d she laughs, even writing a spirited defence of Mason Cox when he was attacked in an online supporters group. Her miniature poodle wears a Pies jumper in a pic on her phone and her membership for the next season has just arrived in the mail. Being a Collingwood supporter means you commune with fellow supporters, \u201cno matter where they come from \u2013 that\u2019s what tribes are about\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe\u2019re both thrilled to see women playing Australian Rules, finally, even though the physicality of the game can mean it\u2019s sometimes hard to watch. \u201cBecause we\u2019re so unused to seeing girls tackle other girls or go in head-first or slam into people or do all the things we\u2019re used to in AFL. That\u2019s one of the reasons we love it so much, it\u2019s such a brutal bloody sport.\u201c Footy chat brings us to Helen Garner\u2019s wonderful book The Season, about her grandson and his local team. \u201cThat book made me feel glad to be alive and Helen\u2019s books aren\u2019t always like that... [it] was so full of joy. I just completely love her, she\u2019s such a brilliant writer.\u201d Helen and Gwen 1976, from the series Our mums and us by Ponch Hawkes. Ponch Hawkes/Museum of Australian Photography I find out over lunch that it\u2019s actually a young Garner in that photo described at the beginning of this piece. She also features in Hawke\u2019s series Our Mums and Us, which features mothers and their daughters photographed at their homes. It\u2019s a wonderful snapshot of time, borne out of the realisation \u201cthat your mother was not just your mother, she was a person in her own right\u201d. In 1976, it became her first exhibition. There are many similarities between their work: social realism and making art by documenting our lives, an incredible eye for detail, and a commitment to truth-telling.\n\nAdvertisement",
