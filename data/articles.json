        "text": "The Shroud of Turin \u2014 a 4.25-metre linen cloth bearing an image of a crucified man \u2014 has captivated people for centuries, stirring debate over whether the relic once wrapped the body of Jesus Christ.\n\nFor some, the cloth serves as visual proof of Jesus' resurrection; for others, it is merely a medieval relic made by an artist in the 14th century.\n\nNow, researchers have found new evidence that the authenticity of the cloth was disputed in writing earlier than once thought: medieval texts from a respected and influential French philosopher, Nicole Oresme, who alleged around 1370 that the Shroud was faked for the purpose of the church.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin \u2014 a 5.25 metre long linen cloth bearing an image of a crucified man \u2014 has captivated people for centuries. (Getty via CNN)\n\nThese claims appeared in Oresme's collection of writings known as his \"Problemata,\" which are dated between 1355 and 1382, according to the new study published on August 28 in the Journal of Medieval History .\n\nOresme's Problemata has been well researched \u2014 much of the text is even available online \u2014but the philosopher's claims about the Shroud had been overlooked for centuries. It wasn't until lead study author Nicolas Sarzeaud, a researcher in history at the Catholic University Louvain, in Belgium, received the text from a colleague editing an unpublished treatise that he realised the significance of the writing.\n\n\"The fact that we have this new testimony on this object is very, very valuable,\" said Sarzeaud, who is also a fellow of the Villa Medici, a French Academy in Rome. Oresme was an interesting figure, not only for his merit as a scholar and philosopher, but because of his unbiased approach to topics, particularly those involving the church. \"In his debates, he tried to be sure that a phenomenon was real before he (discussed it). \u2026 he wrote a lot about believing. 'What is believing? And why do we believe in something?'\"\n\nPrior to the discovery of Oresme's claims, the oldest known documentation of the Shroud was in a series of documents from 1389 to 1390 written by notable figures such as the former bishop of Troyes, Pierre d'Arcis, who stated that the Shroud was created by an artist.\n\nWhile researchers like Sarzeaud claim Oresme's text adds to the already plentiful scientific and historical evidence that the Shroud is fake, some remain unconvinced.\n\nOresme and the Shroud of Turin\n\nAccording to the 1389 documents, including a letter written by Bishop d'Arcis to the pope, the Shroud of Turin appeared in the Champagne region of France around 1355. The cloth, bearing an image of a naked man with long hair and a beard, as well as reddish-brown stains resembling wounds from crucifixion, quickly became popular. News spread that the fabric was believed to have once wrapped the body of Christ, and the Shroud was said to cause miracles.\n\nBishops and priests prayed in front of the Shroud of Turin in 2010 in the Cathedral in Turin. (Getty via CNN)\n\nShortly after, the documents noted, the bishop of Troyes, Henri de Poitiers, announced that the cloth was fraudulent, adding he had met the artist who created the image. About 30 years later, when the cloth began to attract popular attention once more, the following bishop, Pierre d'Arcis, also stated in his letter that the cloth was artwork, and the pope decided soon after that it could continue being on display only as a representation of the true Shroud of Christ.\n\nThe cloth moved around several times after that, until it was relocated to Turin, Italy, in 1578. It can still be found there today, at the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist.\n\nRadiocarbon dating, conducted in 1988 by three separate laboratories, dated the fabric between 1260 and 1390, said Andrea Nicolotti, a professor of the history of Christianity and churches at the University of Turin who was not involved with the study but had worked with Sarzeaud previously.\n\nThe Shroud shows evidence of being a relic from medieval times, as its patterns are complex and would have required a sufficient loom likely not introduced until the 13th century, added Nicolotti, who is also the author of the 2019 book \"The Shroud of Turin: The History and Legends of the World's Most Famous Relic.\"\n\n\"In my opinion, we already have enough information to have settled the debate a long time ago,\" he said.\n\n\"Since no human body can leave that kind of image on the cloth, only two possibilities seem to remain: either it was artificially created by an artist, or it is a miracle,\" Nicolotti said in an email. \"Being able to say that the shroud is the result of a miracle, and that it is proof of the resurrection, is very tempting for some Christians: they think this way they can demonstrate Christ's divinity to the world.\"\n\nIn his Problemata, Oresme recommended caution when assessing alleged miracles, \"because many clergy men thus deceive others, in order to elicit offerings for their churches.\" He cited the Shroud as an example: \"There is manifest experience of that in a church in Champagne, where it was said that there was the shroud of the Lord Jesus Christ.\" Oresme died in 1382, seven years prior to the claims from the bishop of Troyes in the 1389 letter.\n\nOngoing debate\n\nMore than 600 years after its documented discovery, the Shroud of Turin is still being researched and debated. In July, a study from a researcher in Brazil using 3D-modeling software concluded that the image on the cloth is more likely the result of an imprint from a statue rather than from a human body.\n\nThose who believe the Shroud to be authentic, however, argued that the 3D-modeling study was incomplete. Skeptics claimed that the researcher did not factor in findings from the 1978 Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) that could disprove the theory of the cloth being artwork, such as a lack of pigment and the details of the blood stains, which are detectable with UV technology.\n\nCheryl White, the Hubert Humphreys Endowed Professor of History at Louisiana State University at Shreveport, said that the newly examined texts from Oresme do not add much to our understanding of the Shroud and its debated authenticity. White was not involved in the new study.\n\n\"This reference points only to something I think historians have always known \u2014 that skepticism about the Shroud existed early on,\" White, who also served as the historical consultant for the original Shroud of Turin exhibition at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, DC, said in an email. \"There is no question (Oresme) was one of the leading intellectuals of 14th-century France, a bishop and royal advisor. His skepticism might carry more weight given his standing, but it actually reflects his broader fight against false relics more than drawing upon any direct knowledge he had of the Shroud itself.\"\n\n\"My position is that the Shroud of Turin has defied explanation for centuries. \u2026 It is neither falsifiable nor is it reproducible, making it an ongoing mystery,\" White added. \"We need both more historical documents and the most advanced scientific testing; however, the Shroud may never be 'put to rest' \u2014 its enduring mystery is what makes it so compelling.\"",

For most Australians working in corporate offices, it's a far-off dream.\n\nMore than 2.2 million Aussies aged 15 to 24 were employed in July 2025, most of whom have only ever known the chatter and distraction of open-plan offices.\n\nBut there was a time \u2013 one older members of the workforce still recall \u2013 when the cubicle reigned supreme in offices all over the country.\n\nCubicles made a comeback in the TV series Severance, but could they return to Aussie offices? (Apple TV+)\n\nA time before hotdesking and being exposed to every sight, sound and smell in the office was the norm, despite how detrimental it can be to our ability to actually work.\n\nBut as businesses try to coax \ufeffemployees back into offices after years of work-from-home (WFH) arrangements, could 2025 be the year Australia finally resurrects the cubicle?\n\nOne expert says it's not entirely out of the question.\ufeff\n\nThe death of the office cubicle\n\nOnce an Aussie office staple, cubicles were largely phased out by the 2000s.\n\nThey were meant to be an affordable alternative to private offices that still gave employees a sense of space and privacy.\n\nBut over time, some employees and employers came to view \"cubicle farms\" as oppressive and isolating.\n\nOnce an office staple, cubicles came to be seen as oppressive and isolating over time. (Getty)\n\nMany adopted \ufeffopen-plan layouts instead.\n\nPopularised by architect Frank Lloyd Wright\ufeff, egalitarian open-plan offices would \ufeffencourage workers to communicate, collaborate, solve problems and generate ideas.\n\nOr so the theory went.\ufeff\n\n\ufeff\"Unfortunately, it hasn't actually worked out that way,\" MBA director and Associate Professor of Organisational Behaviour at Bond University, Dr Libby Sander told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"If we look at a big body of research over the last 15 years, what it shows conclusively is that just putting people together in one room doesn't make them do all those things.\n\n\"In fact, it can often do the opposite.\"\n\nThe open-plan problem\n\nTo work in an open-plan office is to be distracted.\ufeff\n\nAussie workers report the constant noise makes it significantly harder to get work done, with some saying they can be \ufeffdistracted 80 times in a single morning.\n\nIt doesn't even need to be a direct distraction, like being asked a question or roped into a conversation, either.\n\nAussie workers report that open-plan offices are rife with distractions, much like the Dunder Mifflin office in The Office TV series. (NBC)\n\n\ufeffA study Sander ran found that \ufeffworkers exposed to standard open-plan office noise, even over a short period of time, experienced a 34 per cent spike in physiological stress and a 25 per cent increase in negative mood.\n\n\"When you couple that with the interruptions and distractions of people actually coming up and talking to you, or having a meeting next to your desk ... it's very, very difficult for people to do focused and concentrated work,\" Sander said.\n\n\"They become more withdrawn, even hostile in some cases ... because they get very, very frustrated that they just can't concentrate.\"\n\nResearch also shows it can take up to 20 minutes to get back on task after being distracted \u2013 and that's bad for business.\n\nIt's part of why so many Aussies have latched onto WFH arrangements and refuse to let go, even years post-pandemic.\ufeff\n\nThe highest paid jobs that let you work from home View Gallery\n\nThe rise of \ufeffhotdesking and \"activity-based working\" hasn't helped either.\n\nWhile it can work for some industries and roles, even Sander agreed \"a lot of people are very unhappy with\" having to share desks with colleagues that don't always clean up after themselves \u2013 if they can find a desk at all.\ufeff\n\n\ufeffResurrecting the cubicle - or something like it\n\nWith many businesses still trying to coax\ufeff workers back into the office, now seems like the perfect time to address the layout issues that make staff reluctant to return.\n\n\"Companies are starting to realise the impact that noise, distraction and interruption actually has on their employee, which is their biggest expense,\" Sander said.\n\n\"And that the savings you make in real estate by not giving everyone their own space, or cramming everyone into an open plan space, doesn't actually pay off in the long term.\"\n\nAccording to Sander, \"cramming everyone into an open plan space, doesn't actually pay off in the long term\". (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nBut the solution isn't as simple as resurrecting cubicles in every office.\n\nInstead, Sander recommended businesses design office layouts specific to \ufeffthe work employees need to get done.\n\nThat could mean cubicles, private offices, or a well-designed open-plan \ufefflayout with private spaces available.\n\nSome companies have already invested in small, free-standing office \"booths\" where staff can work without distraction.\ufeff\n\nIt may also mean allowing long-term WFH arrangements; whatever works best for staff just trying to get the job done.\ufeff\n\n\"There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer,\" Sander said.\n\n\"Because ultimately, you need to have a variety of options for people who have a variety of needs\ufeff.\"\n\nSmall, free-standing office 'booths' can allow staff to work without distraction. (Getty)\n\nAnd with a looming talent shortage, \ufeffaging populations and declining birth rates, businesses that don't try to meet staff needs risk falling behind those that do.\ufeff\n\n\"As we understand more and more the impact of noise and distraction, we are going to see better-designed offices with better acoustics, more dividers, less open-plan space, so people can actually concentrate and get their work done,\" Sander said.\n\n\"If you're not doing that, your competitors are already doing it or going to do it, and you're going to get left behind.\"\n\nHave you got a story?

(ABC News: Michael Franchi)\n\nDubbed Project Caymus, the $270 million fuel tank farm was announced in 2021, with works at the site beginning in January 2022.\n\nAmerican company Crowley won a tender from the US government to build and manage the tanks, which sit on NT government land.\n\nThe ABC has previously revealed the 11 tanks were constructed unlawfully without a building permit and were not designed to withstand winds of more than 193.5 kilometres per hour.\n\nWater has also been leaking into the base of the tanks, which are yet to hold fuel.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the NT's Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment, Josh Burgoyne, released a statement saying he had approved the tanks for operation, after they were signed off by an independent engineer hired by Crowley.\n\n\"I made a declaration under the Building Act that occupancy certification is not required for the fuel facility,\" he said.\n\n\"The current legislation does not allow for a building permit to be issued retrospectively.\"\n\nOccupancy certification is granted by a building certifier and shows that a structure has complied with all regulations.\n\nJosh Burgoyne did not respond to a question from the ABC asking if he ordered the departmental report on the tanks.

She's physically in a good position, also mentally.\"\n\nIt will be the 31-year-old's first match since she played in the Champions League against Swedish club H\u00e4cken just before Christmas in 2023, where, typically, she got on the scoresheet with her 99th goal in Chelsea blue.\n\nBut just a couple of weeks later, she suffered the anterior cruciate ligament injury that has sidelined her ever since, during which time she was also at the centre of a high-profile court case in which she was cleared of racially aggravated harassment of a police officer.\n\nBut now she is ready to at last resume her quest to score goal 100 for Chelsea \u2014 although the team has changed out of all recognition since she last played.\n\nIf she does take the pitch on Friday, she will probably have a Matildas teammate alongside her for the first time in the shape of Chelsea's new signing, Ellie Carpenter, from Bompastor's old club, Lyonnes.\n\nThe burning question remains: how has such a long period out following such a debilitating injury affected the game of one of the world's top players?\n\n\"It's nice because she is one of the players everyone wants to see on the pitch,\" said Bompastor, who was not in charge of the club when Kerr got injured.\n\nThe evolution of Sam Kerr We captured data tracing the evolution of Sam Kerr, from a 15-year-old playing in quiet suburban stadiums to the goal scoring machine she has become in England.\n\nBut the boss who led Chelsea to a sixth straight WSL title in May is happy to have her back.\n\n\"That's nice for me, with her leadership and experience,\" she said.\n\nHowever, she is urging Chelsea fans, who have become so used to watching the extraordinary goalscoring feats from their old favourite, to give Kerr time to rediscover her best.\n\n\"To be fair to her, she's been away from the pitch for a long time, so I think we still need to be patient,\" she said.\n\n\"That's normal for her not to be at her best level yet. Hopefully, soon, but that's already a good step for her and for us for her to be in the squad.\n\n\"She played some minutes in pre-season games but we cannot expect Sam, having not played for 15 or 16 months, to be immediately ready and at her best level.\n\n\"We need to be patient, even if you and I want to have Sam back because she's a wonderful player and we love watching her on the pitch.\"\n\nKerr's return also spells great news for the Matildas with the Women's Asian Cup in Australia looming next March.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

(ABC Western Plains: Zaarkacha Marlan)\n\nMs Brown's parents, Trina and John Brown, along with her sisters Angie Newman and Jessica Brown, attended the four-day hearing.\n\n\"She bought a splash of colour to all our lives,\" Ms Newman said.\n\nThey said Ms Brown, a mother of three, loved growing up and living in Lightning Ridge, and they hoped the inquest would bring change for rural health care.\n\n\"We choose to live in a small, remote community, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't have access to a high standard of health care and services,\" Ms Newman said.\n\nMs Brown's care at Lightning Ridge\n\nAn autopsy found Ms Brown had a hidden spleen injury, as well as a kidney infection that combined to cause septic shock and internal bleeding.\n\nHealthcare professionals from the Lightning Ridge Multi-Purpose Health Centre, which is one of NSW's most isolated medical facilities, gave conflicting accounts of the critical moments leading to Ms Brown's death.\n\nThe inquest was told that Ms Brown arrived at the centre's emergency department about 9:30am on July 1, reporting three days of vomiting, constipation and intense abdominal pain.\n\nShe was admitted to the acute care ward later that afternoon, where visiting doctor Irfan Hakeem treated her for an upper urinary tract infection.\n\nMedical care at Lightning Ridge is under the spotlight. (ABC Western Plains: Zaarkacha Marlan)\n\nDr Hakeem told the inquest that after a physical exam of Ms Brown, he did not suspect sepsis.\n\n\"Oxygen saturation was normal, the respiratory rate was normal,\" he said\n\n\"That told me it was infection and not sepsis.\"\n\nMs Brown's condition deteriorated overnight, and early the next morning she collapsed while trying to walk to the toilet.\n\nDr Hakeem, who was on-call at the time, said he was not told of Ms Brown's severe \"left-sided abdominal pain\".\n\n\"Yes, I should have seen her,\" he said.\n\n\" [Ms Brown's death] has been living with me since then. I am getting counselling. \"\n\nRegistered nurse Jamie Brizuela, who was caring for Ms Brown and in charge of the facility overnight, told the inquest he chose not to request Dr Hakeem's attendance, explaining he was not an \"assertive nurse\".\n\n\"I should have [requested him], but because there's some instances I've experienced of doctors who would get upset,\" he said.\n\nLater that morning, a request was made for the Royal Flying Doctor Service retrieval team to transfer Ms Brown to Dubbo Hospital.\n\nHowever, Ms Brown went into cardiac arrest about midday and was pronounced dead at 1:30pm on July 2, 2021.\n\nStaffing pressures\n\nRegistered nurse Emma Reavell was at the start of a 14-hour double shift due to a \"roster deficit\" when Ms Brown presented to the hospital.\n\nThe hearing heard all four acute beds and four emergency beds were occupied at the medical centre that night.\n\n\"It's a huge workload for one nurse,\" Ms Reavell told the inquest.\n\nThe inquest in Walgett has examined the care Eve Brown received. (ABC Western Plains: Zaarkacha Marlan)\n\nThe inquest heard protocol required Ms Brown's vital signs to be taken hourly while she was in the emergency department, and every four hours once admitted.\n\nBut her initial observations at 9:35am were not repeated until almost 12 hours later at 11:35pm.\n\n\"I don't recall what was going on, you get very busy in a small rural, remote facility, and you get distracted very easily and some things don't get done, I'm sorry to say,\" Ms Reavell said.\n\nNurse manager Kerry Irvin, who was also the acting health service manager that day, became visibly emotional when recalling Ms Brown's death.\n\nShe told the hearing she was \"horrified\" that vital signs were not recorded more regularly, but said nurses in small hospitals were often forced to juggle competing demands.\n\n\"Policy says hourly, but unfortunately, the reality is we only have so many staff to see so many patients, and so it becomes a juggling act,\" Ms Irvin said.\n\nFacility lacks tools for critical care\n\nThe inquest heard Lightning Ridge Multi-Purpose Health Centre did not have a CT scanner or surgical support, meaning complex patients were often transferred to Dubbo Hospital, 349 kilometres away.\n\nLightning Ridge patients are often flown long distances for treatment. (ABC News: Andrew O'Connor)\n\nEmergency physicians Matthew Bragg, Luke Lawton and Jeremy Hsu told the inquest early planning for transfers was critical for small rural hospitals, because delays could arise due to distance, weather, flight logistics and staff shortages.\n\nAll three experts agreed a consultation with the retrieval service should have occurred by 5pm the day Ms Brown presented to the hospital.\n\nMs Grahame will hand down her findings at a later date.",

        "text": "It's a world of anthropomorphic bugs, tucked away in a hidden ruined kingdom \u2014 and it's one of the most highly anticipated video games of all time.\n\nThe small game development studio based in Adelaide behind Hollow Knight have been almost entirely silent for seven years.\n\nNow they're back with its sequel \u2014 Hollow Knight: Silksong.\n\nThe original game sold more than 15 million copies, developed by Ari Gibson, William Pellen and Jack Vine of South Australia's Team Cherry with composer Christopher Larkin.\n\nWhen news broke of an impending sequel, excitement quickly grew to a fever pitch, increased by wild speculation at each tiny update.\n\nWhen it launched overnight, demand was so great that players crashed online PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo and PC stores.\n\nBut there was no big secret behind their tight-lipped timeline, just the desire to do exactly what they wanted.\n\nSo why did it take so long?\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg, developer Ari Gibson said that the development process was so enjoyable that the team just took the time to make the game they wanted to make, and dismissed concerns the game was halted in production.\n\n\"It was always progressing. It's just the case that we're a small team, and games take a lot of time. There wasn't any big controversial moment behind it,\" Gibson said.\n\nThe team at Team Cherry created a spritesheet, a large image which contains all the frames of animation for each pose and move that player character Hornet can take. (Supplied: Team Cherry)\n\nGibson said that due to the way the team developed the game, every idea that was conceived was added quickly to the game, and that he needed to stop sketching, otherwise the game would 'take 15 years to finish'.\n\nSize of the game grew significantly during development\n\nHow indie developers saved Australia's video game industry Photo shows A screenshot of an advertisement for a video game showing a cartoon lamb surrounded by other animals, in a red and black motif. Australia's video game industry has gone from being almost non-existent after the global financial crisis to pioneering in the space of 15 years.\n\nSilksong was originally intended to be an expansion for the first Hollow Knight game which was crowdfunded in 2014.\n\nThis new game features a new playable character called Hornet, a boss and secondary protagonist in first game, exploring her own story.\n\nGibson said in a recent interview that the scale of this new story meant it needed to be its own title.\n\n\"For a time, we imagined you would be able to dynamically switch to Hornet in Hollow Knight, she would have her own adventure and her abilities would allow her to access new areas,\" he told ACMI curator Jini Maxwell as part of the Game Worlds exhibition.\n\nGibson said that the scale of the game quickly grew and it made sense for the project to become its own sequel.\n\n\" We have a habit of expanding the content to be quite large, that led pretty quickly to the conclusion that Hornet would need to be in a new world, in a land that fit her scale and then also match her identity. \"\n\nWilliam Pellen said that the game in the team's mind was already a success, with their biggest hope being a smooth launch.\n\n\"The 'goal' is already kind of done. I think, we had an idea for a game that we wanted to make, a version of the game that satisfies the theme, the best version we can make,\" Pellen said.\n\n\"It's a hard one, honestly. I think just releasing it with no major bugs.\"\n\nOther studios delay their games to make room for Silksong\n\nOn the PC gaming platform Steam, the largest online store for video games, Silksong currently sits at number one on the wishlist chart with around 418,000 players following the title, 26,000 of those followers were added in just the last week.\n\nWhile the game appears to be two dimensional, it's actually a 3D game built in layers, similar to a theatre stage. (Supplied: Team Cherry)\n\nSo great is the anticipated impact of the launch of the game, a number of other video games have been delayed until later in the year or even early next year.\n\nSingaporean publisher Ysbryd Games said in a statement their title Demonschool originally slated for launch yesterday would be delayed because September would be 'Silksong's moment' and to allow their title 'to be seen and talked about meaningfully'.\n\nBaby Steps which was made by a team including Australian developer Bennett Foddy was another title pushed back, moving from September 8 two weeks later to September 23.\n\nA game that people keep discovering\n\nPellen said that the team was surprised with its enduring appeal, but that it spoke to their distinctive style that didn't age.\n\n\"The fact that people keep discovering Hollow Knight, the original, and this was our hope with it, suggests that it hasn't fallen out of date,\" Pellen said.\n\n\"The satisfying thing with Hollow Knight was that we were making something that was to our tastes, and that meant that we were making things that were slightly different it was inspired by older games, so its qualities were slightly different from the more modern games of the time.\n\n\"In a way that it's sort of outside of time, hopefully Silksong can achieve that too.\"",

        "text": "Wheeling a recycling bin to the curb can be a mundane weekly chore for many Australians, but for residents in remote regions across outback Queensland, those mainstream recycling services do not exist.\n\nTo combat the growing need and demand for recycling in the state's North West, a not-for-profit organisation hit the Gulf of Carpentaria's red dirt streets to do it themselves.\n\nGulf Containers for Change (C4C) is a container-refund scheme, collecting cans and bottles from residents and businesses for recycling for a return of 10 cents per item, which is reinvested into the community.\n\nMillions of containers have been collected by the Gulf Containers For Change depot. (Supplied: Robbie Katter)\n\nThe scheme diverted 4 million bottles and cans from landfill in 2024.\n\nAnd now, Gulf C4C is expanding its 270,000-square-kilometre patch to service Mornington Island, one of the most isolated regions in the country.\n\nLauren Christian, an executive general manager of COEX, the company facilitating Gulf C4C, said the expansion was environmentally and culturally significant.\n\nPartnering with Indigenous rangers on the island, containers will be collected and taken to the local barge.\n\nThey will then be shipped to the nearest mainland town, Karumba, for recycling.\n\nMornington Island will now have a Containers for Change service. (Supplied: Mornington Island Life)\n\nMs Christian said expanding the scheme to the island of 1,200 people had the potential to save thousands of containers from litter and landfill, and the 10-cent-per-item refund would be invested back into the community.\n\n\"The rangers have been really passionate about keeping plastic bottles and cans out of the environment,\" she said.\n\n\"We have a number of really engaged community advocates who understand the benefits of recycling and the benefit from an economic, a social and an environmental perspective.\"\n\nCleaning up country\n\nGulf C4C director Annie Cork is based in Normanton, a small town 500 kilometres north-east of Mount Isa, and loads up her truck every day, ready to collect thousands of containers.\n\nAnnie Cork and her husband Joseph run Gulf Containers for Change. (Supplied: Annie Cork)\n\n\"Unlike probably most of the other depots, we go out and do household collections,\" she said.\n\n\"We've got two trucks and two trailers \u2026 there's a huge amount of kilometres \u2014 as you could imagine \u2014 that we'd cover.\"\n\nMs Cork said the scheme ticked all the boxes for the Gulf.\n\n\"You're not only cleaning up country, but people are getting paid,\" she said.\n\n\"It's cleaned up towns immensely. It's generating quite a bit of revenue back into the economy.\n\nThe collection has proven popular with residents. (Supplied: Robbie Katter)\n\n\"We do a massive amount of cattle stations as well, the ones that are not a million miles off the road, and they're really appreciative of it.\"\n\nGarbage in the sticks\n\nAt Stirling Station, 100 kilometres north-east of Normanton, the only waste-management system was a personal landfill built on the property.\n\nBut Gulf C4C has changed that.\n\nWorkers at Stirling Station collect bottles and cans to fund their end of year event. (Supplied: Cheryl Ryan)\n\n\"[Containers] would just go into the dump, because we'd have nowhere else to take them,\" station manager Cheryl Ryan said.\n\n\"We just can't go and do what they do [in the city] when someone collects it. It's all up to us to look after it.\n\n\"Our workers put all our tins and plastics in a bin and our bottles in a separate one, and then we collect them in the bigger bins, and then we take them when someone's going into town.\"\n\nBut for the workers on the station, it is about more than just recycling.\n\nContainers for Change is the only available recycling scheme in many rural towns. (ABC Western Queensland: Grace Nakamura)\n\n\"We have all our young workers and we have a social club, and we thought it was a good way to get a little bit of money to take them out fishing on a boat at the end of the year,\" Ms Ryan said.\n\n\"It's a benefit. You're helping the environment by recycling \u2026 and it's just that bit of money in your pocket as well.\"",

I will continue to support this club passionately.\"\n\nLevy's departure comes several months after Tottenham ended a 17-year trophy drought by beating Manchester United 1-0 to win the Europa League final under the guidance of Australian manager Ange Postecoglou.\n\nIt was the first major title for Spurs since they won the English League Cup in 2008, and first European triumph since they won the UEFA Cup \u2014 the equivalent of the Europa League now \u2014 for the second time in 1984.\n\nWeeks later, Levy and other Spurs powerbrokers decided to sack Postecoglou.\n\nKnown as a fierce and uncompromising negotiator in the transfer market, Levy was also accused by many Tottenham fans of chasing profits over silverware in failing to fully back some of the most high-profile managers in soccer that he employed in recent years, such as Jose Mourinho and Antonio Conte.\n\nAnge's Spurs sacking the sad reality for awful league campaign Photo shows Tottenham Hotspur head coach Ange Postecoglou looks on during the post-season friendly match Ange Postecoglou flew into the Spurs job on a wing and a prayer, and surpassed expectations immediately.

US jobless claims were higher than forecast, while ADP Payrolls data undershot expectations. While the mainstream view on the latter has been that it has no predictive value when it comes to the official employment figures, that notion is being reconsidered.\n\n\"Although it's true that the ADP figure rarely shows any meaningful relationship to the official report the week of their release, it's been demonstrated that it's quite a reliable indicator of labour market activity following revisions to the NFPs.\n\n\"When piling on top of that a market that's more wary of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' credibility because of President Trump's attacks on the institution, as well as the proven shortcomings in its analytical process, the ADP is taking on greater import.\n\n\"The Non-Farm Payrolls data tonight is something of a sink or swim moment for the markets. The critical question is whether the slowdown in employment is continuing and gathering pace, and whether the Fed is in the right position to lower rates and buffer the economy, or if it's behind the curve. Should the data point to an economy accelerating off a cliff, that could spark risk aversion and volatility in the markets. Consensus forecasts point to a relatively modest 75,000 job increase in the US economy last month, with the unemployment rate tipped to rise to 4.3%. The devil will be in the details, too. A recent fall in the participation rate, a lot to do with US President Trump's immigration policies, has masked underlying weakness in labour demand.\"",

But instead of bringing relief, the sight of them heightened her fears; not a single woman was among them. Afghan cultural norms, enforced even in emergencies by the ruling Taliban, forbid physical contact between men and women who are not family members. In the village of Andarluckak, in Kunar province, the emergency team hurriedly carried out wounded men and children, and treated their wounds, said Aysha, 19.

He added, \u201cThe men and children were treated first, but the women were sitting apart, waiting for care.\u201d If no male relative was present, he said, rescue workers dragged dead women out by their clothes so as not to make skin contact.

Credit: AP More than 2200 people died and 3600 others were injured in the magnitude 6 quake that flattened countless hamlets and villages, according to figures released by Afghanistan\u2019s government. The response to the quake on Sunday has epitomised the dual standards that women and girls face in Afghanistan, aid groups and humanitarian organisations say, trapped both under the rubble and the weight of gender discrimination. \u201cWomen and girls will again bear the brunt of this disaster, so we must ensure their needs are at the heart of the response and recovery,\u201d the special representative for UN Women Afghanistan, Susan Ferguson, said in a statement this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the Taliban have not released a gender breakdown of the casualties, women have faced an especially harsh ordeal, made worse by neglect and isolation, more than half a dozen doctors, rescue workers and women in areas hit by the quake said in interviews. Afghanistan faces a critical shortage of healthcare workers and, in particular, of women in that field. Last year, the Taliban imposed a ban on women\u2019s enrolment in medical education. The dearth of female doctors and rescue workers has been all too evident in the wake of the earthquake. Injured Afghan men wait to be treated at a hospital in Jalalabad on Tuesday. Credit: AP Women and girls in Afghanistan face some of the world\u2019s most severe restrictions under the Taliban, who took power four years ago and have remained unflinching, even as most of the Muslim world, countless human rights organisations and bodies like the World Bank have warned against the long-lasting effects of such policies on the country\u2019s social fabric and economy. Girls are prohibited from going to school beyond sixth grade. Women cannot travel far without a male companion and are barred from most jobs, including in nonprofits and humanitarian organisations. Afghan women working for UN agencies have faced repeated harassment, culminating in threats so serious this year that the agencies instructed their female employees to temporarily work from home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Afghanistan, strict cultural and religious norms mean that only a woman\u2019s close male relative \u2013 her father, brother, husband or son \u2013 is permitted to touch her. The same applies in reverse: Women are not allowed to touch men outside their family. In disaster zones, female rescuers are restricted from assisting men. But a woman can pull unrelated women out from under debris. A New York Times journalist who reached the Mazar Dara area the day after the quake didn\u2019t see any women among the medical, rescue or aid teams treating victims. In one district hospital visited, there were no female staff members. When a trickle of nurses and humanitarian workers began reaching the affected areas by Tuesday, only a few were women. Soldiers followed them and prevented journalists from asking questions or photographing them. A spokesperson for the Taliban-run Ministry of Health acknowledged that there was a lack of female health workers in the quake-ravaged areas. \u201cBut in hospitals in Kunar, Nangarhar and Laghman, the largest number of female doctors and nurses are working, especially to treat earthquake victims,\u201d Sharafat Zaman, the spokesperson, said of the worst-hit provinces.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Championship leader Oscar Piastri is now 34 points ahead of Lando Norris after his teammate\u2019s forced retirement in the closing stages of the Dutch Grand Prix. With a maximum of 249 points on offer to any individual driver in the final nine rounds of the season, Piastri is by no means across the finish line yet. With everything we know from their two seasons together, and what we have learned this year, we take a look at whether Piastri can cruise to victory in the final nine rounds and three sprint races to become the first Australian F1 champion since Alan Jones in 1980, or whether Norris can reel him in. Here\u2019s our race-by-race verdict. Italian Grand Prix\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs was most often the case in 2024, Norris qualified ahead at Monza last year but not by a great deal. Just over a tenth of a second separated the pair. That is very much as it has been in 2025. The race, though, was where Piastri asserted his authority over Norris. He qualified one spot behind but put a bold move on his teammate at the second chicane on the opening lap, taking the lead. On the day, he lost out to Ferrari\u2019s one-stop strategy, but still finished in front of Norris. The high-speed Monza circuit is a track where pushing too hard can lead to a locked brake and losing time that\u2019s difficult to get back in qualifying. Could Norris\u2019s new all-out attack approach hinder him in Italy? Our verdict: Piastri Azerbaijan Grand Prix Looking at their results from the past two seasons, Azerbaijan is one of only two races where Piastri has an advantage in average finishing position. That is largely thanks to his victory there last year, which was more decisive and impressive than his maiden grand prix win in Hungary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOscar Piastri on the podium after winning the 2024 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Credit: NurPhoto via Getty Images It is difficult to directly compare Norris\u2019s 2024 performance in Baku to Piastri, given a mistake in qualifying, but surely an imperious win there \u2013 and a bold overtake \u2013 will give the Australian the edge. That said, Norris fought back from 16th on the grid to fourth, and the McLaren car is likely to be strong. Our verdict: Piastri Singapore Grand Prix Whilst it is not universally true, Norris has tended to excel on street circuits. In Singapore last year, his advantage in both qualifying (0.4sec) and the race (first to Piastri\u2019s third) was fairly pronounced, as it was in 2023. Singapore is also a more traditional street circuit, a little closer in style to Monaco, where Norris won in May, than Baku. Given Piastri\u2019s rapid improvement in almost all areas, he should pose more of a threat this year. If Norris can remain error-free in qualifying, then he should go down as favourite at Marina Bay. Our verdict: Norris\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnited States Grand Prix Norris was clearly ahead of Piastri at the Circuit of the Americas last year, with a gap of 0.6 seconds in qualifying. Piastri did not even make it out of the first part of sprint qualifying either, whilst Norris was fourth. It is difficult to see him putting a gap like that on Piastri in 2025, given the Australian\u2019s progress from last season to this. Still, Norris likes this track, and Piastri has struggled. Advantage Norris. Our verdict: Norris Mexico City Grand Prix\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking at results from 2023 and 2024, Mexico City is a track where Norris has the largest advantage statistically. That was primarily because Piastri only qualified 17th last season, whilst Norris qualified third before his controversial tussle with Verstappen. Yet in 2023, Norris qualified in 19th but managed to charge through the field to finish ahead of Piastri, who started seventh. It\u2019s fair to say that something has not quite clicked for the Australian in Mexico. Our verdict: Norris Oscar Piastri at the 2024 Mexican Grand Prix. Credit: Getty Images Brazilian Grand Prix Looking at the form book for Sao Paulo is not the most useful because of how wet and chaotic last year\u2019s event was. Again, the Briton holds the better record during the past two years. In two grand prix and two sprint races, Piastri has only scored 11 points to Norris\u2019s 43 in the same period. Yet, that would have been the case at plenty of tracks throughout 2025, too. Look how that has played out. Let\u2019s not forget that Piastri took the sprint pole and was on course to win before moving over and handing victory to his team-mate.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Heather Wilkinson, along with Don and Gail Patterson, could not tell their stories as they died terrible deaths in this monstrous plot. When it became Patterson\u2019s defence team\u2019s turn, it was clear their egg and spoon would be no match for the sword of justice. In a normal plea, the offender\u2019s lawyers usually call character witnesses to say sure, their client may be a homicidal maniac, but they care for rescue dogs, donate to charity and buy cookies from Girl Guide fundraisers. They then produce a psychiatry report to say their client had a terrible childhood, was brought up by wolves in the jungle and got hit in the head by lightning when they were five. But Patterson\u2019s lawyers couldn\u2019t do that as Erin maintains she is innocent and the victim of such a monstrous injustice not seen since the witch trials in Salem.\n\nOne tactic the defence could have explored would have been to say that while Patterson maintained her innocence, she was prepared to waive an appeal so that her surviving family, including her children, could get on with their lives. That might have got her a three to five-year discount. But that is not in Patterson\u2019s DNA. She is the victim. She asked to have her trial at Morwell then whinged and whined about her cell conditions, no doubt writing a stinging review on Tripadvisor. Erin Patterson arrives at court for her plea hearing. It did not go well. Credit: POOL With yet another complaint, she told a custody officer: \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it is like to suffer.\u201d Everything is relative. Being painfully and deliberately poisoned so that your vital organs shut down is suffering. Not having a fluffy pillow in your watchhouse bunk is more an inconvenience.\n\nWhile she says she is the biggest patsy since Lee Harvey Oswald, her senior barrister, Colin Mandy, SC, took a more sensible route. \u201cThis is very grave offending, and we make no argument that the sentence should be anything other than life imprisonment, but the issue is whether there should be a non-parole period,\u201d he told Beale. Patterson is aged 50 and has already served nearly two years. Mandy wants the judge to set a minimum of 30 years so she could be out when aged about 80. Mandy must surely acknowledge this submission is ambitious. Barrister Colin Mandy, SC, outside court with Erin Patterson\u2019s legal team of Sophie Stafford (left) and Ophelia Hollway. Credit: Jason South In fact, the plea backfired. Out of the blue her team said Patterson was suffering from autism. It would appear to be another Erin self-diagnosis as she didn\u2019t provide a medical diagnosis or even a sick note from a teacher.\n\nOf course, we remember that she used a fake cancer diagnosis to lure her victims to the deadly beef Wellington lunch and so another piece of medical trickery is unlikely to endear her to the judge. To make the point, prosecutor Jane Warren said in court: \u201cThe evidence just isn\u2019t there.\u201d Beale responded, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a lot of credibility ... you\u2019re pushing on an open door.\u201d More appropriately he could have said she has stepped onto a trapdoor. The judge said he had read 28 victim impact statements, affecting four generations of the families, describing it as a tsunami.\n\nProsecutor Warren came off the long run wanting the judge to throw away the key. \u201cIt is a crime that is so cruel and so horrific that, in our submission, the offender is not deserving of this court\u2019s mercy.\u201d Mandy played his strongest cards. Patterson will do jail hard. She will have to be in protection for years, which is solitary confinement. She can chat to her neighbour through some mesh but as that neighbour is a committed, barking-mad terrorist, the dialogue will hardly be witty. Patterson will not see her children grow up and has ruined her life. But she finished three lives and damaged many more. Former husband Simon Patterson told the court how he and his children had been stalked by the media and how they were made to feel as if they were the prize targets in a massive story not of their making.\n\nBeale has listened and acted. After a plea hearing, a judge usually takes months to write their sentencing remarks. In this case, he has broken speed records to be back in court on Monday. Loading He wants this off the books, not for his sake but the sake of the victims in the hope that the searing light of publicity dims \u2013 at least temporarily. Contrary to the view that sentencing judges can be soft or tough, they really have to stay within the lanes with sentencing guidelines and a nod to previous cases. And contrary to public perception, sentencing, at least at the serious end, has become tougher.\n\nIn 1987, Julian Knight murdered seven people and wounded 19 in a mass shooting in Hoddle Street. He received life with a minimum of 27 years. That is about four years per killing with no punishment for the wounding. Loading More astonishing was the fact the prosecutor said there should be a minimum sentence. Decades later, the government stepped in to ban him from parole. Back then, we in the media would get it wrong. The headline would be the main sentence not the minimum that was the real sentence.\n\nOnce inside, an offender would get a further discount for good behaviour. So a murderer who was sentenced to life with a minimum of 21 years would probably serve only 14 and with a few cunning tricks, serve even fewer. Beale has a balancing act. Life with no minimum would likely lead to an appeal on sentence, dragging the case out for another year. If the judge shows mercy, it will not be for Patterson but for the survivors who want this circus ended. If she gets a minimum and appeals, the prosecution could again ask for life potentially extinguishing any chance she will be freed. One case he may look at is that of Ashley Mervyn Coulston who in 1992 went to a house in Burwood to answer an ad for a tenant. He tied up the three people in the house, Kerryn Henstridge, 22, Anne Smerdon, 22, and Peter Dempsey, 27, and executed them.\n\nNo motive was ever established. After trials and retrials, he was finally sentenced to life with Justice Norman O\u2019Bryan saying: \u201cYou have forfeited forever your entitlement to live outside the confines of a prison.\u201d Beale will consider how tough Patterson\u2019s jail time will be. But it is hard to think of a worse crime. Loading She researched methods of murder for months, perhaps years. She decided death cap mushrooms would be the best poison, went out and foraged for the right ones then plotted the crime she believed could be written off as a horrible accident. Although her prime target was ex-husband Simon, she proceeded with the deadly lunch in the hope he would change his mind. When he didn\u2019t, she prepared the deadly beef Wellingtons, served them to her four guests then prayed with them.\n\nShe made small talk watching as they took bite after bite, then watched as Don finished his wife\u2019s leftovers. A hot lunch from the coldest of killers. As soon as they were gone, she headed to the local tip to dump evidence, faked similar symptoms when her guests fell ill, concealed evidence, lied, used her kids as alibi witnesses, and has not once, not ever, shown the slightest sign of remorse. The judge will also know she will not re-offend. No one in their right mind would eat anything she served up after she serves her time. Beale would be well within the law to sentence her to life with no minimum, but if he sets a non-parole period, it will be close to 40 years. The defence would like her eligible for release by the time she is 80. It will be closer to 90, if at all.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size There are two types of music, the old joke goes \u2013 country and western \u2013 and in Australia right now, they\u2019re both riding high. While the last couple of years have seen the live music and festival sector generally struggle, country (the western has long since been put out to pasture) has been experiencing an unprecedented surge in popularity. \u201cCountry music isn\u2019t just growing,\u201d says Kevin Azzopardi, marketing director of ticket reseller Tixel, which has just released its fourth annual State of Play report into the health of the live music sector in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s booming at the moment.\u201d Tixel\u2019s survey, produced in collaboration with marketing consultancy Bolster, draws on a survey of more than 2700 music fans (not just Tixel customers), as well as industry research and interviews with promoters, managers, and senior label and festival personnel. Young listeners, such as this group of fans at Honky Tonks in Brisbane\u2019s Fortitude Valley, are tuning in to country music like never before. Credit: Markus Ravik And while the overall picture is of a live music industry slowly regaining its footing after a tough few years marked by pandemic shutdowns, cost-of-living pressures, and changing consumer behaviour, in the formerly niche area of country music, everything is coming up roses. Country music fans attend more live events, and spend more at those events \u2013 on food, drink, transport and merchandise \u2013 than fans of other genres. And there\u2019s more of them than ever before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading \u201cThey spend 57 per cent more than regular consumers,\u201d says Azzopardi. \u201cAnd country music attendance has jumped 54 per cent since 2023. We\u2019re seeing country grow in all areas. We\u2019re seeing it take over socials \u2026 there\u2019s country core, this fashion trend that\u2019s emerging, as well. And so I think there\u2019s a whole cultural phenomenon at the moment around country.\u201d Though as a genre it sits well behind the biggest categories \u2013 pop at 59 per cent of respondents leads the way, with rock (49 per cent) and EDM/electronic (almost 45 per cent) close behind \u2013 country was up from 9 per cent in 2023-24 to 14 per cent in 2024-25. And much of the growth is coming from young people in the capital cities. Bella Bown, a 26-year-old office worker from Bayswater in Melbourne\u2019s outer eastern suburbs, is one such fan. In her early 20s, she says, her taste in music leaned towards house or the kind of pop she heard on commercial radio. Melbourne\u2019s Bella Bown is among a new generation of country music fans. Credit: Wayne Taylor \u201cMy brother was a huge fan of country, but I used to say, \u2018Why do you listen to that?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then, four or five years ago, I don\u2019t know, something changed.\u201d And what was it about country that hooked her? \u201cIt makes you happy when you\u2019re sad,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it makes you feel a part of something.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBown\u2019s first big concert was Luke Combs in August 2023. \u201cWe were in the mosh pit,\u201d she recalls, \u201cand the vibe just made me fall more in love with country music.\u201d American Combs, who has almost 26 million monthly listeners on Spotify and had three albums in last year\u2019s ARIA top 100 chart, is both contributor to and barometer of the growth of country music in Australia. When he first toured in 2018, he played The Forum in Melbourne and the Enmore in Sydney, in front of a couple of thousand people. By 2023, he was playing Rod Laver in Melbourne (capacity around 14,000) and QUDOS in Sydney (21,000). Last year, he was packing venues three or four times that size. Luke Combs is leading the country crossover into the mainstream. Credit: Wolter Peeters \u201c[A few years ago] you were struggling to fill smaller arenas [with international country artists],\u201d says Dobe Newton, long-standing member of The Bushwhackers and current chair of the Country Music Association of Australia. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden, here\u2019s Luke Combs, the first country artist to not only headline stadiums, but actually sell them out. You know, 320,000 people over six concerts.\u201d Loading In July, the CMAA released its latest census (the last was in 2019). And the story it told was remarkable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2024-25, country music generated revenue of $1.11 billion, a 79 per cent increase on the $619 million reported in 2019. Around half of that spend ($587 million) was from ticket sales. The report claimed 3.26 million people attended country music shows across the year. Crucially, there was no Taylor Swift bump in those numbers, because while country music as a genre is a remarkably broad church, Tay-Tay has excommunicated herself. \u201cShe went to enormous trouble to remove the country signature banjos and fiddles from early recordings,\u201d says Newton, referring to her re-recording of her back catalogue under the \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d rubric. Taylor Swift has worked hard to distance herself from her country music origins. Credit: Invision \u201cThat\u2019s her decision, and I think most people would recognise that she\u2019s not regarding herself \u2013 and therefore most people don\u2019t regard her \u2013 as a country artist. Though now she\u2019s seen the uptick in country, she may produce new versions of those albums with the banjos back in. It would certainly make the next census look pretty damn good.\u201d As country music talent and branding director at Frontier Touring, where she works across the CMC Rocks and Ridin\u2019 Hearts country music festivals, Georgie Luxton has witnessed the explosion in popularity up close. \u201cThere is definitely a new generation of fan,\u201d Luxton says. \u201cI think social media, and especially TikTok, has helped expand people\u2019s view of what country is, the whole breadth of country artists. That platform has really helped give recognition to the genre.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the city-based single-day festival Ridin\u2019 Hearts was launched three years ago, it drew around 3000 people in Melbourne and 4000 in Sydney. This year, they expect to sell between 8000 and 9000 tickets in each city. CMC Rocks \u2013 which turns 20 in 2027 \u2013 will have about 25,000 people onsite in Willowbank in Queensland on each of its three days next March. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many artists coming out at the moment,\u201d Luxton says. \u201cThree or four years ago, we would maybe have been doing like five country tours. Next year, it\u2019s like five festivals, plus at least, I would say, 15 country tours coming through.\u201d Loading The mainstreaming of country owes something to its uptake by some of the world\u2019s biggest pop stars. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Beyonce crossing genres [with her Cowboy Carter album], you\u2019ve got Chappell Roan releasing country singles, you\u2019ve got Post Malone doing collaborations with Taylor Swift,\u201d notes Azzopardi. But country is taking hold at a grassroots level too \u2013 with rodeos, line-dancing classes and country-themed club nights spreading like wildfire. There\u2019s even been the emergence of a cosmic-country/ambient Americana strand in electronic music. \u201cIt really has exploded,\u201d says Luxton. But for every inner-city hipster lining up for a boot-scooting session in Melbourne\u2019s Brunswick or dropping an ironic yee-har at Jolene\u2019s in the Sydney CBD, there are those who prefer to take their country straight, no chaser.

Tyler Manoa may have jeopardised his NFL career moments after blowing the Viking horn. Credit: Fox Sports Canberra had reached out to a number of celebrities - including Dana White, Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and Las Vegas Raiders head coach Pete Carroll - in the hope they would be available. When they all declined, Manoa - who is yet to make his run-on NFL debut - was enlisted for the job. Shortly after blowing the horn, Manoa was ejected from the stadium for misbehaviour in the corporate area. Then a member of the Las Vegas Raiders\u2019 practice squad, it\u2019s alleged Manoa damaged property inside the restrooms, with some reports suggesting he was also tasered.\n\nManoa was scheduled to make a guest appearance in the Canberra sheds after their win against the New Zealand Warriors, but was a no-show. With the NFL season just a month away, the Raiders have cut Manoa, making him a free agent. However, it\u2019s been reported that he will cop a two-game NFL suspension, said to be linked to the Allegiant Stadium incident, that could be a turn-off for prospective employers.The NFL announced on Sunday (AEST) that Manoa had been suspended due to \u201cconduct detrimental to the league\u201d.

And at that time, it didn't make sense to me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as she stayed in the sector for longer, she realised the template existed.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following decade, the Zimbabwe-born nurse applied for various opportunities to progress her career, only to find she often didn't make it to the final stage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I did put out some applications, and in one of the applications, I was promised I was going to get an opportunity, but that opportunity never came, but everyone else who had applied who met the criteria was able to progress.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs one of the critical sectors that face a labour shortage, the federal government has been prioritising visas for nurses in the skilled migration system.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Mauwa says in the 25 years she has lived in Australia, she has seen the workforce become more culturally diverse - but barriers still exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the health system is happy if we (are) just working on the floor, but not wanting to progress into management or senior roles, so that is where it becomes a challenge.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA new report by the New South Wales Nurses and Midwives Association found two-third of nurses and midwives from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds in the state have experienced racism at work.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 3,000 nursing union members were surveyed for the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne in five said they have been verbally abused or insulted; and one in 10 said they had been subjected to name-calling by patients, clients or colleagues.\n\n\n\n\n\nRace Discrimination Commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman says the report shows racism is a public health emergency that must be dealt with urgently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Put simply, racism is making people sick. Racism is stopping people who are sick from getting better, and racism is making people who are sick get worse.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Sivaraman says while he launched a National Anti-Racism Framework last year, he hasn't seen governments put it into action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And the report that the New South Wales Nurses and Midwives Association courageously prepared off the back of feedback from their members shows that the recommendations; and our framework, which align completely with the recommendations and their report, need to be implemented.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe nursing union's report calls on employers to ensure all staff complete bystander action education.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also makes another eight recommendations, including: prioritising the elimination of institutional racism; policies and training on incident reporting; and monitoring the effectiveness of co-designed anti-racism training.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general secretary at NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association, Shaye Candish, says the union has launched a partnership to ensure progress is made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It will be chaired by the Human Rights Commission, and we will have participants from governments, from employers, from the union, from the advocacy groups, from all stakeholders involved in this collaborative. The reality, unfortunately, is that racism is a pervert problem, and it is a really layered and complex problem. It's going to take a lot of work and commitment from organisations. But it's also going to take a collaboration from all of our organisations, because there is no one simple solution, and there is no one organisation that can fix this on their own.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNew South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park says there are robust anti-racism policies in place, but individuals need to work together to ensure they are implemented.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition is in damage control after Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price made false claims that Labor was taking in more migrants from certain backgrounds to bolster their vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nSingling out Indians coming to Australia, Senator Price made the allegations on ABC's Afternoon Briefing, following a series of anti-immigration rallies in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is a concern with the Indian community, because there's been large numbers and we can see that reflected in the way that the community votes for Labor at the same time. So if they're going to see a reflection that okay these individuals are going to vote for us more so than other parts of the community; will then of course they're going to express the view that will get those sorts of individuals into our communities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAn hour after making the remarks, she issued a statement saying she made a mistake, adding that Australia \"maintains a longstanding and bipartisan non-discriminatory migration policy\".\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage used by organisers and speakers at the weekend's anti-immigration rallies - and in promotional materials - have been condemned by experts for fuelling misinformation on immigration data - and for targeting Indian Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Price says she believes that raising concerns about migration does not mean that you are racist.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Opposition leader Sussan Ley told Sky News, the Coalition's migration policy is not discriminatory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Every day that I'm opposition leader, I'm fighting for every single Australian, no matter where you came from, and our Australian Indian community are amazing. You contribute as Australian Indians, so much to our country. We know how hard you work, your family values, and the contribution you make across this country, and as opposition leader, I value that incredibly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it is important to note that Senator Price has since corrected her comments.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Senator Price doubled down on the comments, telling reporters in Canberra that she has nothing to apologise for.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't believe I have anything to apologise about. In the context of discussing the marches that took place on the weekend, it was the ABC interviewer who pushed the issue, who brought up the issue of anti-Indian migration. What I was doing was highlighting the fact that there is huge concern for Labor's mass migration agenda; which is applying pressure to housing to infrastructure to services. And then I was further pursued on this line of talking. So what I did was point out the fact that, yes, Indian migrants are the second largest migrant group to this country, and soon to be largest migrant group to this country.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator Price went on to cite a poll from RedBridge, saying that around 85 per cent of those who have Indian ancestry in Australia, voted for Labor in the 2022 federal election.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to SBS, Redbridge director Kos Samaras says the Coalition has damaged it's chances with the Indian community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"None of this is going to be good for the Coalition. Well, we have to acknowledge, though, that many Chinese and Indian Australians that arrived in this country, did so under the John Howard policy of skilled migration. This is a pivot, which that government flipped to away from family reunion to skilled migration. And it was certainly on paper, a very clever bit of policy, not only from an economic perspective, because that's where the country was heading in terms of its skilled needs and wants. But also from a cultural perspective, these two communities should have been voting Coalition.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe President of the Council of Indian Australians, Shail Wadhwa, told SBS News, the community deserves an apology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Having this statement by Senator price is really not helping. Actually, it's making the community more divided. So she should be, I think, showing some facts and figures before making such comments which divide the community further.

        "text": "Australia\u2019s economy is growing faster than expected \u2014 a positive sign for the broader economy, but one with potential consequences for mortgage holders.\n\n\n\n\n\nReserve Bank of Australia (RBA) governor Michele Bullock described Wednesday's gross domestic product (GDP) figure as \"positive\" and said \"it's a little stronger than\" the RBA's expectation, adding it might impact the bank's decision on interest rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What it means for the future of interest rates? I don't know at this stage,\" Bullock said during a lecture at the University of Western Australia on Wednesday night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's possible that if it keeps going, then there may not be many interest rate declines left to come, but it all depends.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough some economists believe recent growth could influence interest rates, others argue that this will not change the RBA's plans.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What the RBA's interest rate decision means for your mortgage\n\n'Minor surprise'\n\nGDP has increased by 0.6 per cent over the three months to June 2025 and 1.8 per cent compared to the previous year, according to data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe figure was 0.1 per cent more than the forecast, something AMP chief economist Shane Oliver described as a \"minor surprise\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If it had come at 0.8 or 0.9, then it would be a lot, a lot more significant,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I suppose the surprise was mainly on consumer spending. It was certainly more than expected, but it was partly balanced by pretty soft investment numbers in there.\"\n\n\n\nHow could this impact interest rates?\n\nWhile inflation is considered the key factor in the RBA's interest rate decisions, economic growth can also be a factor.\n\n\n\n\n\nOliver said: \"Normally you cut interest rates to help an economy that is weak. Whereas if the economy is stronger than expected, then it may mean less of a case to cut interest rates.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June, when GDP figures indicated that Australia's economy was slowing, there was speculation about potential interest rate cuts; now, the situation has reversed.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut independent economist Saul Eslake said the difference between the forecast and GDP rate is not \"big enough\" for the RBA to \"alter their plans\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The choice they had was do they cut rates quickly or gradually, and their view was that there's no reason to cut them quickly,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yesterday's data will have reinforced their view that there's no urgency about cutting rates. You can still expect a rate cut in November, but there's no reason to expect one at the next meeting at the end of this month.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEslake predicts there will be two rate cuts in the next six months \u2014 one in November and the other in February 2026.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News In its last meeting in August, the RBA announced a reduction in the cash rate from 3.85 to 3.6 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe RBA board's remaining meetings this year are scheduled for late September and early November and December. It will announce its interest rate decision after each meeting.\n\n\n\n'Material living standards on rise'\n\nWhile there are concerns about how the growth will impact mortgage holders, GDP growth is generally considered good news for the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\nOliver said: \"When you're seeing decent economic growth, it means that material living standards are probably on the rise.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This doesn't necessarily mean people are happier, but at least their material living standards are on the rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whereas when growth is weak, then material living standards might deteriorate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Oliver said the growth might \"slide back\", as the factors that impacted the GDP rise may not be present this quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had the Easter-Anzac Day holiday, which was a period when many people took off as a holiday, and therefore they went and spent more, and we had the start of the new Nintendo Switch [video game console] ... \" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"All those things artificially boosted growth, and that may not be sustained.\"\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the ABS data revealed that household spending grew by 0.9 per cent in the June quarter, following a 0.4 per cent increase in the March quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe increase was mainly because of discretionary spending, which rose 1.4 per cent, whereas essential spending increased by 0.5 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nEslake said that \"the signs for household consumption spending for the moment are encouraging\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said inflation is falling faster than wage growth, and tax cuts that took effect in July and recent interest rate cuts have all impacted this trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are good reasons to think that all of those three trends are gonna continue for a while,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For the moment at least, there's no reason to think that that won't continue gradually to pick up.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The federal government has announced it will pay an additional $475 million to victims of the \"disastrous\" robodebt scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total amount of the deal is now $548.5m, with up to $60m set aside to administer the settlement scheme and up to $13.5m to cover the applicants' reasonable legal costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe settlement, which is subject to approval from the Federal Court, is in addition to the more than $1.8 billion payout handed down in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney-General Michelle Rowland said on Thursday that settling the claim shows the government is doing the right thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today's settlement demonstrates the Albanese Labor government's ongoing commitment to addressing the harms caused to hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Australians by the former Liberal government's disastrous robodebt scheme,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The royal commission described robodebt as a 'crude and cruel mechanism, neither fair nor legal'. It found that 'people were traumatised on the off chance they might owe money' and that robodebt was 'a costly failure of public administration, in both human and economic terms'.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe class action settlement, if approved by the Federal Court, would be the largest in Australia's history.\n\n\n\nBetween 2015 and 2019, the botched debt recovery scheme, set up by the then Coalition government, automatically used tax office data to calculate average earnings and issue debt notices to welfare recipients.\n\n\n\n\n\nRobodebt recovered more than $750 million from almost 400,000 people, but the automated process often failed to accurately reflect people's earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany welfare recipients were falsely accused of owing the government money, and the scheme was linked to several people taking their own lives.\n\n\n\n'Bittersweet' moment for victim\n\nOne of the lead applicants in the robodebt scheme, Felicity Button, has spoken to reporters in Melbourne following the announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm thankful and I am so relieved that it came to this point, but at the same time, there is a bitter sweetness to it thinking of the people that have had irreparable damage happen,\" she said on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People that have lost family members. People that have gone through divorce, become bankrupt. Irreparable mental health issues that have stemmed from this, that will never ... we can never compensate for that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLawyer Peter Gordon, who worked on the case, spoke along with Button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today is a day of vindication and validation for hundreds of thousands of Australians afflicted by the Robodebt scandal. Today, they know that their voices have been heard,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today is also one more vindication of the principle that Australia remains a nation ruled by laws and not by kings \u2014 laws which even hold the government accountable.\"\n\n\n\n",

But instead of bringing relief, the sight of them heightened her fears; not a single woman was among them. Afghan cultural norms, enforced even in emergencies by the ruling Taliban, forbid physical contact between men and women who are not family members. In the village of Andarluckak, in Kunar province, the emergency team hurriedly carried out wounded men and children, and treated their wounds, said Aysha, 19. But she and other women and adolescent girls \u2013 some of them bleeding \u2013 were pushed aside, she said.

Credit: AP \u201cThey gathered us in one corner and forgot about us,\u201d she said. No one offered the women help, asked what they needed or even approached them. Tahzeebullah Muhazeb, a male volunteer who travelled to Mazar Dara, also in Kunar province, said that members of the all-male medical team there were hesitant to pull women out from under the rubble of collapsed buildings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrapped and injured women were left under stones, waiting for women from other villages to reach the site and dig them out. \u201cIt felt like women were invisible,\u201d said Muhazeb, 33. He added, \u201cThe men and children were treated first, but the women were sitting apart, waiting for care.\u201d If no male relative was present, he said, rescue workers dragged dead women out by their clothes so as not to make skin contact. Displaced Afghan women and children gather in Mazar Dara with their belongings on Wednesday. Credit: AP More than 2200 people died and 3600 others were injured in the magnitude 6 quake that flattened countless hamlets and villages, according to figures released by Afghanistan\u2019s government. The response to the quake on Sunday has epitomised the dual standards that women and girls face in Afghanistan, aid groups and humanitarian organisations say, trapped both under the rubble and the weight of gender discrimination. \u201cWomen and girls will again bear the brunt of this disaster, so we must ensure their needs are at the heart of the response and recovery,\u201d the special representative for UN Women Afghanistan, Susan Ferguson, said in a statement this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough the Taliban have not released a gender breakdown of the casualties, women have faced an especially harsh ordeal, made worse by neglect and isolation, more than half a dozen doctors, rescue workers and women in areas hit by the quake said in interviews. Afghanistan faces a critical shortage of healthcare workers and, in particular, of women in that field. Last year, the Taliban imposed a ban on women\u2019s enrolment in medical education. The dearth of female doctors and rescue workers has been all too evident in the wake of the earthquake. Injured Afghan men wait to be treated at a hospital in Jalalabad on Tuesday. Credit: AP Women and girls in Afghanistan face some of the world\u2019s most severe restrictions under the Taliban, who took power four years ago and have remained unflinching, even as most of the Muslim world, countless human rights organisations and bodies like the World Bank have warned against the long-lasting effects of such policies on the country\u2019s social fabric and economy. Girls are prohibited from going to school beyond sixth grade. Women cannot travel far without a male companion and are barred from most jobs, including in nonprofits and humanitarian organisations. Afghan women working for UN agencies have faced repeated harassment, culminating in threats so serious this year that the agencies instructed their female employees to temporarily work from home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Afghanistan, strict cultural and religious norms mean that only a woman\u2019s close male relative \u2013 her father, brother, husband or son \u2013 is permitted to touch her. The same applies in reverse: Women are not allowed to touch men outside their family. In disaster zones, female rescuers are restricted from assisting men. But a woman can pull unrelated women out from under debris. A New York Times journalist who reached the Mazar Dara area the day after the quake didn\u2019t see any women among the medical, rescue or aid teams treating victims. In one district hospital visited, there were no female staff members. When a trickle of nurses and humanitarian workers began reaching the affected areas by Tuesday, only a few were women. Soldiers followed them and prevented journalists from asking questions or photographing them. A spokesperson for the Taliban-run Ministry of Health acknowledged that there was a lack of female health workers in the quake-ravaged areas. \u201cBut in hospitals in Kunar, Nangarhar and Laghman, the largest number of female doctors and nurses are working, especially to treat earthquake victims,\u201d Sharafat Zaman, the spokesperson, said of the worst-hit provinces. Afghanistan is still dealing with aftershocks. On Thursday, one with a magnitude of 5.6 struck.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Championship leader Oscar Piastri is now 34 points ahead of Lando Norris after his teammate\u2019s forced retirement in the closing stages of the Dutch Grand Prix. With a maximum of 249 points on offer to any individual driver in the final nine rounds of the season, Piastri is by no means across the finish line yet. With everything we know from their two seasons together, and what we have learned this year, we take a look at whether Piastri can cruise to victory in the final nine rounds and three sprint races to become the first Australian F1 champion since Alan Jones in 1980, or whether Norris can reel him in. Here\u2019s our race-by-race verdict. Italian Grand Prix\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs was most often the case in 2024, Norris qualified ahead at Monza last year but not by a great deal. Just over a tenth of a second separated the pair. That is very much as it has been in 2025. The race, though, was where Piastri asserted his authority over Norris. He qualified one spot behind but put a bold move on his teammate at the second chicane on the opening lap, taking the lead. On the day, he lost out to Ferrari\u2019s one-stop strategy, but still finished in front of Norris. The high-speed Monza circuit is a track where pushing too hard can lead to a locked brake and losing time that\u2019s difficult to get back in qualifying. Could Norris\u2019s new all-out attack approach hinder him in Italy? Our verdict: Piastri Azerbaijan Grand Prix Looking at their results from the past two seasons, Azerbaijan is one of only two races where Piastri has an advantage in average finishing position. That is largely thanks to his victory there last year, which was more decisive and impressive than his maiden grand prix win in Hungary.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOscar Piastri on the podium after winning the 2024 Azerbaijan Grand Prix. Credit: NurPhoto via Getty Images It is difficult to directly compare Norris\u2019s 2024 performance in Baku to Piastri, given a mistake in qualifying, but surely an imperious win there \u2013 and a bold overtake \u2013 will give the Australian the edge. That said, Norris fought back from 16th on the grid to fourth, and the McLaren car is likely to be strong. Our verdict: Piastri Singapore Grand Prix Whilst it is not universally true, Norris has tended to excel on street circuits. In Singapore last year, his advantage in both qualifying (0.4sec) and the race (first to Piastri\u2019s third) was fairly pronounced, as it was in 2023. Singapore is also a more traditional street circuit, a little closer in style to Monaco, where Norris won in May, than Baku. Given Piastri\u2019s rapid improvement in almost all areas, he should pose more of a threat this year. If Norris can remain error-free in qualifying, then he should go down as favourite at Marina Bay. Our verdict: Norris\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnited States Grand Prix Norris was clearly ahead of Piastri at the Circuit of the Americas last year, with a gap of 0.6 seconds in qualifying. Piastri did not even make it out of the first part of sprint qualifying either, whilst Norris was fourth. It is difficult to see him putting a gap like that on Piastri in 2025, given the Australian\u2019s progress from last season to this. Still, Norris likes this track, and Piastri has struggled. Advantage Norris. Our verdict: Norris Mexico City Grand Prix\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLooking at results from 2023 and 2024, Mexico City is a track where Norris has the largest advantage statistically. That was primarily because Piastri only qualified 17th last season, whilst Norris qualified third before his controversial tussle with Verstappen. Yet in 2023, Norris qualified in 19th but managed to charge through the field to finish ahead of Piastri, who started seventh. It\u2019s fair to say that something has not quite clicked for the Australian in Mexico. Our verdict: Norris Oscar Piastri at the 2024 Mexican Grand Prix. Credit: Getty Images Brazilian Grand Prix Looking at the form book for Sao Paulo is not the most useful because of how wet and chaotic last year\u2019s event was. Again, the Briton holds the better record during the past two years. In two grand prix and two sprint races, Piastri has only scored 11 points to Norris\u2019s 43 in the same period. Yet, that would have been the case at plenty of tracks throughout 2025, too. Look how that has played out. Let\u2019s not forget that Piastri took the sprint pole and was on course to win before moving over and handing victory to his team-mate.\n\nAdvertisement",

In a normal plea, the offender\u2019s lawyers usually call character witnesses to say sure, their client may be a homicidal maniac, but they care for rescue dogs, donate to charity and buy cookies from Girl Guide fundraisers. They then produce a psychiatry report to say their client had a terrible childhood, was brought up by wolves in the jungle and got hit in the head by lightning when they were five. But Patterson\u2019s lawyers couldn\u2019t do that as Erin maintains she is innocent and the victim of such a monstrous injustice not seen since the witch trials in Salem.\n\nOne tactic the defence could have explored would have been to say that while Patterson maintained her innocence, she was prepared to waive an appeal so that her surviving family, including her children, could get on with their lives. That might have got her a three to five-year discount. But that is not in Patterson\u2019s DNA. She is the victim. She asked to have her trial at Morwell then whinged and whined about her cell conditions, no doubt writing a stinging review on Tripadvisor. Erin Patterson arrives at court for her plea hearing. It did not go well. Credit: POOL With yet another complaint, she told a custody officer: \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it is like to suffer.\u201d Everything is relative. Being painfully and deliberately poisoned so that your vital organs shut down is suffering. Not having a fluffy pillow in your watchhouse bunk is more an inconvenience.\n\nWhile she says she is the biggest patsy since Lee Harvey Oswald, her senior barrister, Colin Mandy, SC, took a more sensible route. \u201cThis is very grave offending, and we make no argument that the sentence should be anything other than life imprisonment, but the issue is whether there should be a non-parole period,\u201d he told Beale. Patterson is aged 50 and has already served nearly two years. Mandy wants the judge to set a minimum of 30 years so she could be out when aged about 80. Mandy must surely acknowledge this submission is ambitious. Barrister Colin Mandy, SC, outside court with Erin Patterson\u2019s legal team of Sophie Stafford (left) and Ophelia Hollway. Credit: Jason South In fact, the plea backfired. Out of the blue her team said Patterson was suffering from autism. It would appear to be another Erin self-diagnosis as she didn\u2019t provide a medical diagnosis or even a sick note from a teacher.\n\nOf course, we remember that she used a fake cancer diagnosis to lure her victims to the deadly beef Wellington lunch and so another piece of medical trickery is unlikely to endear her to the judge. To make the point, prosecutor Jane Warren said in court: \u201cThe evidence just isn\u2019t there.\u201d Beale responded, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a lot of credibility ... you\u2019re pushing on an open door.\u201d More appropriately he could have said she has stepped onto a trapdoor. The judge said he had read 28 victim impact statements, affecting four generations of the families, describing it as a tsunami.\n\nProsecutor Warren came off the long run wanting the judge to throw away the key. \u201cIt is a crime that is so cruel and so horrific that, in our submission, the offender is not deserving of this court\u2019s mercy.\u201d Mandy played his strongest cards. Patterson will do jail hard. She will have to be in protection for years, which is solitary confinement. She can chat to her neighbour through some mesh but as that neighbour is a committed, barking-mad terrorist, the dialogue will hardly be witty. Patterson will not see her children grow up and has ruined her life. But she finished three lives and damaged many more. Former husband Simon Patterson told the court how he and his children had been stalked by the media and how they were made to feel as if they were the prize targets in a massive story not of their making.\n\nBeale has listened and acted. After a plea hearing, a judge usually takes months to write their sentencing remarks. In this case, he has broken speed records to be back in court on Monday. Loading He wants this off the books, not for his sake but the sake of the victims in the hope that the searing light of publicity dims \u2013 at least temporarily. Contrary to the view that sentencing judges can be soft or tough, they really have to stay within the lanes with sentencing guidelines and a nod to previous cases. And contrary to public perception, sentencing, at least at the serious end, has become tougher.\n\nIn 1987, Julian Knight murdered seven people and wounded 19 in a mass shooting in Hoddle Street. He received life with a minimum of 27 years. That is about four years per killing with no punishment for the wounding. Loading More astonishing was the fact the prosecutor said there should be a minimum sentence. Decades later, the government stepped in to ban him from parole. Back then, we in the media would get it wrong. The headline would be the main sentence not the minimum that was the real sentence.\n\nOnce inside, an offender would get a further discount for good behaviour. So a murderer who was sentenced to life with a minimum of 21 years would probably serve only 14 and with a few cunning tricks, serve even fewer. Beale has a balancing act. Life with no minimum would likely lead to an appeal on sentence, dragging the case out for another year. If the judge shows mercy, it will not be for Patterson but for the survivors who want this circus ended. If she gets a minimum and appeals, the prosecution could again ask for life potentially extinguishing any chance she will be freed. One case he may look at is that of Ashley Mervyn Coulston who in 1992 went to a house in Burwood to answer an ad for a tenant. He tied up the three people in the house, Kerryn Henstridge, 22, Anne Smerdon, 22, and Peter Dempsey, 27, and executed them.\n\nNo motive was ever established. After trials and retrials, he was finally sentenced to life with Justice Norman O\u2019Bryan saying: \u201cYou have forfeited forever your entitlement to live outside the confines of a prison.\u201d Beale will consider how tough Patterson\u2019s jail time will be. But it is hard to think of a worse crime. Loading She researched methods of murder for months, perhaps years. She decided death cap mushrooms would be the best poison, went out and foraged for the right ones then plotted the crime she believed could be written off as a horrible accident. Although her prime target was ex-husband Simon, she proceeded with the deadly lunch in the hope he would change his mind. When he didn\u2019t, she prepared the deadly beef Wellingtons, served them to her four guests then prayed with them.\n\nShe made small talk watching as they took bite after bite, then watched as Don finished his wife\u2019s leftovers. A hot lunch from the coldest of killers. As soon as they were gone, she headed to the local tip to dump evidence, faked similar symptoms when her guests fell ill, concealed evidence, lied, used her kids as alibi witnesses, and has not once, not ever, shown the slightest sign of remorse. The judge will also know she will not re-offend. No one in their right mind would eat anything she served up after she serves her time. Beale would be well within the law to sentence her to life with no minimum, but if he sets a non-parole period, it will be close to 40 years. The defence would like her eligible for release by the time she is 80. It will be closer to 90, if at all.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size There are two types of music, the old joke goes \u2013 country and western \u2013 and in Australia right now, they\u2019re both riding high. While the last couple of years have seen the live music and festival sector generally struggle, country (the western has long since been put out to pasture) has been experiencing an unprecedented surge in popularity. \u201cCountry music isn\u2019t just growing,\u201d says Kevin Azzopardi, marketing director of ticket reseller Tixel, which has just released its fourth annual State of Play report into the health of the live music sector in Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s booming at the moment.\u201d Tixel\u2019s survey, produced in collaboration with marketing consultancy Bolster, draws on a survey of more than 2700 music fans (not just Tixel customers), as well as industry research and interviews with promoters, managers, and senior label and festival personnel. Young listeners, such as this group of fans at Honky Tonks in Brisbane\u2019s Fortitude Valley, are tuning in to country music like never before. Credit: Markus Ravik And while the overall picture is of a live music industry slowly regaining its footing after a tough few years marked by pandemic shutdowns, cost-of-living pressures, and changing consumer behaviour, in the formerly niche area of country music, everything is coming up roses. Country music fans attend more live events, and spend more at those events \u2013 on food, drink, transport and merchandise \u2013 than fans of other genres. And there\u2019s more of them than ever before.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading \u201cThey spend 57 per cent more than regular consumers,\u201d says Azzopardi. \u201cAnd country music attendance has jumped 54 per cent since 2023. We\u2019re seeing country grow in all areas. We\u2019re seeing it take over socials \u2026 there\u2019s country core, this fashion trend that\u2019s emerging, as well. And so I think there\u2019s a whole cultural phenomenon at the moment around country.\u201d Though as a genre it sits well behind the biggest categories \u2013 pop at 59 per cent of respondents leads the way, with rock (49 per cent) and EDM/electronic (almost 45 per cent) close behind \u2013 country was up from 9 per cent in 2023-24 to 14 per cent in 2024-25. And much of the growth is coming from young people in the capital cities. Bella Bown, a 26-year-old office worker from Bayswater in Melbourne\u2019s outer eastern suburbs, is one such fan. In her early 20s, she says, her taste in music leaned towards house or the kind of pop she heard on commercial radio. Melbourne\u2019s Bella Bown is among a new generation of country music fans. Credit: Wayne Taylor \u201cMy brother was a huge fan of country, but I used to say, \u2018Why do you listen to that?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd then, four or five years ago, I don\u2019t know, something changed.\u201d And what was it about country that hooked her? \u201cIt makes you happy when you\u2019re sad,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it makes you feel a part of something.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBown\u2019s first big concert was Luke Combs in August 2023. \u201cWe were in the mosh pit,\u201d she recalls, \u201cand the vibe just made me fall more in love with country music.\u201d American Combs, who has almost 26 million monthly listeners on Spotify and had three albums in last year\u2019s ARIA top 100 chart, is both contributor to and barometer of the growth of country music in Australia. When he first toured in 2018, he played The Forum in Melbourne and the Enmore in Sydney, in front of a couple of thousand people. By 2023, he was playing Rod Laver in Melbourne (capacity around 14,000) and QUDOS in Sydney (21,000). Last year, he was packing venues three or four times that size. Luke Combs is leading the country crossover into the mainstream. Credit: Wolter Peeters \u201c[A few years ago] you were struggling to fill smaller arenas [with international country artists],\u201d says Dobe Newton, long-standing member of The Bushwhackers and current chair of the Country Music Association of Australia. \u201cAnd then all of a sudden, here\u2019s Luke Combs, the first country artist to not only headline stadiums, but actually sell them out. You know, 320,000 people over six concerts.\u201d Loading In July, the CMAA released its latest census (the last was in 2019). And the story it told was remarkable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2024-25, country music generated revenue of $1.11 billion, a 79 per cent increase on the $619 million reported in 2019. Around half of that spend ($587 million) was from ticket sales. The report claimed 3.26 million people attended country music shows across the year. Crucially, there was no Taylor Swift bump in those numbers, because while country music as a genre is a remarkably broad church, Tay-Tay has excommunicated herself. \u201cShe went to enormous trouble to remove the country signature banjos and fiddles from early recordings,\u201d says Newton, referring to her re-recording of her back catalogue under the \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d rubric. Taylor Swift has worked hard to distance herself from her country music origins. Credit: Invision \u201cThat\u2019s her decision, and I think most people would recognise that she\u2019s not regarding herself \u2013 and therefore most people don\u2019t regard her \u2013 as a country artist. Though now she\u2019s seen the uptick in country, she may produce new versions of those albums with the banjos back in. It would certainly make the next census look pretty damn good.\u201d As country music talent and branding director at Frontier Touring, where she works across the CMC Rocks and Ridin\u2019 Hearts country music festivals, Georgie Luxton has witnessed the explosion in popularity up close. \u201cThere is definitely a new generation of fan,\u201d Luxton says. \u201cI think social media, and especially TikTok, has helped expand people\u2019s view of what country is, the whole breadth of country artists. That platform has really helped give recognition to the genre.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the city-based single-day festival Ridin\u2019 Hearts was launched three years ago, it drew around 3000 people in Melbourne and 4000 in Sydney. This year, they expect to sell between 8000 and 9000 tickets in each city. CMC Rocks \u2013 which turns 20 in 2027 \u2013 will have about 25,000 people onsite in Willowbank in Queensland on each of its three days next March. \u201cThere\u2019s just so many artists coming out at the moment,\u201d Luxton says. \u201cThree or four years ago, we would maybe have been doing like five country tours. Next year, it\u2019s like five festivals, plus at least, I would say, 15 country tours coming through.\u201d Loading The mainstreaming of country owes something to its uptake by some of the world\u2019s biggest pop stars. \u201cYou\u2019ve got Beyonce crossing genres [with her Cowboy Carter album], you\u2019ve got Chappell Roan releasing country singles, you\u2019ve got Post Malone doing collaborations with Taylor Swift,\u201d notes Azzopardi. But country is taking hold at a grassroots level too \u2013 with rodeos, line-dancing classes and country-themed club nights spreading like wildfire. There\u2019s even been the emergence of a cosmic-country/ambient Americana strand in electronic music. \u201cIt really has exploded,\u201d says Luxton. But for every inner-city hipster lining up for a boot-scooting session in Melbourne\u2019s Brunswick or dropping an ironic yee-har at Jolene\u2019s in the Sydney CBD, there are those who prefer to take their country straight, no chaser. Country music fan Ash Thorpe: \u201cWhen you come down to it, it\u2019s three chords and the truth.\u201d Credit: Louise Kennerley\n\nAdvertisement",

NFL hopeful who blew Viking horn in Vegas sacked and suspended\n\nThe NFL wannabe who was kicked out of Allegiant Stadium shortly after blowing the Viking horn has been cut by the Las Vegas Raiders and suspended for two games. Tyler Manoa, a 25-year-old defensive tackle, was given the honour of blowing a custom-made horn that was constructed solely for the purposes of marking Canberra\u2019s debut in the United States in the opening round of the season. Tyler Manoa may have jeopardised his NFL career moments after blowing the Viking horn. Credit: Fox Sports Canberra had reached out to a number of celebrities - including Dana White, Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and Las Vegas Raiders head coach Pete Carroll - in the hope they would be available. When they all declined, Manoa - who is yet to make his run-on NFL debut - was enlisted for the job. Shortly after blowing the horn, Manoa was ejected from the stadium for misbehaviour in the corporate area. Then a member of the Las Vegas Raiders\u2019 practice squad, it\u2019s alleged Manoa damaged property inside the restrooms, with some reports suggesting he was also tasered.\n\nManoa was scheduled to make a guest appearance in the Canberra sheds after their win against the New Zealand Warriors, but was a no-show. With the NFL season just a month away, the Raiders have cut Manoa, making him a free agent. However, it\u2019s been reported that he will cop a two-game NFL suspension, said to be linked to the Allegiant Stadium incident, that could be a turn-off for prospective employers.The NFL announced on Sunday (AEST) that Manoa had been suspended due to \u201cconduct detrimental to the league\u201d. Canberra\u2019s stellar performance in Las Vegas has been the springboard to a dominant season in which they claimed their first minor premiership since 1990.

        "text": "Queensland Maroons skipper Cameron Munster has achieved everything rugby league has to offer, but even he is on edge for what Reece Walsh could produce once the NRL finals launch.\n\nThe Brisbane Broncos\u2019 fullback produced what his halfback Ben Hunt defined as \u201chis most controlled game for a while\u201d to orchestrate a 30-14 boilover of Melbourne on Thursday night, all but sealing their place in the top four.\n\nMunster was forced to watch as Walsh triggered everything: scoring twice \u2013 his second coming straight after his own 40/20 \u2013 and setting up another in a career-best 22 point haul.\n\nOn and off the field, Walsh is never far from a headline. His now infamous social media video drinking from a toilet appeared an unnecessary distraction in the lead up to the crucial clash, while he has been both lauded and criticised for his audacious play.",

Picture: NewsWire / John Appleyard\n\n\u201cBut, the reality is, from 2022 we\u2019ve had Auditor-General reports about these programs, and there was a lot of looseness in the programs \u2026 and they did have to be tightened up after that.\u201d\n\nMs Saffin said she wanted anyone who applied for a recovery grant to \u201cget it as quick as I can possibly get it\u201d, but not all applicants had the required information and were required to \u201cgo back and do it again\u201d.\n\nAsked about the wrapping up of Recovery Co-ordinator for the Hunter and Mid North Coast Dave Owens after 103 days in the role, Ms Saffin said \u201cit was time-limited\u201d.\n\n\u201cRecovery co-ordinators come in for a certain amount of time to be on the ground, the eyes and ears,\u201d Ms Saffin said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIt was only to be three months, and I think it might be extended by a couple of weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not their role to actually clean it up, it\u2019s his role to be there to make sure it happens\u201d.\n\nMs Saffin admitted the recovery was \u201clong and complex\u201d, but \u201cwe\u2019re not going to have the recovery co-ordinator there forever\u201d.\n\nThe state government has faced pressure over its handling of grants after the NSW Mid North Coast floods. Picture: NewsWire Handout/ Transport NSW\n\nThe hearing was told the recovery co-ordinator role was \u201cnot gone\u201d and instead had transitioned over to an employee of the reconstruction authority.\n\nMr Owens was appointed recovery co-ordinator on May 29 but quietly wrapped up his role on Tuesday, according to The Daily Telegraph.\n\nNSW Nationals leader Dugald Saunders said the scaling back of the recovery co-ordinator role only added \u201cinsult to injury\u201d, with work left to do.\n\nHe claimed businesses were \u201cwondering how and why they should keep going after waiting for over three months and clearly being let down\u201d.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t expect people to hang by a thread for that amount of time and it once again feels like our regional communities are being punished,\u201d he said.\n\nNationals Myall Lakes MP Tanya Thompson said decisions about funding \u201cmake or break people\u2019s lives\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe stroke of a pen is affecting whether people can open their doors or shut up shop forever,\u201d she said.",
