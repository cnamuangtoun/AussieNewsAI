(ABC Rural: Lucy Thackray)\n\nLand tax is a New South Wales levy usually applied to properties that are not the owner's primary place of residence.\n\nProperty used for primary production is exempt from the tax, but a recent decision by the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal (NCAT) has shifted the goalposts for some farmers.\n\nNCAT ruled that where wine sales generated more revenue than grape sales, the predominant purpose shifted from primary production (grape cultivation) to manufacturing (wine production), disqualifying the property from the land tax exemption.\n\nA winery's classification depends on whether it makes more money selling wine or grapes. (ABC News)\n\nStatewide impact\n\nWineries across regions such as Mudgee, the Hunter and the Central West have been investing in agritourism, encouraged by the Destination NSW Tourism Strategy.\n\nNSW Wine chief executive Matthew Jessop said the reinterpretation of land tax rules \"runs counter to all other government policy\".\n\n\"It puts NSW at odds with all the other states, it certainly puts our farmers and grape growers at a big disadvantage,\" he said.\n\nSome winemakers have claimed the reinterpretation puts NSW winemakers at a \"significant disadvantage\". (Stateline )\n\n\"Destination NSW and the Minister for Tourism, one of their strategic pillars is diversified agritourism businesses, because they know they create jobs and they create vibrant regional businesses.\"\n\nRevenue NSW has denied any reinterpretation of the Primary Production Land tax exemption.\n\nIn a statement to the ABC, a spokesperson said no legislative changes relevant to the exemption had been made in 20 years.\n\n\"Rural land is exempt from land tax if the dominant use of the land is for a primary production purpose,\" they said.\n\n\"If a business owner, such as a wine grower, offers other products or services, such as a cellar door or restaurant, whether an exemption applies will depend on whether primary production is the dominant use of the land.\"\n\nNSW Small Business Minister Janelle Saffin said it sounded as though wineries had diversified into other business areas.\n\n\"It also sounds like the primary producers' grant \u2014 if you get over 50 per cent of your income off farm, then you're not eligible for certain things and it's in that same category,\" she said.\n\n\"A lot of people diversify within their industry, and it depends where they get it.\"\n\nMs Saffin said she would \"look into\" the situation.",

        "text": "There are calls for more dredging work at the embattled Port Hinchinbrook marina in north Queensland, despite the latest project failing to improve accessibility.\n\nExacerbated by natural disasters and red tape, mud and silt have choked the channel originally dug in the 1990s to provide access to the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nSmall businesses and the fishing industry in nearby Cardwell fear the situation is getting worse, as visitor and boat numbers continue to fall.\n\nBut conservationists say dredging is expensive, has not worked, and threatens endangered dugongs that feed in the area.\n\nDigging for answers\n\nIn 2024, Cassowary Coast Regional Council acquired a licence to dredge up to 1,000 tonnes of mud and silt from the main canal, funded by a $1.5 million grant from the federal government.\n\nThat project was completed in January 2025, but by February, major flooding once again filled the port with debris.\n\n\"We undertook some flood debris clean-up, so that was actually separate to the dredging. The clean-up was completed in April,\" Mayor Teresa Millwood said.\n\nRalph Cremer says the mud is \"very destructive\" to vessels. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\nBut Ralph Cremer, a senior advisor with boat servicing business Port Hinchinbrook Marine, said the build-up of mud made the channel shallow and dangerous.\n\n\"At low tide, it's just full mud. You can't even move a boat on it, so it is very, very destructive to vessels,\" he said.\n\n\"Missing high tide if [fishermen] are in the channel, they can sit on the mud and go nowhere.\n\n\"If they're out in the ocean, they'll just have to wait until the tide comes back up so they can come in.\"\n\nBoat moorings remain empty in the marina at Port Hinchinbrook. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\nHe said that made it unattractive for commercial operators, and as a result, the number of vessels in the shipyard had halved since Cyclone Yasi devastated the area in 2011.\n\n\"All the skippers or the owners of the vessels seem to lose the appetite to come to Port Hinchinbrook, either to the marina or the marine area itself,\" Mr Cremer said.\n\n\"It's just not commercial anymore to come into this channel.\"\n\nChris Mackay says the recent work has not improved safety. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\nThe council's project was well short of the $20 million a 2023 feasibility study estimated it would cost for a long-term dredging and maintenance plan.\n\nCardwell recreational fisherman Chris Mackay said he was concerned it had not improved safety.\n\n\"There's that much debris in the water or in the mud that you, you got to be clearing the mud with your propeller,\" he said.\n\nMario Dimauro, also a keen recreational fisherman, moved to Cardwell five years ago.\n\nMario Dimauro says the state of Port Hinchinbrook has worsened since he moved to Cardwell. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\nHe agreed access had worsened.\n\n\"When I first came here, 0.9 [metre] tide, you could get back in, now it's 1.8,\" Mr Dimauro said.\n\n\"It needs a total dredge out from the mouth back and then maintenance all the time.\n\n\" You can't just dredge it, cause it'll just fill in again. It's got to be maintained periodically. \"\n\nDeeper solutions\n\nRetired engineer and local environmentalist John Mewing said dredging was not the solution.\n\nJohn Mewing says the ongoing dredging of Port Hinchinbrook is prohibitively expensive. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\nHe said the recent project was not productive.\n\n\"What they've done there is going to refill with sediment, in a relatively short space of time,\" he said.\n\n\" We're going to be back to square one again. \"\n\nHe said the Hinchinbrook channel had high siltation rates, meaning as water flowed in and out, it naturally dropped large amounts of sediment, making it \"prohibitively expensive\" to maintain.\n\nVessels are unable to get in and out of the water for most of the day from Port Hinchinbrook. (ABC Far North: Sophie Johnson)\n\nEnvironmentalist Kenn Parker opposed the original dredge that made way for the development in the 1990s, which he said threatened endangered dugongs.\n\n\"Their feed areas along the western side of the channel, the seagrass beds have mostly disappeared \u2026 because of the release of the material from the spoil ponds,\" he said.\n\nHe said fewer boats in the area also made it a safer habitat for the animals.\n\nIn its first budget in June, the new LNP state government announced it was allocating funding \"to enable delivery of options for the ongoing sustainable use of the port\" but did not disclose how much it would spend.\n\nKatter's Australian Party member for Hinchinbrook Nick Dametto said he was working with all levels of government for a long-term solution to the situation.\n\nHe said it was complicated by the legal status of the property, which made it unattractive to potential investors.\n\nNick Dametto and then-premier Steven Miles survey the silted waterway at the Port Hinchinbrook development in 2024. (Supplied)\n\n\"It was written in such a way where the developer basically became responsible for every single thing \u2026 the dredging, the roads, the sewerage,\" he said.\n\n\"A developer has not got the ability to rate and charge for any of those services.\n\n\"The way to solve the problem moving forward \u2026 [is] to replace parts of the development with a basic infrastructure agreement, for example, a long-term dredging plan.\"",

(ABC South West WA: Anthony Pancia)\n\nThe scheme is funded by beverage producers, with suppliers paying about 15 cents per container to cover the cost of refunds and operating the scheme.\n\nThe ABC has spoken to several breweries involved in the scheme which said there were significant additional costs associated with printing new labels, administration and compliance.\n\nAdministrative 'burden'\n\nMore than 25 million bottles of Margaret River wine are sold around Australia each year.\n\nMultiplied by 13.84 cents per glass container, excluding GST, the ABC has calculated the local industry would pay at least $3.46 million per year directly to the scheme.\n\nMargaret River Wine Association chief executive Amanda Whiteland said the real cost could be a lot higher.\n\n\"When you add in all the administrative costs of executing the scheme, as it's currently unique in every state, it could be up to $1 a bottle \u2026 that could be up to $25 million it could cost the industry a year,\" she said.\n\nAmanda Whiteland says it could cost the local industry millions a year to comply.

        "text": "ANZ bank faces a record $240 million penalty for engaging in \"unconscionable conduct\" in some of its bond trading for the federal government, as well as \"widespread misconduct\" affecting nearly 65,000 retail customers.\n\nThe bank has agreed to the penalty with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), although it will require Federal Court approval.\n\n\"Time and time again, ANZ has fallen short,\" ASIC's chair Joe Longo told a press conference on Monday.\n\n\"Time and time again, ANZ has betrayed the trust of Australians.\n\n\"Today many Australians will rightly be questioning their trust in ANZ.\"\n\nThe settlement includes $125 million over a specific trade in Australian government bonds on 19 April 2023, where ANZ was helping the country's sovereign debt management agency deliver $14 billion in bonds.\n\nASIC said where the bank misreported trading data and acted \"unconscionably\", and its actions had the potential to reduce the amount of funding available to the government.\n\n\"'We have looked very closely at what happened on the day,\" ANZ chair Paul O'Sullivan told an investor briefing about that trade this morning.\n\n\" We breached some of our license obligations. \"\n\nASIC said that ANZ sold a large chunk of 10-year bond futures around the time the bond issue was priced, which placed downward pressure on bond prices and could have resulted in a shortfall in the bond sale.\n\nASIC said that, when the government later asked what had happened, the bank's answers were misleading or deceptive.\n\nANZ said that ASIC has not alleged it engaged in market manipulation or over-hedging.\n\nThe bank said all trading undertaken by ANZ as duration manager was to hedge the risk borne by it in connection with its role on this transaction.\n\nANZ claims that no loss was caused to the Commonwealth from its trading as duration manager.\n\nANZ is also alleged to have overstated its bond trading turnover for nearly two years, which may have resulted in it winning more appointments as the lead for future bond issues.\n\n\"We have apologised to the AOFM [Australian Office of Financial Management] for the inadequate communication on this transaction and offered to pay the AOFM the revenue ANZ earned as duration manager,\" Mr O'Sullivan in a statement.\n\n\" The board has driven comprehensive accountability reviews in relation to the markets issues, which have resulted in significant reductions in remuneration for certain current and former executives. \"\n\nMr O'Sullivan told the investor briefing on Monday morning that it believes the bonds matter was now dealt with.\n\n\"We do believe today that this draws a line under those issues and lets us move forward,\" he said.\n\nNearly 30,000 customers underpaid savings interest\n\nThe regulator said $115 million of the proposed penalty relates to customer failings.\n\nANZ failed to respond to 488 customer hardship notices, in some cases for more than two years.\n\nASIC said that the reasons for the hardship applications included unemployment, serious health issues, bereavement and family violence.\n\nIn some cases, ANZ undertook debt collection activities, including issuing default notices and bringing in external debt collection agencies, despite not having responded to the customer's hardship application.\n\nSeparately, ANZ made false and misleading statements about some of its savings rates, failing to pay the promised introductory bonus interest rate to tens of thousands of customers.\n\nANZ had already compensated nearly 200,000 customers affected by this between July 2013 and January 2024, however ANZ is now remediating another 29,917 customers who were underpaid interest for similar reasons between August 2024 and March 2025.\n\nThe bank also failed to refund fees to thousands of dead customers and was slow in responding to loved ones trying to manage deceased estates.\n\nAs with the incorrect savings rates, ASIC said this was due to inadequate systems and processes that could not identify which fees should be waived or refunded, not whether any fees had already been waived or refunded.\n\nASIC said ANZ had already been penalised seven times in the past eight years for prior misconduct.\n\nANZ bosses say sorry\n\nANZ chair Paul O'Sullivan acknowledged the bank had \"made mistakes that have had a significant impact on customers\".\n\n\" On behalf of ANZ, I apologise and assure our customers we have taken the necessary action, including holding relevant executives accountable. \"\n\nLast week, ANZ's new chief executive Nuno Matos, who has only been in the role for a matter of months, announced the bank would be cutting 3,500 staff and around 1,000 contractor positions over the next year.\n\n\"The failings outlined are simply not good enough and they reinforce the case for change,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we see measurable improvements across the bank to better protect and care for our customers and to create a more sustainable business.\"",

(ABC News: Lily Kristanto)\n\n\"At this stage we feel it's best with this training to focus on the 10 and up.\"\n\nBut the rules differ in each jurisdiction.\n\nIn Queensland, GPs are allowed to diagnose and prescribe ADHD medication for children as young as 4.\n\nNew South Wales, South Australia and the ACT will also train doctors to diagnose and treat the condition in children, but haven't specified at what age.\n\nIn Tasmania, more GPs and paediatricians are being recruited to deal with long waitlists.\n\nThousands on public waitlist\n\nThrough WA's public health system, psychologists can diagnose children with ADHD, and paediatricians are able to diagnose and prescribe ADHD medication for children.\n\nAyla was not given a wait time, but there are more than 12,000 children on WA's public waitlist to see a paediatrician for a range of conditions.\n\nMs Jackson said it affects a lot more than just the children.\n\nSarah Jackson says the long waiting lists to see health professionals is having a big impact on society. (ABC News)\n\n\"I know that there are families out there who are really struggling, who are on that wait list who aren't getting supported and they've had to quit their job,\" Ms Jackson said.\n\n\"Some of them, they just need help now, it's absolutely shocking.\"\n\n\" It's underestimated, the impact that that wait list is having on our society.

        "text": "A Murujuga traditional custodian is threatening legal action against the federal government, after it approved the extension of Australia's biggest gas project, Woodside's North West Shelf, until 2070.\n\nOn Friday, Environment Minister Murray Watt granted the project final approval, almost four months after he gave Woodside 10 days to respond to his provisional approval for the extension.\n\nThe approval is subject to 48 strict conditions, including reducing certain gas emissions by 2030, aimed at protecting nearby ancient Indigenous rock art.\n\nThe life of the North West Shelf gas project has been extended for another 40 years. (ABC News: Charlie Mclean)\n\nMardathoonera woman and Murujuga traditional custodian Raelene Cooper described the approval as a \"betrayal\" to Aboriginal people.\n\n\"I have already instructed my lawyers to put the Minister on notice that this decision may have breached his statutory duties and international legal obligations,\" she said.\n\nShe said the conditions placed on the project were no better than those that already existed.\n\nMr Watt said on Friday the 48 conditions would \"avoid and mitigate\" significant impacts to the ancient Murujuga rock art in the region, which is adjacent to the gas plant.\n\nCan Australia be both a gas giant and a climate leader? Photo shows Two flares from a tower light up the night sky. Seven years after it was first mooted, the extension of Australia's biggest gas project could not have landed at a more critical juncture for the nation's climate credentials.\n\nBut Ms Cooper said the conditions did not go far enough.\n\n\"There could be 100 [conditions] from our West Australian and Australian government \u2026 I can tell you very confidently those [conditions] aren't nearly enough,\" she said.\n\nThe Murujuga site contains the world's largest collection of ancient rock art. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)\n\nMs Cooper said Mr Watt's decision to exempt all \"industrial gaseous emissions\" was offensive and would allow industry to continue damaging the rock art.\n\n\"This was not a recommendation from the department, or the independent expert report, or part of the initial UNESCO World Heritage recommendations the government lobbied against.\n\n\" \u2026 If there is no damage occurring, why is this exemption required? \"\n\nMs Cooper has spent years fighting for the protection of the rock art in northern WA and in 2022 lodged an application under the Aboriginal Heritage Protection Act (AHPA) over fears three nearby industrial projects, including the North West Shelf, were accelerating the degradation of the World Heritage-listed rock art.\n\nMs Cooper said the federal government's North West Shelf extension approval was a betrayal of Aboriginal people, elders and all Australians.\n\nHave something to share with the ABC's WA newsroom?

        "text": "Fortunes can change very quickly in the AFLW.\n\nAfter Geelong lost their opening two games, senior coach Dan Lowther said it was well publicised in the short 12-round season that early wins were important, but \"who's to say we can't win the next 10?\".\n\nThat was pretty quickly proven not possible when the Cats went down to Sydney the following week by less than a goal.\n\nBut Lowther's argument was strengthened this weekend when his side claimed its second consecutive win, a 30-point hammering over Richmond, rocketing it up the ladder to 10th spot, just outside the top eight and equal on points with reigning grand finalist Brisbane.\n\nGeorgie Prespakis has been a key part of the Cats' consecutive wins. (Getty: Kelly Defina)\n\nThe fixture structure \u2014 where ladder positions from the previous year dictate the difficulty of clubs' run \u2014 can deceive how well teams are placed after just a few rounds.\n\nThis was highlighted by commentator Abbey Holmes, who said Geelong \"have a tough start\".\n\n\"But it does seem like they are starting to find their groove,\" Holmes said on Seven.\n\nOne of the keys to those consecutive wins was the performance of midfield star Georgie Prespakis.\n\n\"Just her ability to link up. Mikayla Bowen's having an unbelievable year as well but just the one-two efforts, the third efforts, the fourth efforts, she never stops running, never stops competing,\" Holmes said.\n\n\"[She] had 31 disposals, 413 metres gained, six clearances \u2014 and it's a very big reason as to why the Cats have got consecutive wins on the board now.\"\n\nNorth Melbourne are the only side left undefeated in the AFLW after round five. (Getty: Michael Willson/AFL Photos)\n\nAfter the weekend of upsets, the only team left undefeated are, fairly unsurprisingly, reigning premiers North Melbourne.\n\nThey became the first defending premiers to win a grand final rematch in the history of the competition. In toppling Brisbane, they extended their 17-match, 651-day winning streak.\n\nThe result puts the Lions, the second-most-successful team in the history of the competition, behind Adelaide, outside the eight in ninth position.\n\n\"This isn't the Brisbane Lions that we know. Who's hungry? Who wants the footy? Who wants to put their head over it and win a contested ball?\" Holmes asked on Fox during the third quarter.\n\n\"It's something that has made them such a dominant side in this competition for a long period of time and it seems to be lacking.\"\n\nInaugural Blue hopes for finals berth after hot start Photo shows Carlton players celebrate during a match against Gold Coast. Inaugural Carlton player Gab Pound says the club has reached a turning point after not making the finals since the 2020 COVID-interrupted season.\n\nAt the same time, Adelaide, who had just the two wins under their belt coming into the weekend, defeated the previously undefeated Hawthorn.\n\nThe Crows did not just run out the victory, but did so by 21 points.\n\nCommentator Jessica Webster told Fox it was a \"reminder that the Crows are still a contender\" despite a patchy start to the year.\n\nMelbourne, who were also undefeated ahead of the round, fell to Port Adelaide by a mere two points.\n\nSimilar to Geelong, St Kilda headed into the weekend with just the one win but had a comprehensive 52-point win over Essendon spearheaded by goalscorer Jesse Wardlaw.\n\nThat victory saw them climb to 12th, just ahead of Collingwood, who had a surprise win over previously undefeated Sydney to begin the round.\n\nThe other NSW side, GWS, however, broke a 378-day winning drought when they secured a 21-point over the Western Bulldogs after Georgia Garnett starred with three goals.\n\nIt leaves just Richmond yet without a win this year.\n\nTo close out the round over in the West, Fremantle (14th) denied West Coast (seventh) a first derby win to take their tally over their rivals to 7-0.\n\nIt was a game the Dockers came into on a three-game losing run, while the Eagles had only dropped one game all season.",

        "text": "The Miran appointment, while certain to be rubber-stamped by the Republican majority in the Senate, is controversial because he has said he won\u2019t resign from his role as chair of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, instead taking an unpaid leave of absence. Miran was nominated to fill the remaining term of former governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned last month, even though her term wasn\u2019t scheduled to end until January 31 next year. It is unclear if he will remain on the board beyond that date. Trump is still trying to fire Cook on the basis of an allegation made on social media that hasn\u2019t been proven and now appears to have been disproved. Credit: AP By remaining a key Trump adviser while serving as a governor, Miran, regarded as the architect of the administration\u2019s more contentious economic policies \u2013 including the tariffs and Trump\u2019s efforts to bring the Fed under the administration\u2019s control \u2013 would not be an independent in an institution that Congress designed to be independent of politics. Unlike Waller or Bowman, appointed by Trump but not part of the administration (although Waller is on the short list to be the next Fed chair and therefore wouldn\u2019t want to be offside with Trump), he\u2019d clearly be Trump\u2019s main man inside the Fed.\n\nThe Cook affair is also tainted. Trump purported to fire her last month, via a social media post, after the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, alleged (in a social media post, of course) that she had named two separate properties as her principal place of residence in loan documents, which may have enabled her to borrow more cheaply. Loading She\u2019s not been charged with anything and can only be sacked \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is generally thought to mean that the official has done something seriously wrong while in office. The initial judgment that the administration is appealing was that Trump\u2019s justification for firing Cooke didn\u2019t meet the threshold for sufficient cause, in part because the alleged actions occurred before she was a governor. As it happens, what Pulte and Trump have alleged may not even have occurred.\n\nFirst Reuters, and then a string of major media outlets, have said Cook described her second property as \u201ca vacation home,\u201d not as her principal place of residence, in loan documents they have seen. Cook\u2019s lawyers have said any errors in the loan documents, if there were errors, were unintentional and might be the results of clerical errors. If the documents Reuters and others have sighted \u2013 which appear to be loan estimates provided by a credit union \u2013 exist then, regardless of what the final loan documents showed, the lender would have been aware that the loan was for a holiday home, not as her primary residence. In other words, Trump is still trying to fire Cook on the basis of an allegation made on social media that hasn\u2019t been proven and now appears to have been disproved. The allegations are a pretext to try to open another spot on the Fed board for a Trump appointee. If Trump can gain a majority of the seven-person board, he would then be in a position to remake the FOMC, where the remaining members are the president of the New York Fed and the presidents of four of the Fed\u2019s 12 regional banks, who serve on a rotating basis. The Fed\u2019s board can veto those appointments.\n\nThe White House, with a president who has said he wants the federal funds rate cut by three percentage points, would be able to dictate US monetary policy, ending three quarters of a century of the US central bank\u2019s independence. When the Fed last met, in July, for the first time in more than 30 years there were two governors \u2013 Waller and Bowman \u2013 who dissented from the majority\u2019s decision to hold rates steady. The interest this week will be in whether Miran, Waller and Bowman, argue for something more than the 25 basis points cut expected. The majority is likely to be conservative \u2013 there could be some who argue for rates to remain on hold \u2013 because, while the jobs market appears to be shrinking and the unemployment rate is rising, the full effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs are yet to show up in the data. That\u2019s because of the on-off-on way they were implemented, which allowed companies to build up inventories of goods before the tariffs took effect. With the main \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs finally going live last month, their impact on prices will progressively show up over the rest of this year and beyond. The worst-case outlook for the Fed is one of stagflation: low economic growth, or even a recession, while the inflation rate remains high. Trump\u2019s trade wars and his immigration policies make it possible that there could be, simultaneously, rising unemployment and rising inflation.",

The system, whatever they are doing to get it better, there\u2019s no consistency and it\u2019s not working.\u201d Rounding out the strange day, the Wallabies - the losing team who been caned 14-7 and had every right to pour fuel on the same bonfire - then came in and bit their tongues. Referee Christophe Ridley gestures to Harry Wilson. Credit: Getty Images Showing his years of experience, Joe Schmidt rattled off half-a-dozen things he\u2019d observed but surmised they couldn\u2019t worry about it. It was the wise approach, for a bunch of reasons. Referees are like elephants, and you\u2019ll get them again.\n\nBut it\u2019s fair to say the referee and the match officials, to put it mildly, had a rough day. Ridley is an inexperienced young Test referee and, as can occur, his attempts to stamp authority early on for minor stuff set in motion a game that may have got away from him. He then didn\u2019t stay consistent, which irked the captains, and when new penalties in key moments were found from areas he\u2019d previously ignored - like high shots and obstruction by retreating defenders - the captains\u2019 grumbles spread out and into a very restless home crowd. Santiago Carreras kicks a goal for Argentina. Credit: Getty Images In many ways, it made for brilliant theatre. With a record crowd (post-rebuild), the joint was absolutely rocking. Nothing brings people together more than booing a referee whose calls they don\u2019t agree with. In the end, all the match officials were so rattled they were the only four people in the stadium who missed, or cleared, a blatant forward pass. Even Wallabies players had their hands on their heads, missed-soccer-goal style.\n\nThe game ended in a loss for the Wallabies but oddly enough, the crackling atmosphere was arguably one of the best in years, possibly decades. With unprecedented numbers of people in generations of gold jerseys, old and new, and with lots of kids in the stands, the sense of injustice only served to unite - and amplify - the support. Loading Pubs and restaurants around Paddington and Surry Hills did a roaring trade of post-game analysis. And, also encouragingly, most Aussie fans agreed the end result was the right one. For all the harsh calls on the Wallabies, the Pumas had still been the better side on the day; hungrier and cleaner in most contests, and certainly more physical. The Wallabies mostly had themselves to blame. After getting that dangerous taste of space early - Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii\u2019s fifth-minute try came after the Wallabies had gone backwards with their carrying - the home team then frantically chased even more quick kills.\n\nWallabies players spoke post-game about the need to fix up their discipline, having gone from 10 Tests in two Tests in South Africa to 25 in two clashes with Argentina. And patience and belief in teammates is usually the antidote to cutting penalty counts. But patience also the key to being more clinical, a bit more boring and winning a game like the one at Allianz Stadium. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really efficient off our line breaks, but probably the last two weeks we\u2019ve tried to score off those line breaks as opposed to the patience of,\u201d Tate McDermott said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to weigh up whether the risk is actually worth the reward there.\u201d For all the Australian fury at the referee team, the takeaway for the Wallabies is Contepomi was fuming too. Short of World Rugby doing the logical thing and using top Test referees for all top Tests, no matter their nationality (Angus Gardner was wasted as a touch judge in Wellington, for example), rookie refs will inevitably be inconsistent as they build experience.",

        "text": "ANZ has issued an apology to customers after the financial regulator found the bank had committed a string of offences, including failing to refund fees charged to dead customers, not responding to customer hardship notices and failing to pay promised interest rates to thousands of people.\n\n\n\n\n\nANZ now faces a record fine of $80 million for unconscionable conduct in its dealings with the federal government while it was managing a $14 billion bond deal , along with a further $125 million for institutional and markets matters and $115 million in penalties for retail misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial watchdog the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) announced on Monday that ANZ had admitted to misconduct over many years, and ASIC chair Joe Longo said the bank had again \"betrayed the trust of Australians\".\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO ANZ slashes 3,500 jobs, are there more to come? SBS News 13:19 English\n\nASIC outlined ANZ's wrongdoings as:\n\n\n\nIncorrectly reporting its bond trading data to the federal government and overstating the volumes by tens of billions of dollars\n\nFailing to respond to hundreds of customer hardship notices\n\nMaking false and misleading statements about its savings interest rates\n\nFailing to refund fees charged to thousands of dead customers.\n\nFailures with financial hardship, interest and deceased estates\n\nASIC alleged a number of failures in ANZ's treatment of customers, including failure to respond to 488 customers who submitted financial hardship notices to the bank between May 2022 and September 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nIssues of unemployment, serious medical issues, bereavement and family violence were ignored, and in some cases, ASIC alleges ANZ took action to recover debts from customers even when they had not responded to the customers' hardship notices.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank has now paid out a total of $92,687 to affected customers through a remediation program.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver 11 years, the introductory bonus interest for ANZ customers who opened certain new accounts was not always applied. The bank also gave inaccurate variable and fixed bonus introductory interest rates to 26,917 customers, resulting in around $480,000 in interest not paid out.\n\n\n\nASIC also alleges ANZ failed to refund fees charged to thousands of deceased customers between July 2019 and June 2023 and did not respond to representatives of deceased estates in the required time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe watchdog said the extent of this issue is still unknown and \"ANZ's failures are likely to have compounded the difficulties faced by loved ones dealing with the death of a family member or relative\".\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2023 inquiry report by the independent Banking Code Compliance Committee (BCCC) focused on six banks, including the 'big four' \u2014 Commonwealth, ANZ, Westpac and NAB \u2014 and found the banking industry does a poor job of handling deceased estates. This included charging fees for services no longer provided and failing to treat next of kin with respect and kindness.\n\n\n\n\n\nANZ was sanctioned in July last year by the BCCC for charging fees to the estates of dead clients.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Lifting caps from first home buyer scheme will help some but fuel wider price rise\n\nThe committee's chair Ian Govey called the deficiencies in ANZ's compliance \"deeply concerning\" at the time and said publicly naming the bank for its failures was the most serious sanction the industry overseer could levy.\n\n\n\nRecord fine\n\nASIC said that, alongside ANZ, it will ask the Federal Court to impose $240 million in penalties, including a record $80 million penalty for its misconduct.\n\n\n\n\n\nLongo said the proposed penalties against ANZ are the largest announced by the regulator against one entity and \"reflect the seriousness and number of breaches of law\" as well as the \"vulnerable position\" the bank put its customers in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Banks must have the trust of customers and government. This outcome shows an unacceptable disregard for that trust that is critical to the banking system,\" he said.\n\n\n\nANZ chairman Paul O'Sullivan apologised for the bank's misconduct and said it had \"made mistakes that have had a significant impact on our customers\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While ASIC has not alleged that ANZ engaged in market manipulation, it's clear we have not met the standards expected of us,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank also confirmed that it will submit a remediation plan required by ASIC to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority by the end of the month and said it expects to spend approximately $150 million on implementing the plan.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Using your phone on the toilet won't just leave it covered in germs, it could also lead to an increased risk of haemorrhoids, according to a study from the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study surveyed 125 adults and found that those who reported using a phone on the throne had a higher risk of haemorrhoids than non-users.\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants were asked how often they used their phones while on the toilet, and for how long.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey found 66 per cent of all participants used smartphones while on the toilet, with that group spending \"significantly more time there\" \u2014 often more than five minutes per visit \u2014 compared with those who didn't.\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking the news and using social media were the most common smartphone toilet activities, according to the study, which was published in scientific journal PLOS ONE in early September.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Loo scrolling: Study investigates link between this bathroom habit and a painful health condition SBS News 07:07 English\n\nThe researchers suggest that smartphone use may inadvertently prolong toilet time, potentially increasing pressure in anal tissues, which may then lead to haemorrhoids.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter accounting for other factors linked with haemorrhoid risk \u2014 including exercise habits, age and fibre intake \u2014 the researchers found that those who scrolled on the toilet had a 46 per cent higher risk of haemorrhoids than those who didn't.\n\n\n\nWhat are haemorrhoids?\n\nGastroenterologist Graeme Young from Flinders University says there are a number of clear signs of a haemorrhoid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Haemorrhoids are, in the beginning, internal and small,\" Young tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's only when they start to bulge down a bit through the anus that they become apparent and you can feel uncomfortable in that area.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Melanie was sceptical of this underutilised cancer treatment. It saved her life\n\n\"Usually, when you're wiping yourself after passing a bowel action, you will feel something is not right.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says that you will be able to feel if you have a haemorrhoid and says it might feel like there's \"a couple of grapes in there\". You might also be able to see blood on your toilet paper as a result of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaemorrhoids are one of the most common anorectal health conditions in Australia.\n\n\n\nWhat's scrolling got to do with it?\n\nProfessor Rupert Leong, a gastroenterologist based at Concord Hospital in Sydney, says the prevailing theory is that haemorrhoids are caused by straining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People who sit on toilets, especially those who sit on for extensive periods of time and may not be focused on just defecating, they are distracted doing other things whilst defecating \u2014 i.e. on smartphones,\" he tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This activity may be prolonging the defecation process, resulting in excessive straining, which can then increase the pressure of the blood vessels that lead to vascular swelling, and eventually rupture of the vessels that lead to bleeding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the recent study found straining while using the toilet was not, in and of itself, associated with increased haemorrhoid risk, in contrast to some prior studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is possible that time spent on the toilet is a more accurate predictor of haemorrhoids than straining,\" the study authors write.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Would you seek health advice from TikTok? Why experts are sounding fresh cautions\n\nDr Jarrah Dowrick, a research fellow at the University of Auckland, says time spent on the toilet is most likely the primary potential risk-factor being captured by the study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From what I can see, this paper is a thinly veiled study of the relationship between time spent on the toilet and haemorrhoids, but using the catchier hook of \"phone use\" to attract wider attention,\" he told the Australian Science Media Centre (ASMC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The real story here is that spending longer on a seated toilet appears to be linked with haemorrhoid presentation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe notes that it's still an \"important finding\", adding that there is a lack of evidence for commonly believed haemorrhoid risk factors like low fibre intake, straining, or time on the toilet.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO The effects of scrolling social media on your brain SBS News 02:54 English\n\nAnother possible reason for the findings is that smartphone use on the toilet might be disrupting gut-brain communication, says Dr Kate MacKrill, gastroenterology psychologist at Middlemore Hospital and a lecturer at the University of Auckland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our digestive system is controlled by the enteric nervous system, which is essentially the body's second brain,\" she told ASMC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sitting on the toilet for longer than you need to might start to change the signals the bowel sends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The bowel becomes unsure whether it has completely evacuated, leading to abdominal pain, actual constipation, discomfort, and an even longer time sitting on the toilet.\"\n\n\n\nSome tips to lower haemorrhoid risk\n\nTo lower the risk of developing haemorrhoids, try to be efficient, strain-free, and focus on the job at hand, Young says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For people who have a difficult bowel habit in terms of initiating the bowel action, the chances are they are going to be sitting longer on the toilet and straining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What it really boils down to is it's not a good idea to be sitting on the toilet for ages, waiting and hoping for something to happen, and especially straining to achieve that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, he says that, if there is no action, \"you need to get up and leave it, and come back to it later on\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Need to wee more during winter? This could be why\n\nAlong with time spent on the toilet, other commonly believed haemorrhoid risk factors include low fibre intake, straining, constipation, age, sex differences and pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung encourages people to address any constipation and says that's one of the \"real problems\" associated with haemorrhoid formation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If there is a real problem of constipation \u2014 and by constipation we mean not going to the toilet often enough \u2014 then you really need to get the constipation dealt with by dietary fibre, and discuss with the doctor if that doesn't work,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I'm not sure that it's to do with reading the phones \u2014 I think people are reading the phones cause they're sitting there waiting for something to happen \u2026 it's more about sitting on the toilet for too long than it is about scrolling down the phone.\"\n\n\n\nHow can you treat haemorrhoids?\n\nIf you suspect you might have haemorrhoids, experts say you should visit a GP, who will ask you about your symptoms and will examine your anal passage to look for any swollen blood vessels.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Leong says the GP visit could also be useful in ruling out more serious conditions, including bowel cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The symptoms of haemorrhoids are non-specific \u2014 so a passage of red blood can be something as benign as a haemorrhoid or it can be something more sinister that includes bowel cancer,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\"So anyone who's got bleeding in the bowel should present to the general practitioner, who would perform an external examination.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pain and inflammation from haemorrhoids can often be easily treated with over-the-counter medications from the pharmacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more severe cases, your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid cream. Less often, a surgical procedure might be needed.\n\n\n\n",

But the people who use their phone - while they are on the toilet - that is disgusting. And I am one of those people (audience laughter). Sometimes I go to the bathroom and I sit down and I'm like: oh man, I forgot my phone. And I sit there all bored. I wonder what my phone is doing?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's US stand-up comedian Anjelah Johnson-Reyes on Tik Tok, confessing about her phone use while on the toilet.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it's not only a phone full of germs you should be worried about.\n\n\n\n\n\nSitting on the toilet for too long and scrolling through your social media accounts or clearing out your emails can increase your risk of developing haemorrhoids.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Rupert Leong is a gastroenterologist based at Concord Hospital in Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The theory is that the pathogenesis (way the condition develops) of this vascular swelling is due to straining. So people that sit on toilets especially those that sit on for extensive periods of time and may not be focused on just defecating. They are distracted doing other things whilst defecating i.e. on smartphones. This activity may be prolonging the defecation process, resulting in excessive straining, which can then increase the pressure of the blood vessels that lead to the vascular swelling; and eventually rupture of the vessels that lead to bleeding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHaemorrhoids is one of the most common anorectal health conditions in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlinders University Emeritus Professor Graeme Young is a gastroenterologist.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there are number of clear signs of a haemorrhoid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Haemorrhoids are in the beginning internal and small. It's only in the modern day TV and news that we would be discussing this sort of detail isn't it? It's only when they start to bulge down a bit through the anus that they become apparent and you can feel uncomfortable in that area. And usually when you're wiping yourself after passing a bowel action you will feel something is not right. You'll even feel haemorrhoids and if they get really big and bulge well yes they're big and bulging and they feel like a couple of grapes in there. You will know if you've got haemorrhoids either because of the physical presence or the suggestion they are there because of the bleeding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA new US study published in peer-reviewed PLOS ONE journal surveyed 125 adults, aged 45 and older, who were having a colonoscopy at a hospital in Boston (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe were asked how often they used their phones while on the toilet - and for how long.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey found 66 per cent of all participants used smartphones while on the toilet, with that group spending more time - over five minutes - on the toilet than non-phone toilet users.\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking the news and using social media were the most common smartphone toilet activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe researchers suggest that smartphone use may inadvertently prolong toilet time, potentially increasing pressure in anal tissues, which may then lead to haemorrhoids.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Young says the focus should be on being efficient and strain-free in your bowel movements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For people who have a difficult bowel habit in terms of initiating the bowel action, the chances are they are going to be sitting longer on the toilet and straining. What It really boils down to is it's not a good idea to be sitting on the toilet for ages; waiting and hoping for something to happen, and especially straining to achieve that. If you go to the toilet and nothing is happening fairly quickly, you really need to get up and leave it; and come back to it later on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pain and inflammation from haemorrhoids can often be easily treated with over-the-counter medications from the pharmacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more severe cases, your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid cream.\n\n\n\n\n\nLess often, a surgical procedure might be needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with time spent on the toilet, other commonly believed haemorrhoid risk factors, include: low fibre intake, straining, constipation, age, sex differences and pregnancy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If there is a real problem of constipation - and by constipation we mean not going to the toilet often enough - then you really need to get the constipation dealt with by dietary fibre; and discussion with the doctor if that doesn't work. So I'm not sure that it's to do with reading the phones (scrolling on the phone). I think people are reading the phones cause they're sitting there waiting for something to happen and what are they going to do? So it's an interesting study, but I think it's more about sitting on the toilet for too long than it is about scrolling down the phone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are haemorrhoids diagnosed?\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts say you should firstly visit your general practitioner who will ask you about your symptoms and will examine your anal passage to look for any swollen blood vessels.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Leong says the GP visit could also be useful in ruling out more serious conditions, including bowel cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The symptoms of haemorrhoids is non-specific so passage of red blood can be something as benign as a haemorrhoid or it can be something more sinister that includes bowel cancer. So anyone who has got bleeding in the bowel should present to the general practitioner who would perform an external examination. Just by looking can help to confirm haemorrhoids however somebody who has not had sufficient investigations they should have a colonoscopy. So I'm talking about someone who hasn't had a colonoscopy before or now getting in the age group where bowel cancer can be common. Then they should present to a gastroenterologist who can then perform a colonoscopy which is a fixable telescope that goes up the rectum into the bowel to have a good view on the inside. I think that's the true way to exclude something sinister.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Kate MacKrill is gastroenterology psychologist at Middlemore Hospital, and a lecturer at the University of Auckland.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe told the Australian Science Media Centre that smartphone use on the toilet might be disrupting gut-brain communication.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the human digestive system is controlled by what's called the enteric nervous system - a neural network within the gastrointestinal tract, which is often described as the body\u2019s second brain.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr MacKrill says sitting on the toilet for longer than you need to might start to change the signals the bowel sends, making the bowel unsure whether it has completely evacuated, leading to abdominal pain, actual constipation, discomfort, and an even longer time sitting on the toilet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Coalition needs to learn some hard lessons from a fortnight dominated by fallout after Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price falsely claimed Labor was prioritising the intake of Indian migrants to boost its vote, experts say.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice has since been demoted from the frontbench and Opposition leader Sussan Ley has apologised on behalf of the Liberal Party \"to all Indian Australians and indeed others who were hurt and distressed by the comments\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, despite calls from some Indian Australian figures for a direct apology from Price, that has not been forthcoming. She has, however, said her comments were \"clumsy\" and that she \"never intended to be disparaging towards our Indian community\".\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal senator Jane Hume said there had been \"mishandling on all sides\" and hoped the Coalition would learn from its \"entirely unedifying week\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The good news is, we have cauterised the wound,\" she told Seven's Sunrise on Friday.\n\n\n\n\"We are going to move on now and talk about what's important to ordinary Australians,\" Hume said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what are the lessons the Coalition should take from this \"unedifying\" episode, and how should they better connect to \"ordinary Australians\"?\n\n\n\n'Acting like a bunch of babies'\n\nRedbridge director of strategy and analytics Kos Samaras said the imbroglio showed the Coalition still hadn't learned important lessons from the last two elections.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former Labor Party strategist said that, while it's true that Indian Australians do skew towards supporting Labor, the Coalition needed to take a far more constructive approach to dealing with its lack of popularity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With the Labor Party, when we were presented with stats about how Labor was struggling with particular constituencies, we did not reject them \u2026 we did not demonise the community that was attached to them. We tried to find out ways to fix that problem,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, instead of acting like a bunch of babies at a creche, perhaps they need to be professional about their profession and work out ways to fix this.\"\n\n\n\nRedbridge's research showed two-party-preferred support for Labor among Indian Australians in the 2025 election was in the \"mid-60s\", Samaras said recently.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, new polling from Roy Morgan suggests that, among Indian-born Australians, 45 per cent back the ALP, compared to 39 per cent support for the Coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\nSamaras said the effect of Price's comments could be comparable to former prime minister Scott Morrison's \"ham-fisted approach\" to the Australian Chinese community, which resulted in many voters from that community turning away from the Coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 48 per cent of Chinese-born Australians now support Labor, while only 34 per cent favour the Coalition, the recent Roy Morgan poll suggested.\n\n\n\n'They don't like us'\n\nWhile many Chinese and Indian Australians had socially conservative values that the Coalition should be able to appeal to, Samaras said, this opportunity had been squandered by a perceived antipathy towards these groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we interview Indian Australians in particular \u2026 they have socially conservative views on a whole range of issues. We say: 'Well then, why aren't you voting for the Liberal Party?' Their answer is: 'They don't like us'.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said to avoid continuing electoral erosion, the Coalition needs to \"embrace the reasons why diverse Australians come to this country in the first place\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And that is to start a family, be prosperous and enjoy a peaceful life. They need to understand that that's why most new Australians arrive here, looking for that life, looking for that prosperity,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSuccessful political leaders in Australia understand that elections in Australia are won from the centre, Samaras said, warning that Price's comments seemed to be imported \"from an environment which is all about mobilising and energising your base\".\n\n\n\n\n\nImporting United States-style culture war issues into a country with compulsory voting was bound to fail, Samaras said, \"because you have to actually find out ways to connect with the disengaged, the undecided\".\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice's suggestion that Labor was prioritising groups of migrants who were inclined to politically support them echoes an accusation commonly made by conservative Americans against the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\n'A cautionary tale to get the house in order'\n\nContinuing fracture in the Coalition will also be poorly received by voters, Zareh Ghazaria, a political scientist in the School of Social Sciences at Monash University, said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the things that we've seen in Australian politics is that once voters get a sense that a political party is divided over policy, over personnel, then they tend to turn away from that party,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nVictoria, where the Coalition has been out of power for over 10 years, provided federal conservatives with \"a cautionary tale to get the house in order\", he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[The Victorian Coalition] has been rife with internal instability, a party that has had debates about its personnel and policy settings, and voters have responded accordingly by not voting for them,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhile the Liberal Party has always had ideological divisions, Ghazaria said, \"the trick has been for successful leaders to somehow accommodate both strands\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The current situation and the current tension between the more progressive and more conservative Liberals has really been amplified by the fact that it suffered such a heavy loss at the last election,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the Coalition's disastrous 2025 federal election result, many Coalition figures pushed for a change of direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutgoing veteran senator Simon Birmingham called for \"a reshaping of the party to connect it with the modern Australian community\" and explicitly criticised \"judgemental attitudes that exclude or isolate some\".\n\n\n\nOpposition immigration spokesperson Paul Scarr told The Guardian it was a \"profound tragedy\" that Chinese, Indian and other diaspora communities had turned away from the Liberal Party.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a television interview this week, he again emphasised the importance of ensuring that debate about immigration \"doesn't become a debate about any particular part of the Australian community\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we're talking about these issues, we're talking about failures of government policy.\"\n\n\n\nA 'contest for what the party stands for'\n\nGhazarian also said if the Coalition wanted to have a debate about immigration, it should be \"a debate that focuses on the government's performance\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think we've seen hints of it, where it's been linked to economic prosperity and service delivery,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That provides the Opposition with a platform to demand more from the government to increase investment in infrastructure, to demand investment in service delivery, to demand investment in schools, education, hospitals, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That plays to the Liberal Party's strengths, you'd think, in that it focuses on economic management.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don't think migration was a huge turning point for this election or the previous election. The election was very much focused on cost of living and economic policy,\" he added.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Accusing others of a woke agenda, Peter Dutton became a victim of his own culture war\n\nThe recent controversy showed the Liberal Party was still in the midst of a \"real contest for what the party stands for,\" Ghazarian added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Is the party wanting to potentially portray itself as being a broad party that can represent the interest of all sorts of views in the community, or is it going to seek to pursue much more narrower policy focus, which looks at things like immigration, things like cultural identity, and so on.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince demoting Price, Ley has said the Coalition would remodel its policy development processes to seek input from a wider range of voices.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe told The Australian that the Coalition's policy development process would \"evolve throughout the term in response to internal and external feedback, emerging issues, and ongoing engagement with the community\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Samaras believes the Coalition won't find it easy to shift towards a more centrist policy platform.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think the grip that right-wing echo chambers have on the Coalition's membership is strong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I think the Coalition's membership is going to continuously animate their MPs and make it very difficult for the parliamentary wings to completely detach from a form of politics that clearly is not popular in this country.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Miran appointment, while certain to be rubber-stamped by the Republican majority in the Senate, is controversial because he has said he won\u2019t resign from his role as chair of Trump\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, instead taking an unpaid leave of absence. Miran was nominated to fill the remaining term of former governor Adriana Kugler, who resigned last month, even though her term wasn\u2019t scheduled to end until January 31 next year. It is unclear if he will remain on the board beyond that date. Trump is still trying to fire Cook on the basis of an allegation made on social media that hasn\u2019t been proven and now appears to have been disproved. Credit: AP By remaining a key Trump adviser while serving as a governor, Miran, regarded as the architect of the administration\u2019s more contentious economic policies \u2013 including the tariffs and Trump\u2019s efforts to bring the Fed under the administration\u2019s control \u2013 would not be an independent in an institution that Congress designed to be independent of politics. Unlike Waller or Bowman, appointed by Trump but not part of the administration (although Waller is on the short list to be the next Fed chair and therefore wouldn\u2019t want to be offside with Trump), he\u2019d clearly be Trump\u2019s main man inside the Fed.\n\nThe Cook affair is also tainted. Trump purported to fire her last month, via a social media post, after the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, alleged (in a social media post, of course) that she had named two separate properties as her principal place of residence in loan documents, which may have enabled her to borrow more cheaply. Loading She\u2019s not been charged with anything and can only be sacked \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is generally thought to mean that the official has done something seriously wrong while in office. The initial judgment that the administration is appealing was that Trump\u2019s justification for firing Cooke didn\u2019t meet the threshold for sufficient cause, in part because the alleged actions occurred before she was a governor. As it happens, what Pulte and Trump have alleged may not even have occurred.\n\nFirst Reuters, and then a string of major media outlets, have said Cook described her second property as \u201ca vacation home,\u201d not as her principal place of residence, in loan documents they have seen. Cook\u2019s lawyers have said any errors in the loan documents, if there were errors, were unintentional and might be the results of clerical errors. If the documents Reuters and others have sighted \u2013 which appear to be loan estimates provided by a credit union \u2013 exist then, regardless of what the final loan documents showed, the lender would have been aware that the loan was for a holiday home, not as her primary residence. In other words, Trump is still trying to fire Cook on the basis of an allegation made on social media that hasn\u2019t been proven and now appears to have been disproved. The allegations are a pretext to try to open another spot on the Fed board for a Trump appointee. If Trump can gain a majority of the seven-person board, he would then be in a position to remake the FOMC, where the remaining members are the president of the New York Fed and the presidents of four of the Fed\u2019s 12 regional banks, who serve on a rotating basis. The Fed\u2019s board can veto those appointments.\n\nThe White House, with a president who has said he wants the federal funds rate cut by three percentage points, would be able to dictate US monetary policy, ending three quarters of a century of the US central bank\u2019s independence. When the Fed last met, in July, for the first time in more than 30 years there were two governors \u2013 Waller and Bowman \u2013 who dissented from the majority\u2019s decision to hold rates steady. The interest this week will be in whether Miran, Waller and Bowman, argue for something more than the 25 basis points cut expected. The majority is likely to be conservative \u2013 there could be some who argue for rates to remain on hold \u2013 because, while the jobs market appears to be shrinking and the unemployment rate is rising, the full effects of Trump\u2019s tariffs are yet to show up in the data. That\u2019s because of the on-off-on way they were implemented, which allowed companies to build up inventories of goods before the tariffs took effect. With the main \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs finally going live last month, their impact on prices will progressively show up over the rest of this year and beyond. The worst-case outlook for the Fed is one of stagflation: low economic growth, or even a recession, while the inflation rate remains high. Trump\u2019s trade wars and his immigration policies make it possible that there could be, simultaneously, rising unemployment and rising inflation.",

But even 30 minutes later, a gobsmacked Contepomi couldn\u2019t bring himself to wave it away with an \u201call\u2019s well than ends well\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating. I think we don\u2019t deserve that. So I\u2019ve got mixed emotions. It\u2019s very frustrating, because it\u2019s not working. It\u2019s as simple as that. It\u2019s not working. The system, whatever they are doing to get it better, there\u2019s no consistency and it\u2019s not working.\u201d Rounding out the strange day, the Wallabies - the losing team who been caned 14-7 and had every right to pour fuel on the same bonfire - then came in and bit their tongues. Referee Christophe Ridley gestures to Harry Wilson. Credit: Getty Images Showing his years of experience, Joe Schmidt rattled off half-a-dozen things he\u2019d observed but surmised they couldn\u2019t worry about it. It was the wise approach, for a bunch of reasons. Referees are like elephants, and you\u2019ll get them again.\n\nBut it\u2019s fair to say the referee and the match officials, to put it mildly, had a rough day. Ridley is an inexperienced young Test referee and, as can occur, his attempts to stamp authority early on for minor stuff set in motion a game that may have got away from him. He then didn\u2019t stay consistent, which irked the captains, and when new penalties in key moments were found from areas he\u2019d previously ignored - like high shots and obstruction by retreating defenders - the captains\u2019 grumbles spread out and into a very restless home crowd. Santiago Carreras kicks a goal for Argentina. Credit: Getty Images In many ways, it made for brilliant theatre. With a record crowd (post-rebuild), the joint was absolutely rocking. Nothing brings people together more than booing a referee whose calls they don\u2019t agree with. In the end, all the match officials were so rattled they were the only four people in the stadium who missed, or cleared, a blatant forward pass. Even Wallabies players had their hands on their heads, missed-soccer-goal style.\n\nThe game ended in a loss for the Wallabies but oddly enough, the crackling atmosphere was arguably one of the best in years, possibly decades. With unprecedented numbers of people in generations of gold jerseys, old and new, and with lots of kids in the stands, the sense of injustice only served to unite - and amplify - the support. Loading Pubs and restaurants around Paddington and Surry Hills did a roaring trade of post-game analysis. And, also encouragingly, most Aussie fans agreed the end result was the right one. For all the harsh calls on the Wallabies, the Pumas had still been the better side on the day; hungrier and cleaner in most contests, and certainly more physical. The Wallabies mostly had themselves to blame. After getting that dangerous taste of space early - Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii\u2019s fifth-minute try came after the Wallabies had gone backwards with their carrying - the home team then frantically chased even more quick kills.\n\nWallabies players spoke post-game about the need to fix up their discipline, having gone from 10 Tests in two Tests in South Africa to 25 in two clashes with Argentina. And patience and belief in teammates is usually the antidote to cutting penalty counts. But patience also the key to being more clinical, a bit more boring and winning a game like the one at Allianz Stadium. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really efficient off our line breaks, but probably the last two weeks we\u2019ve tried to score off those line breaks as opposed to the patience of,\u201d Tate McDermott said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to weigh up whether the risk is actually worth the reward there.\u201d For all the Australian fury at the referee team, the takeaway for the Wallabies is Contepomi was fuming too. Short of World Rugby doing the logical thing and using top Test referees for all top Tests, no matter their nationality (Angus Gardner was wasted as a touch judge in Wellington, for example), rookie refs will inevitably be inconsistent as they build experience.",

        "text": "You\u2019re in a group chat with your mates. And then one says something so off, you don\u2019t even know how to respond. So you let it go. Then you let it go again.\n\nIt\u2019s a common response, says Jackson Katz, author of the new book Every Man. He is in Sydney this week to deliver a keynote at the fifth World Conference of Women\u2019s Shelters, organised by WESNET, the Women\u2019s Services Network, a national network of specialist domestic and family violence services across Australia.\n\nBut that common response, that moment when you can\u2019t call out your mates, no matter how badly they behave, is partly why Katz and allies devised a new way of being a bystander. And it\u2019s not nearly as terrifying as having to confront your mates.\n\nTeenage boys and young men may want to speak up, but it can be particularly difficult in group settings. Credit: Marija Ercegovac/ digitally altered\n\nThere is, says Katz, a pressure to remain silent just to fit in. It starts at school and gets reinforced, particularly if you are part of what he describes as \u201ccohesive organisational cultures\u201d. Work, sport, it happens everywhere \u2013 and it\u2019s strengthened because you are all mates, pals, good guys here.",

        "text": "\u201cThen there was a $75,000 attempted knockout bid, which did see one party drop out, followed by a quick succession of more $25,000 bids until it got to $1.45 million when I called it on the market,\u201d said Dardha. \u201cI couldn\u2019t call it any earlier because it was just so hot.\u201d Three active bidders, a mix of young couples and young families, participated, and a young family won. With the townhouse next door also built and owned by the same vendors as the property just sold at auction, Dardha suggested to the two parties who missed out that they inspect it.\n\n\u201cOne took me up on the offer, and after we had a look through, they bought that one for $1.39 million,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the other underbidder came up and asked to see it, and I had to tell them it was already sold.\u201d The property was one of 1184 scheduled auctions in Melbourne last week. By Saturday evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 71.5 per cent from 911 reported results, while 72 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate. In Ascot Vale, a family relocating from nearby Flemington secured the keys to a renovated Victorian terrace for $1.63 million. The home at 47 Kent Street, built in 1890, had a price guide of $1.45 million to $1.55 million, and a reserve of $1,575,000.\n\nFour active bidders, all families looking to upsize, took part in the auction, which was held in the property\u2019s backyard in front of a crowd of about thirty. Loading The bidding opened at $1.5 million and then \u201cwent up in $25,000 and $20,000 bids, then slowed down later to $10,000 and $5,000,\u201d said selling agent Adam Hicks from Jellis Craig Kensington. The quality renovations completed 10 years ago, including hydronic-heated polished concrete floors and European appliances, were a drawcard for prospective buyers. \u201cThe renovation was of a high standard and completed by a well-respected local builder,\u201d said Hicks.\n\nThe property last sold in 2013 for $750,000, records show. Meanwhile, in Ferntree Gully, a first-home buyer paid $952,000, $112,000 over the reserve, for a three-bedroom home with dual street access. The updated home at 7 Scenic Court, on a corner block of 683 square metres, had a price guide of $780,000 to $840,000 and a reserve of $840,000. Three active bidders \u2013 a mix of first home buyers and a young couple - participated in the auction, which opened at $730,000.\n\n\u201cThe second bid of $120,000 brought it up to $850,000 and put it officially on the market,\u201d said lead agent and auctioneer, Matt Morris from Ray White, Ferntree Gully. Loading Morris said a bidder dropped out after this bid, leaving two others to go back and forth until it was sold, with the knockout bidder, a first-home buyer, successful. \u201cThe new owner took my advice of pretending to have more money than you actually do,\u201d Morris said. Morris said that the buyer wanted to purchase a property before October 1st.",
