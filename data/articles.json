(Dion Georgopoulos)\n\nRobert Half commissioned research into 500 hiring managers in finance and accounting, IT and technology and human resources from small to medium, large private and public sector businesses across Australia.\n\nSmall to medium businesses were found to have received 11 per cent more concerns from staff than large businesses.\ufeff\n\nAnd a staggering 78 per cent of employers in Western Australia \ufeffwere more likely to receive formal complaints from staff, followed by 62 per cent in Queensland, 43 per cent in NSW and 42 per cent in Victoria.\n\nRobert Half director Nicole Gorton said cultural norms and local industry dynamics played a role in how the legislation is being embraced in different regions.\n\nThe survey found that 93 per cent of employers \ufeffhad introduced at least one measure to support their staff's right to disconnect.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Mushroom triple murderer arrives at court to face her victims\n\nThe right to disconnect was passed in February 2024 and came into effect in August that same year.

        "text": "Like many Labubu fans, 28-year-old American Joselyn Chamorro is over the craze.\n\nWaiting in overnight lines to buy the $US30 ($46) mischievous dolls, or shelling out $US100 to resellers, has lost its appeal. So when she saw a service station in Florida, was selling fake Labubus \u2014 known as Lafufus \u2014 for $US20, she didn't hesitate to buy one.\n\nTrying to get a real Labubu, \"it's almost like The Hunger Games ,\" Chamorro said.\n\nPop Mart, the Chinese manufacturer of the hugely popular Labubu dolls, expects a revenue of $US4.2 billion this year. (Getty)\n\nJust like an authentic Labubu, it even came in a blind box, meaning the buyer doesn't know the specific doll they're getting.\n\nLabubu's maker, Pop Mart, seems unstoppable. The Beijing-based toy company expects its revenue this year to exceed 30 billion yuan, or $US4.2 billion.\n\nJust in the Americas, revenue soared by more than 1000 per cent year-on-year, according to Pop Mart's semi-annual report released in August. Globally, revenue for Labubus alone skyrocketed 668 per cent in the first half of the year.\n\nBut as rapidly as Labubus have risen in popularity, they could fall just as fast.\n\n\n\nShortages of the creepy-cute dolls, on top of the $US20 to $US40 price tag, have driven shoppers to look for alternatives.\n\nPop Mart's strength lies in its creations that draw a cult following \u2013 Labubus, Cry Babies and Molly figurines \u2013 but the company still needs to grow past virality, Morningstar analyst Jeff Zhang said.\n\nREAD MORE: Vietnam plans mass evacuation as Typhoon Kajiki intensifies\n\nThe Labubu doll pop-up store at Westfield, Pitt Street, Sydney. (Jessica Hromas) (Nine)\n\n\"Compared with global leaders such as Disney and Sanrio, Pop Mart has yet to demonstrate a sufficiently long track record of generating excess return on invested capital from self-owned IPs,\" Zhang wrote.\n\nAnd in a twist, Lafufu owners aren't afraid to share they have a knock-off.\n\nChamorro's fake is smaller than the real Labubus, and its hands and face may be two different shades. But the palm-sized toy bears holds the same mischievous grin and soft fur that made the original go mind-bogglingly viral.\n\n\"My little monster, even though he's not authentic, he's still really cute in his own little way,\" Chamorro said.\n\nPop Mart isn't playing around\n\nPop Mart has trademarked \"Labubu\" since 2019 in the US and at least 2016 internationally, according to the company's legal filings. And China is cracking down on Lafufus, with its customs agents seizing droves of fakes.\n\nThere's a certain irony in China's possessiveness over its Labubu IP. The country is known for pushing out fakes of practically every well-known brand, accounting for 45 per cent of all reported seizures of counterfeit goods in 2021, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nPop Mart has launched lawsuits against retailers selling fake Labubu dolls. (Getty)\n\nIt also doesn't rank too highly in the US Chamber IP index, which measures the strength of intellectual property among different nations.\n\nPop Mart Americas recently sued a group of 7-Eleven stores in California for selling counterfeit Labubus. Zhang said more companies may face lawsuits from Pop Mart over Lafufus, but counterfeits might also decrease as Pop Mart ramps up its production.\n\nA consumer standards body in the UK warned fake Labubu dolls could pose a choking hazard for young children. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission, which issued a similar warning, noted a real Labubu will feature a holographic Pop Mart sticker, a scannable QR code linking to the official Pop Mart site and exactly nine teeth; newer Labubus will also have \"a subtle UV stamp on one foot.\"\n\nWhat's driving demand for Labubus?\n\nThese days, you may see more Lafufus on the streets than Labubus, especially as social media has destigmatised the shame of owning knock-off toys.\n\nLafufus are \"a lot more unique looking, you know, the little mess ups and the little quirks \u2026 people like that,\" Cassandra Harrison, a 32-year-old from New Jersey, told CNN.\n\nMany of her friends are starting Lafufu collections, and she recently found a wall of Lafufus at a phone repair store inside her local Super Walmart. But at the end of the day, Harrison still ended up purchasing a real Labubu.\n\nTurning Labubu, originally a storybook character, into a beloved plush wasn't exactly dumb luck, said Mark Tanner, managing director of consumer insights newsletter China Skinny . More and more Chinese companies are outpacing their Western competitors with rapid-fire product development, he told CNN.\n\nPop Mart did a lot of work behind the scenes to make the \"blind box\" approach work. Like most consumer trends today, the blind boxes appeal to shoppers who are scrolling through hyper-specific TikTok algorithms.\n\n\"(Pop Mart's strategy) just aligns really well with the way people are consuming information right now, where the algorithm does all the work for them. When you buy a Labubu, you're not having to make any choices,\" Tanner said.\n\nPop Mart also doesn't have the decades-long history as some of its Western competitors. So the company isn't as concerned about retaining loyal customers \u2014 it's still busy building its base.\n\nPop Mart has opened at least 50 stores this year around the world, Morningstar said. Morningstar analysts estimate that business outside China will account for 70 per cent of Pop Mart's revenue in 2034, compared with 39 per cent in 2024.",

(AP: Richard Drew/File)\n\nHe hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theatre, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014.\n\nHis father Philip Adler was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.\n\n\"I'm a creature of nepotism,\" Adler told TheaterMania in 2015.\n\n\"I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me [because] there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\"\n\nAfter a long theatre career, which included the original production of My Fair Lady and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump.\n\nHe moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera Santa Barbara.\n\n\"I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\" he told The New York Times in 1992.\n\nWhy are on-screen mobsters Catholic?

(Getty Images: Maddie Meyer)\n\n\"Buddy, please don't talk to the players please,\" he said.\n\n\" If you want to support, that's fine, but not directly at the player. \"\n\nMoutet called a medical timeout after losing the opening set 6-2 to 58th-ranked Thompson and appeared to be struggling physically at times.\n\nAfter holding serve for a 3-2 lead in the second frame, Moutet directed an angry celebration back at that corner of the crowd.\n\nHis coaches, sitting in the same section, tried to calm down their charge as he pointed and shouted past them at the fan.\n\nEventually, Moutet walked away and spoke to Keothavong, pointing back at the crowd.\n\nCorentin Moutet took issue with the fan speaking directly at him during the match. (Getty Images: Maddie Meyer)\n\nThe umpire walked to the section and called out the fan, wearing a gold Australian Socceroos or Matildas jersey from 2018.\n\nKeothavong directed the fan to leave, much to the delight of surrounding fans, who applauded, cheered and chanted \"Nah nah nah nah, hey hey hey, goodbye\".\n\nThe Australian fan remonstrated, shouting back at the fans while collecting his belongings and making his way out of the arena.\n\nThompson maintained his focus to run to a 6-4 win in the second set, before things unravelled in the third as Moutet found a second wind.\n\nThompson received a code violation for launching a ball into the stands after being broken for 4-0, and the French world number 40 jumped out to a 5-0 lead before taking the set 6-1.\n\nMoutet's standard remained high as the pair reached 3-3 in the third, but Thompson shelved his frustrations to break for 5-3 before holding to love to win the match and move into a second-round match with another French leftie, 37-year-old Adrian Mannarino.\n\nIt was a less successful day for fellow Australians Destanee Aiava and Rinky Hijikata, who both lost in straight sets to Italian opponents.\n\nAfter coming through qualifying, Aiava's second main draw at the US Open lasted just 94 minutes as she lost 6-2, 7-6(7/4) to seventh seed Jasmine Paolini.\n\nAnd Hijikata was on court for 10 minutes less as he lost 6-2, 6-1, 6-2 to 32nd seed Luciano Darderi.",

        "text": "After the AFLW season opener between Carlton and Collingwood, boundary umpires Melissa Sambrooks, Kaitlin Barr and Greta Miller were taken into a private room under the guise of getting some feedback.\n\nIn there, boundary coach Darren Wilson told them over the phone that the following weekend, they'd each become the first female boundary umpires to officiate a men's AFL game.\n\n\"We were all in shock,\" Miller told ABC Sport,\n\nShe and Sambrooks officiated Carlton and Essendon's game on Thursday, while Barr umpired North Melbourne and Adelaide's game at Docklands on Saturday.\n\n\"It just felt like a blur. That whole night my hands were shaking, I couldn't stop smiling. My cheeks hurt but it just felt so surreal,\" Miller said.\n\n\"I couldn't go to sleep [that night] because it felt like Christmas.\"\n\nBoundary umpiring can be especially challenging due to the physically and running capability required. (Getty: Robert Cianflone)\n\nThankfully for the Miller, the night came around very quickly, helping with the nerves and anticipation.\n\n\"As it got closer, I had to switch on and 'OK, job starts now',\" she said.\n\n\"I just treated it the same [as any game]. I still had nerves, but it was just making me perform better, just go to a higher level.\"\n\nBoth Miller and Sambrooks started umpiring at just 12 at their local footy league \u2014 both in search of some extra pocket money \u2014 while Barr took it up in her final year of high school.\n\nAll progressed through VFL and AFLW.\n\nIniativies by the AFL have seen female participation increase by 72 per cent in the last three years across all levels of umpiring. (Getty: Robert Cianflone)\n\nWhile Eleni Tee (100 games) and Chelsea Roffey (300 games) have broken new ground in field and goal umpiring respectively, there remain few female umpires at AFL level.\n\nIn 2022, women made up just 10.8 per cent of umpires across all levels and 2.6 per cent at AFL level.\n\nThat number has increased to just under 20 per cent (a 72 per cent increase) across all levels in the past three years, according to the AFL, with women making up 36 per cent of the AFLW umpire list.\n\nMelissa Sambrooks started umpiring when she was 12 at local league football and eventually progressed through VFL and AFLW. (Supplied: Melissa Sambrooks/Dylan Burns)\n\n\"Once you start running W games, you're running with ex-AFL umpires and the advice they give you excels your experience and skills. That's where I just took a big leap in my career,\" Miller said.\n\n\"Hopefully in the next couple of years, it just becomes so normal for female umpires to come through the AFL.\"\n\nOne of the challenges in getting women and girls into boundary umpiring, Sambrooks said, is the physicality and running capability required.\n\n\"You have to be such a good runner but also have the strength and abilities to throw the ball in whilst incorporating in reading the play, understanding what's happening, the positioning,\" Sambrooks said.\n\n\"So as much as a lot of people go, 'Oh, they're just running the boundary', there is so much more to it \u2026 but it's not something that's impossible, as we've shown.\"\n\nMiller said there was some nice symmetry in that she umpired the AFL women's exhibition game between Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs in 2015 at the MCG and was back 10 years later.\n\nKaitlin Barr officiated Saturday's match between North Melbourne and Adelaide. (Getty: Morgan Hancock)\n\nShe and Sambrooks officiated the very first AFLW game in 2017 together, while Barr umpired last year's AFLW grand final between North Melbourne and Brisbane.\n\nThey ran 16 kilometres during Thursday's match at the MCG.\n\n\"The first quarter was really tough without a goal in the first 15 minutes,\" Sambrooks said.\n\n\"Just continuous turnovers and having to work hard \u2026 Luckily, it was a little bit more consistent with goals for the rest of the game after that, but yeah, really big Ks and definitely tough on the body.\"\n\nFan of boundary umpires Olivia Grcic holds up sign during the North Melbourne and Port Adelaide AFLW game on Sunday afternoon. (Supplied: author.)\n\nAfter the game, Miller said the moment started to really sink in as the messages poured in from friends and family.\n\n\"I saw the AFL post something, and people are coming up to me, and they're like, 'Oh, you've made history',\" Miller said.\n\n\"Now I'm just like, wow, we myself, Mel and Kailtin, we're history makers now, and hopefully we're what makes younger girls look up to us and then want to do what we do too.\"",

(Supplied: Ausgold)\n\nMr Dorward said the \"considerable\" land acquisition allowed Ausgold to increase the buffer zone around the project, meaning it could look to expand further.\n\n\"What we are doing now is a quick update to our feasibility study that will show more gold production coming in over the life of the mine, which is really positive,\" Mr Dorward said.\n\n\"Over the course of the last 12 months, we've gone from a land holding of less than 50 hectares to around 2,000 hectares, and this was really the last major piece of the puzzle for us.\"\n\nAusgold says it will begin mining in 2027. (Supplied: Perth Mint)\n\nHe confirmed Ausgold was interested in increasing its landholding further.\n\n\"There are some additional parcels of land we would be interested in, but that is later in our 10-year mine life,\" he said.\n\n\"We will start mining early 2027, construction activities will be commencing around the middle of next year.\"\n\nAusgold has bought more farming land to continue its gold mine project.

(AP: Alfred A. Knopf)\n\nNobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice is scheduled for release this October, publishing house Alfred A Knopf confirmed to The Associated Press.\n\nMs Giuffre, who took her own life in April at age 41, had been working on Nobody's Girl with author-journalist Amy Wallace and had completed the manuscript for the 400-page book, according to Knopf.\n\nThe publisher's statement includes an email from Ms Giuffre to the journalist a few weeks before her death, saying that it was her \"heartfelt wish\" the memoir be released \"regardless\" of her circumstances.\n\n\"The content of this book is crucial, as it aims to shed light on the systemic failures that allow the trafficking of vulnerable individuals across borders,\" the email reads.\n\n\" It is imperative that the truth is understood and that the issues surrounding this topic are addressed, both for the sake of justice and awareness. \"\n\nMs Giuffre had been hospitalised following a serious accident on March 24, the publishing house said, and sent the email on April 1.\n\nShe died at her property in Neergabby in the shire of Gingin, about 80 kilometres north of Perth, on April 25.\n\n\"In the event of my passing, I would like to ensure that NOBODY'S GIRL is still released. I believe it has the potential to impact many lives and foster necessary discussions about these grave injustices,\" she wrote to Wallace.\n\nPrince Andrew, Virginia Giuffre, and Ghislaine Maxwell pictured in 2001 when Ms Giuffre was 17.

No one understands standing orders - literally - more than President Sue Lines!\" Long said in an exclusive quote (aka her leaning over the desk wall to tell me).\n\nWe're told this hopefully just the first naming of many things around Parliament House.

(ABC News: Jake Sturmer)\n\nFactor that in and you get a 99 per cent increase over the same period.\n\nBut that misses another important measure \u2014 how many people the health system is caring for.\n\nUsing the state's population as an estimate, budget dollars per person have risen over the last quarter of a century by around 158 per cent.\n\nBut factor in inflation and that growth gets much smaller, at 24 per cent per person in 2024/25 dollars.\n\nOf course, this is an oversimplification \u2014 it's hard to capture the complexity of the health system over a long period.\n\nTechnology has improved, making some treatments cheaper and quicker.\n\nAt the same time, new pathways for treatment have opened, creating new patients who might not have been able to be treated previously, which adds cost to the system.\n\nAll of this is even more of a problem because the percentage of West Australians aged over 65 at the end of each financial year is growing and the aged care system isn't coping, forcing some into hospital emergency departments.\n\nDoctors say all this has eaten away at reserve capacity in the health system, meaning when an event largely out of your control comes around \u2014 like a particularly bad flu season this year \u2014 there's little wiggle room left.\n\nPublic hospitals in Perth cancelled some elective surgeries last week as emergency departments were put under pressure. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"As long as we can move patients through the emergency department, we have flow to see the new patients coming in, we can cope with those busier periods,\" Australasian College for Emergency WA Deputy Faculty Chair Eve Foreman said.\n\n\"When we can't move the patients out of the emergency department into the hospital \u2026 that's when we have issues with ED feeling busier than it would do normally.\"\n\nTaking the pulse of WA\u2019s health system Photo shows A paramedic standing alongside a parked ambulance outside a hospital. Western Australia\u2019s ailing health system has once again been in the spotlight this week, but the remedy to its problems remains elusive.\n\nED patients are by-and-large those most in need of medical care, so hospitals have to find a way to meet that demand.\n\nSo when there's a higher-than-usual number of very ill patients being rushed into emergency departments \u2014 as there was last week \u2014 hospitals have few levers to pull but to cancel elective surgery to free up space.\n\n\"It's part and parcel of managing a health system which is, at the moment, managing one of the most severe winter flu seasons on record, so we thank people for their patience,\" Premier Roger Cook said on Thursday, adding it was always doctors who made decisions about how urgent a surgery is.\n\nThat, of course, ignores the fact that if it were up to doctors there wouldn't be elective surgeries in the first place because there would be enough hospital beds and operating theatres and staff to treat people when they need it.\n\nLast week the WA government announced a $50 million fund to fix ageing hospitals. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"If there was a quick fix or a silver bullet, someone would have found it,\" Amber-Jade Sanderson, who was Health Minister until March, said during the week.\n\nIt's why the increased funding to date hasn't solve the problem, and why experts continue to call for wholesale system reform, from access to GPs to catch problems early through to expanded hospital capacity and more discharge options instead of keeping people in hospital beds once they're better\n\nPatient's surgery cancelled after 350-day wait Photo shows A woman sits in her home, being interviewed A patient caught up in the immense pressure being placed on WA hospitals says her planned surgery being cancelled has put her under significant stress and eroded her trust in the health system.\n\nThe government's promise last week of $50 million to fix aging hospitals and conduct an audit to identify issues has bought it some time after a week of embarrassing media coverage of problems at Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.\n\nEfforts to convince the federal government to provide more aged care support including a premier-led delegation to Canberra next week also give it some cover.\n\nBut without meaningful change in the health of the health system, the government may head into the 2029 election having spent four years on the defensive about one of its most critical responsibilities.\n\nThere are few curlier questions in politics than how to manage the myriad demands on the health system.\n\nAnd there are few more critical issues for the Labor government to solve, both for our health and for its own political survival.",

        "text": "In annals of corporate raiding, President Donald Trump's extraordinary $US10 billion deal with chipmaker Intel is right up there for audacity and sets a new benchmark for \"state capitalism\" in the US.\n\nMr Trump said the US government would convert current and future government grants into equity, which would give it a 10% stake in the company.\n\nThat holding will make the US government Intel's biggest shareholder, ahead of the likes of investing behemoths like Vanguard (8.8%), BlackRock Institutional Trust (5.5%) and State Street Global Advisors (4.6%).\n\nGenerally, a corporate raid of such magnitude would attract a hefty premium, however the US government managed to get the stake for an absolute steal; a 20% discount to the Intel's share price immediately before the deal was made public.\n\nAs Reuters noted, the deal puts Mr Trump on better terms with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, after the president recently said the CEO should step down due to conflicts of interest.\n\nIt will also ensure that the chipmaker will receive about $10 billion in funds for building or expanding factories in the US.\n\nHowever, the deal is not exactly a fool-proof investment for US taxpayers given the recent troubles at Intel and the underperformance of its chips compared to the likes of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nGovernments are also notoriously bad stock pickers, with a penchant for pouring in good money after bad.\n\nHere's more from Reuters:\n\nUnder the agreement, the U.S. will purchase a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion, or $20.47 per share, which represents a discount of about $4 from Intel's closing share price of $24.80 on Friday.\n\nThe purchase of the 433.3 million Intel shares will be made with funding from the $5.7 billion in unpaid grants from the Biden-era CHIPS Act and $3.2 billion awarded to Intel for the Secure Enclave program, also awarded under Trump's predecessor, Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nIntel stock rose roughly 1% in the extended session on Friday after closing up 5.5% during regular trading.\n\nTrump met with Tan on Friday, a White House official said.\n\nThat followed Trump's August 11 meeting with the Intel CEO after Trump demanded that Tan resign over his ties to Chinese firms.\n\n\"He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States. So, we picked up $10 billion,\" Trump said on Friday.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X that Tan had struck a deal \"that's fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"\n\nThe Intel investment marks the latest unusual deal with U.S. companies, including a U.S. government agreement allowing AI chip giant Nvidia to sell its H20 chips to China in exchange for receiving 15% of those sales.\n\nOther recent deals include an agreement for the Pentagon to become the largest shareholder in a small mining company, MP Materials, to boost output of rare earth magnets and the U.S. government's winning a \"golden share\" with certain veto rights as part of a deal to allow Japan's Nippon Steel to buy U.S. Steel.\n\nThe federal government's broad intervention in corporate matters has worried critics, who say Trump's actions create new categories of corporate risk.\n\nAhead of the U.S. deal with Intel, Japan's SoftBank agreed to take a $2 billion stake in the chip maker on Monday.\n\nSome industry observers still question Intel's ability to surmount its problems.\n\nDaniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said Intel's problems are beyond a cash infusion from SoftBank or equity interest from the government, singling out Intel's contract chip manufacturing business, known as its foundry unit.\n\n\"Without government support or another financially stronger partner, it will be difficult for the Intel foundry unit to raise enough capital to continue to build out more Fabs at a reasonable rate,\" he said.\n\nThe government's stake is to be passive ownership and does not include a board seat, Intel said.\n\nThe government will be required to vote with Intel's board when shareholder approval is necessary, with \"limited exceptions.\" Intel did not specify the exceptions.\n\nThe equity stake also includes a five-year warrant at $20 a share for an additional 5% of Intel stock, which the U.S. can use if Intel loses control of the foundry business.\n\nFederal backing could give Intel more breathing room to revive its loss-making foundry business, analysts said, but it ceded the AI market to Nvidia and has lost market share to Advanced Micro Devices in its central processor business for several years. It has also faced challenges in attracting customers to its new factories.\n\nTan, who became CEO in March, has been tasked to turn around the American chipmaking icon, which recorded an annual loss of $18.8 billion in 2024 \u2014 its first such loss since 1986. The company's last fiscal year of positive adjusted free cash flow was 2021.",

        "text": "It's the \"transition technology\" that isn't going away.\n\nFor years, sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), which can burn fuel or run off a battery, have been tipped to fall as full-battery electric vehicles (BEVs) take their place.\n\nBut in Australia, another story is unfolding.\n\nPHEV sales are booming.\n\nOne year ago, not a single PHEV ute had been sold anywhere in Australia.\n\nToday, there are more than 12,000 on our roads, and a PHEV is the fourth best-selling ute in the country.\n\nTo some, PHEVs are a necessary \"stepping stone\" in the process of vehicle electrification, helping Australians get used to battery-powered cars.\n\nBut others argue PHEVs simply prolong our costly love affair with unnecessarily large cars.\n\nThese hybrids, they say, are effectively gas guzzlers dressed up as EVs, or \"wolves in sheep's clothing\".\n\nSo why are Australians reluctant to drop the fuel tank entirely, and what does it mean for reducing emissions?\n\nHybrid EVs versus full-battery EVs\n\nThe phrase electric vehicle (EV) may conjure images of 100 per cent battery-powered cars, but many EVs regularly burn fossil fuels.\n\nAnd these cars make up an increasing proportion of the EV market.\n\nIn the space of just two years, PHEVs have become a common sight on our roads, with more than 60,000 sold. (Getty: petovarga)\n\nPlug-in hybrids or PHEVs combine an internal combustion engine (like petrol or diesel) with an electric motor and a battery pack that can be charged from an external power source.\n\nThey generally emit less CO2 than equivalent-model full-combustion vehicles, but significantly more than BEVs, when used over an extended period of time.\n\nThis is because PHEV batteries are relatively small and, when they're empty, drivers tend to run the car on fossil fuels before recharging.\n\nPlug-in hybrids now about a quarter of EVs sold\n\nIn two years, PHEVs have gone from about a tenth of total EV sales to about a quarter.\n\nThe rise of PHEVs is making the story of the electrification of transport in Australia more complicated.\n\nYou may have heard that EVs are accounting for a larger proportion of new car sales.\n\nWhile this is true, a lot of the recent increase is due to PHEVs.\n\nBEV sales, as a proportion of new car sales, have actually plateaued at less than 9 per cent over the past two years.\n\nBut PHEVs recently shot from 1 per cent to 5 per cent of sales in less than a year.\n\nWhat's causing this deceleration is contested.\n\nGlobally, the pace of growth of EV sales outside of China has slowed, with EV market share in the US and Europe stagnating.\n\nOne theory is the BEV industry faces a challenge reaching customers beyond the \"early adopters\", partly due to concerns about charging infrastructure.\n\nAnother theory is the arrival of PHEVs has effectively siphoned sales from BEVs.\n\nIn Europe and the US, like in Australia, PHEV sales are booming.\n\nAre plug-in hybrids helping or hindering fully electric car sales?\n\nThe popularity of PHEVs has defied predictions.\n\n\"Amongst the EV community we're a little surprised,\" Ben Elliston, chair of the ACT branch of the Australian Electric Vehicle Association (AEVA), says.\n\n\"PHEVs came out of nowhere in the last few years.\n\n\"It seemed clear to us that BEVs are the better technology but the mainstream buyer seems to have different ideas.\"\n\nChris Jones, president of the AEVA, says PHEVs are undermining Australia's emission reduction goals.\n\n\" PHEVs were a transition technology ... but now I think they're a handbrake on BEV sales. \"\n\nBut others in the automotive industry have a very different take.\n\nThey say PHEVs are cracking a consumer segment that isn't yet ready to go all-electric.\n\n\"They're a real stepping stone for people to ultimately move into a battery electric vehicle, but are not yet prepared to take that step,\" Rohan Martin, CEO of the National Automotive Leasing and Salary Packaging Association (NALSPA), says.\n\nLarger cars like utes and SUVs make up most of PHEV sales. (Getty: petovarga)\n\nAman Gaur, head of legal policy and advocacy at the Electric Vehicle Council, said many Australians wanted to buy big, powerful cars like SUV and utes.\n\nPHEVs are meeting demand currently unserved by BEVs, he says, noting that some vehicle electrification is better than none.\n\n\"We don\u2019t live in the kind of country where we tell people what car to buy,\" he says.\n\n\" Some people may wish we drive smaller cars, like in Denmark, but we can't change that demand for larger cars. \"\n\nMike Costello, an analyst for automotive research firm Manheim Australia, says \"PHEVs are competing for the middle ground\", not just \"the so-called early adopters\".\n\n\"The BYD Shark ute for, example isn't just preaching to the converted, it\u2019s pulling people out of [full combustion] four-wheel drives.\n\n\"There's little doubt some people would have traded in [Toyota] Hiluxes and [Ford] Rangers [for Sharks].\"\n\nWho's buying PHEVs?\n\nMichael Formosa, whose company services and repairs garage doors and gates in Sydney, traded in four Ford Ranger diesel utes for four PHEV utes in December last year.\n\nOther than a few issues with battery range when towing, he's happy with the decision, which has meant spending less on fuel.\n\n\"I worked out we're doing about an eighth [of our travelling] in petrol and the rest in [battery power],\" he says.\n\n\" Without the [plug-in hybrid], I'd still be driving a petrol or diesel ute. \"\n\nUtes account for about 20 per cent of all vehicles sold in Australia, making them a big chunk of the market.\n\nThe only BEV or fully-electric ute available in Australia, the LDV eT60, has had well-documented performance problems, and is a third more expensive than popular PHEV models. Eight have been sold in Australia so far this year.\n\n\"There isn't yet a fit-for-purpose BEV for light commercial vehicles,\" Mace Hartley, executive director of Australasian Fleet Management Association, says.\n\nPHEVs, meanwhile, now account for more than 7 per cent of sales in the ute market.\n\nThis suggests tradies like Michael are buying PHEVs instead of petrol or diesel utes, and not instead of BEVs.\n\nBut utes aren't the only kind of PHEV selling well.\n\nAbout half of PHEVs sold in 2025 were small or medium-size SUVs, a vehicle class that, unlike utes, includes lots of popular BEVs.\n\nHere, it's harder to argue PHEVs are serving a demand unmet by BEVs.\n\nA 2024 NALSPA survey found that, compared to BEV owners, a relatively high proportion of PHEV drivers lived in outer suburbs or were based in regional areas.\n\nMany weren't yet ready for a BEV due to range anxiety, but would consider one as their next car.\n\n\"If you're charging a PHEV at home each night, you can run it as a pure electric vehicle and not have range concerns,\" NALSPA's Rohan Martin says.\n\nBut the AEVA's Chris Jones says Australians are simply buying what dealerships are stocking and promoting.\n\n\"We've become hooked on these large and somewhat unnecessary vehicles,\" he says.\n\n\"Dealers will claim that's what people want, but when you walk into a dealership you see a wall of PHEVs ... and the BEVs are harder to find.\"\n\nAre PHEVs good or bad news for emissions?\n\nWhen burning fuel rather than running on battery power, PHEVs (which carry heavy batteries) actually emit more than their full-combustion equivalents.\n\nThey're only low-emission options if drivers plug them in to recharge.\n\nThis means if they're not being recharged, more PHEVs could amount to more higher-polluting cars on our roads.\n\nA recent study from Europe, using onboard fuel-consumption data, found many PHEV drivers often don't recharge.\n\nAs a result, PHEVs may not be as clean as their rated emissions suggest (these ratings are based on the assumption drivers charge more often).\n\nMany plug-in-hybrids have a battery-range of more than 50km, which is a greater distance than the average Australian drives each day. (Supplied: Ford)\n\nBased on the study's results, PHEVs may only be about half as polluting as their full-combustion equivalents.\n\nThat's good, but only as good as a standard hybrid (a vehicle with an onboard battery that can't be plugged in to charge).\n\n\"They're not going to decarbonise transport like we need them to,\" Mr Jones says.\n\nModelling of the EV uptake required to meet Australia's Paris Agreement emissions reduction commitment assumes PHEVs will account for 4\u20135 per cent of new car sales by 2030.\n\nThat's roughly where PHEV sales are now, but the long-term trend appears to be upwards.\n\nAre plug-in hybrids the future or a temporary convenience?\n\nEarlier this year, the federal government lifted a key tax exemption for PHEVs, effectively making them more expensive to own through a novated lease.\n\n\"The prevailing sense within the industry was the lifting of the [tax] exemption would stall PHEV sales, but this hasn\u2019t happened,\" Manheim Australia's Mike Costello says.\n\n\"They\u2019ve slowed but not stalled.\u201d\n\nRather than shifting away from plug-ins, automotive brands are launching more PHEV models in the Australian market.\n\nThe Toyota RAV4, a top-selling medium SUV, will come with a PHEV option from 2026.\n\nBYD, meanwhile, will launch a mix of four to five new PHEV and BEV models in Australia over the next six months, the company's chief operating officer Stephen Collins says.\n\nChina turns into the world's first electrostate Photo shows A man stands on a busy market street with a looming coal plant's cooling towers in the background. China has put its economic might behind renewable technologies in a desire to stop relying on imported fossil fuels.\n\nThe future of PHEVs partly depends on whether car companies can build a BEV ute that Australians want to buy.\n\nIf they do, the rise of PHEVs may be just a flash in the pan.\n\nAccording to Mace Hartley from Australasian Fleet Management Association, Australia is \"18 months away from having BEV equivalents of the BYD Shark\".\n\nAman Gaur from the EV Council says improving battery technology means BEVs are the future, but plug-ins have a crucial role to play in the present.\n\n\"What we need is incentives to help people get into PHEV vehicles. We don't have any at the moment,\" he says.\n\n\"How are we getting people off petrol utes and into electrified utes?\"\n\nBYD's Stephen Collins says \"there's a place for plug-in hybrids in Australia over the next three to five years\".\n\n\"If we're looking at 10-years plus, maybe it's a different story.\"\n\nBatteries may be the future of transport, but the road to electrification is a twisty one.\n\nAnd the upstart plug-in is showing no sign of going away.",

There's no way we could have been living in this space in Ainslie by ourselves,\" Ms Reid said.\n\n\"For us to be able to share the land costs and the fixed cost to be able to do a build like this, it's meant that we've been able to achieve the sustainability objectives that we wanted and having more garden space which we just couldn't have afforded on our own.\n\n\"The aging in place piece is really important, which we're still happy about as well.\"\n\nOne of the kitchens in a unit at Stellulata, which was completed earlier this year. (Supplied)\n\nShared values\n\nEach resident's private space is smaller than a traditional house, but access to extensive common areas means the total available space remains similar \u2014 with shared costs.\n\nThey found that forming a company was the most suitable structure in the ACT for designing, building, managing and ultimately sharing their new home.\n\n\"Shared\" is a word that comes up regularly: shared resources and shared values, but also shared labour.\n\nUnlike traditional strata arrangements where this is outsourced, everyone in Stellulata contributes to take responsibility for different areas.\n\nSustainability and solar passive design informed the project. (Supplied: Stellulata )\n\nSome manage utilities, others handle the garden, and all major decisions involve all six residents.\n\n\"We all have our different ways of operating and that's really great,\" Mr Godfrey said.\n\n\"Some people have more time, less time, and some people go away for longer periods, so we can look after each other's places while people are away.\"\n\nChoosing a co-housing community\n\nMs Reid and Mr Godfrey discovered the project online while looking to upsize outside of the intensity and unaffordability of Sydney.\n\nMs Reid said she recalls Googling \"co-housing Canberra\", and when the Stellulata website popped up the couple went from there.\n\nThe property includes a row of three units in an inner suburb of Canberra. (Supplied)\n\nOver weeks there was an extensive interview stage.\n\n\"It was quite an interesting process because some might think it as an interview, that they were checking us \u2026 but simultaneously we were interviewing them,\" Mr Godfrey said.\n\n\"We needed to work out what were the threshold issues that either we would or we couldn't live with each other.\n\n\"We talked about issues of sustainability or environmental awareness, what sort of things interested us \u2026 whereas otherwise you buy into a strata place and you may or may not meet your neighbours before you buy or rent into a place.\"\n\nMs Macdonald says having a younger couple in the group gives diversity to their day and opens up their social circles.\n\n\"We're not in an aged care place. We're a normal part of the community,\" she said.\n\nCould it be replicated?\n\nCities and towns across Australia are continuing to grapple with the problem of housing affordability.\n\nIt is possible co-housing could offer a potential solution to the \"missing middle\" \u2014 housing options that are neither apartments nor suburban houses.\n\nThe project included the installation of solar batteries and panels. (Supplied)\n\nThe group agree the result is worth the effort, but Mr Ross candidly admitted it wasn't easy.\n\n\"It's fantastic but we were all pretty traumatised by the time we got to at the end of \u2026 seven years,\" he said.\n\n\"So it took us a little bit of time to settle in, but we are all feeling very relaxed in our units now.\"\n\nHe said that it could be replicated but in a different way.\n\n\"You probably wouldn't do it quite like this.\n\nCould you live in a smaller house? Photo shows Bird's eye view of rows of newly built houses with green lawns and solar panels on roofs. Amid a housing crisis and a quest to decarbonise, some Australians are asking how much space they really need to live well.\n\n\"You might choose to simply take an existing house, take advantage of some of the changed planning rules since we started, and make an extension or put in a second building, but treat it as a collaborative situation.\"\n\nWith another demonstration co-housing project for 30 units in Watson, Mr Ross is hopeful that these examples can show Canberrans a way to create a community in a conscious way.\n\n\"It does require conscious effort to make it work smoothly,\" he said.\n\n\"You can't assume that because you've known people for a long time, you'll be able to sort things out without thinking about it. It's not for everybody, but it's well worth it from our point of view.\"\n\nThe architecture of cooperation\n\nThe project's success depends as much on architecture as attitude.\n\nArchitect Brett Lowe designed the complex to be highly energy efficient and architecturally beautiful, leaning into the constrains of the smaller footprint to make the units feel large and spacious.\n\nThe outdoor layout is also built to encourage \"accidental\" encounters \u2014 moments when residents naturally cross paths.\n\nThe goal of Stellulata is to ensure everyone enjoys both privacy and a sense of community. (Supplied: Ian Ross)\n\n\"We want a situation where even when we're not intending to, we run into each other,\" Mr Ross said.\n\nThe buildings occupy 42 per cent of the land, leaving space for gardening, trees and a planned vegetable garden, which will sit in the front yard.\n\nThey hope to combine organic gardening with organic interactions with the neighbours as they walk past.\n\nArchitect Brett Lowe designed the co-housing property in collaboration with the co-owners. (Supplied)\n\nAlong with broader sustainability and the ability to use a large block for more people, the community aspect is what Mr Ross is most proud of.\n\n\" Being able to be with your neighbours, your close neighbours who you set up the co-housing community with, as well as with your broader neighbourhood. \"\n\nA long-term investment\n\nThe group all agree that this level of community development requires a serious time investment.\n\nBoth Mr Ross and Ms Macdonald were close to retirement when the project began, and said their partners joke that \"it couldn't have been done without the retired guys working on it\".\n\nThe residents hope their pioneering efforts might help nudge the idea further along to make it easier for others to replicate.\n\nIn a city where you might go days without seeing your neighbours, and with a loneliness epidemic already affecting Australians \u2014 there is a sense of optimism emanating from Stellulata.\n\nThe co-owners made sure to include a room for a snooker table. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\nIt also offers an alternative for those who cannot, or choose not to, live with their relatives.\n\n\"You don't have to scientifically prove that intergenerational wisdom, learning from elders, is a good thing but you don't always want to live next to your parents,\" Ms Reid said.\n\nThe group behind Stellulata is planning on showcasing their home on open days and said interest in the project is building.\n\n\"There's a long list of people who want to come and stay here, check out the place, including the snooker table behind us,\" Mr Godfrey said.\n\n\"And there's quite a long list of people thinking, 'hmm, this is not a bad way of living. I quite like this co-housing business'.\"",

Got it Share\n\nOne of Sydney\u2019s most prized restaurants, the two chefs\u2019 hatted Monopole, is set to close its doors on Saturday, September 6. A particularly tough winter trade has been gruelling for many Sydney restaurants, but co-owner Brent Savage, whose Bentley Restaurant Group includes Monopole in its stable, blamed the closure on the end of a lease at the restaurant, which overlooks Australia Square. Monopole\u2019s French makeover, with linen tablecloths and flickering candles. Dion Georgopoulos Savage said the CBD restaurant trade in 2025 felt more optimistic than last year, but confirmed rumours \u2013 swirling for months \u2013 that the Monopole site had been sounding out new operators. He is unsure of its future direction, however. \u201cWe looked at all our options,\u201d Savage said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter eight years in its original location, Monopole moved from Potts Point in late 2020, later shifting from a wine bar focus to a French-leaning venue last year. \u201cWe got a good review, I feel quite proud of what we\u2019ve achieved,\u201d Savage said. But the closure isn\u2019t the only news for the group, which is one of the most expansive and successful restaurant operations in Sydney. It will double down on its CBD restaurant openings King Clarence and Eleven Barrack with another new venue \u2013 Watermans \u2013 to open at Barangaroo in spring. From left: Nick Hildebrandt, Darryl Martin and Brent Savage will open Watermans in Barangaroo. Darryl Martin, the former owner-chef at Barzaari in Marrickville, will lead the Watermans kitchen. \u201cWe\u2019re massive fans of Darryl from his Barzaari days,\u201d Savage said. Pointing to Martin\u2019s labne with salted cucumber as a dish that will make its way onto the Watermans opening menu, Savage said other dishes they\u2019ve been working on include warm hummus with green zhoug; pickled watermelon and raw tuna salad with sumac; whole roasted John Dory with chermoula; and pomegranate-glazed slow-cooked lamb shoulder with pickled radishes and black lime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSavage stressed the restaurant start-up won\u2019t be a carbon copy of Barzaari. \u201cIt\u2019ll be Darryl\u2019s repertoire with a little of our finesse,\u201d Savage said. The 120-seat restaurant will slide into the recently completed One Sydney Harbour development at Barangaroo, a precinct where the Bentley crew has plenty of experience, having operated the now-closed Cirrus Dining nearby until 2024. Monopole\u2019s duck breast, with crisp skin and rosy meat, and an orange-scented glaze. Dion Georgopoulos The expansive restaurant group isn\u2019t ruling out a return for Monopole. \u201cIf it\u2019s the right site, never say never,\u201d Savage said.

        "text": "Then he went onto say that with policy in restrictive territory the outlook and shifting balance of risks might warrant adjusting the policy stance \u2013 i.e. a rate cut. The awkward position the Fed finds itself in is that on both sides of its mandate there are novel Donald Trump-inspired uncertainties. Ansell says price rises will offset Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on its products. Credit: AP The inflation rate, already materially above the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target rate, is picking up gradually as Trump\u2019s tariffs start to impact. Because the bulk of the globally applicable baseline tariffs only just started to come into effect this month, and US businesses had built significant pre-tariff inventories earlier in the year, they will show up progressively in the inflation rate through the rest of this year and into next year.\n\n\u201cThe effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts. The question that matters for monetary policy is whether those price increases are likely to materially raise the risk of an ongoing inflation problem. Loading \u201cA reasonable base case is that the effects will be relatively short-lived \u2013 a one-time shift in the price level,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is also possible, however, that the upward pressure on prices from tariffs could spur a more lasting inflation dynamic, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed,\u201d he said, noting that a decline in real incomes from higher prices could see workers demanding higher wages or that the price rises could lead to a lift in inflation expectations that dragged actual inflation up.\n\nIf the impact of the tariffs on inflation is uncertain, so is the impact of Trump\u2019s immigration policies on the unemployment rate. Last month\u2019s contentious jobs report \u2013 the one that got the Bureau of Labor Statistics sacked by Trump \u2013 showed US employment growth is stalling, even though the unemployment rate remains at an historically low level of 4.2 per cent. Markets heard what they wanted to hear. Credit: AP Complicating assessment of the labour market, however, is that even as the growth in jobs has flat-lined, the supply of labour has also softened \u2013 the pool of job-seekers has been shrunk because of Trump\u2019s harsh immigration policies. \u201cOverall, while the labour market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results in a slowing in both the supply and demand for workers., This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising and, if those risks materialise, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,\u201d Powell said.\n\nSo, both sides of the Fed\u2019s mandate are under pressure but the data that the data-dependent Fed relies on is, at this point, inconclusive. It remains very possible that both the inflation and unemployment rates could rise together. Trump, having spent years attacking Powell, is ramping up his campaign to \u201cMAGA-fy\u201d th Fed. The US economy is growing at about half the rate it did last year. Stagnation \u2013 low growth with relatively high inflation \u2013 remains a realistic possibility. That would confront the Fed with a very difficult choice of which side of its mandate to prioritise.\n\nPowell said it would not allow a one-time increase in prices to become an ongoing inflation problem, but when the risks to its dual mandate are evenly balanced, what does it do? History would suggest it would prioritise the fight against inflation. The Fed\u2019s predicament is worsened by Trump\u2019s continuing assaults on its independence. If it is to retain the credibility that is essential to bond investors\u2019 trust that it will act in accordance with its view of the economy\u2019s best long term interests, rather than short term political pressures, it can\u2019t be seen to be succumbing to Trump\u2019s campaign for radically lower interest rates \u2013 he wants them 3 percentage points lower \u2013 in order to lower the interest costs on America\u2019s exploding government debt levels and boost growth. That could, while it retains its independence, make it more cautious than it might otherwise be, relying on data that reflects the recent economic past to justify a rate cut or hike.\n\nTrump, having spent years attacking Powell, is ramping up his campaign to \u201cMAGA-fy\u201d th Fed. He\u2019s explored the possibility of sacking Powell, but doesn\u2019t have that power. He tried to make a case that a blow-out in the cost of the Fed\u2019s Washington headquarters provided a \u201ccause\u201d to fire Powell, but that effort fizzled. He has nominated Stephen Miran, the chairman of his council of economic advisers and a man who has said the president should be able to hire and fire Fed governors, to fill a vacant seat on the central bank\u2019s board. Now, even as Powell delivered his address at Jackson Hole, Trump called for the resignation of a sitting Fed governor, Lisa Cook, and threatened to fire her after the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, Bill Pulte, alleged she had committed mortgage fraud.\n\nCook, whose term doesn\u2019t expire until 2038, has said she won\u2019t be \u201cbullied\u201d into resigning \u201cbecause of some questions raised in a tweet.\u201d It is unclear, even if the allegation were proven, whether it would be serious enough to provide \u201ccause\u201d for her removal or whether Trump has the authority to fire a board member of a quasi private institution. Nevertheless, the attack on Cook (using mortgage fraud allegations that Pulte has also deployed against other Trump adversaries like Democrat Adam Schiff and New York Attorney-General Letitia James) is, with the nomination of Miran, a clear signal that Trump isn\u2019t going to abandon his efforts to gain influence over the Fed and its decision-making. If Miran is confirmed by Congress, there will be three Trump-appointed people on the Fed\u2019s seven-member board of governors. If he could force Cook out, there\u2019d be a majority of Trump appointees. The board doesn\u2019t make interest rate decisions \u2013 those are made by the 12 members of the Open Market Committee, which includes the seven board members, the president of the New York Fed and four of the other 11 regional Fed presidents \u2013 but a strong Trump representation within those meetings could be intimidating, particularly as it is the Fed\u2019s board that has the power to approve, or disapprove, the appointment of regional Fed presidents.",

        "text": "Melbourne Coach Simon Goodwin is already out, and there could be other high-profile exits to come. Christian Petracca and Clayton Oliver \u2013 who are both on contracts worth more than a million dollars a year \u2013 were both keen for a fresh start last year. The Demons refused to consider trading them in 2024, so it will be interesting to see if Petracca and Oliver try to move again \u2013 and if list boss Tim Lamb softens his stance with a new coach on the way. There is nothing to the Petracca-Hawthorn whispers at this stage. Young defender Judd McVee is looking around, and has interest from the two WA clubs, while Adelaide also raised his name internally, as he weighs up whether to stay in red and blue. The other player whose name came up in trade speculation is forward Bayley Fritsch. They are among the clubs to have shown interest in Marcus Windhager, but his preference is to remain at St Kilda if they improve their financial offer. Giant Wade Derksen is on Melbourne\u2019s radar, potentially as a delisted free agent. Could Christian Petracca follow Simon Goodwin in leaving Melbourne? Credit: AFL Photos North Melbourne The Kangaroos want to add some defensive steel to their mostly young midfield brigade, and have identified Saint Marcus Windhager as the man who could do that. They have presented a five-year contract offer with serious financial terms to Windhager\u2019s management, and have as good a chance as any suitor if he chooses to depart. That said, Windhager\u2019s preference is to continue playing with his close friend Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera at St Kilda. No.4 draft pick Zane Duursma has had an inauspicious first two seasons in the AFL, averaging only seven disposals and kicking 13 goals in 23 matches. North have no intention to move him on, regardless of how frustrated he might be. Will Phillips and Bailey Scott are worth monitoring as two players who spent most of the season out of the senior side.\n\nLoading Port Adelaide Like crosstown rivals Adelaide, the Power missed out on Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera\u2019s signature. They have a decision to make on ex-Hawk Ryan Burton, who has struggled with injuries and is no longer a first-choice defender at Alberton. Burton is highly unlikely to be involved in a trade: his fate will likely be re-signing with Port, or signing elsewhere as a delisted free agent (assuming he lands at a third club). Giant Jacob Wehr is one player they are monitoring. The biggest priority is retaining midfield star Zak Butters, who is a restricted free agent next year. The Power have presented him with a new-age deal, where he can re-sign for two years \u2013 taking him to unrestricted free agency \u2013 then have the option to tack on six more. A conga line of Victorian clubs are interested in bringing Butters back to his home state, but don\u2019t expect a resolution in the next two months. Richmond There won\u2019t be a repeat of last year\u2019s big-name departures (Shai Bolton, Daniel Rioli, Liam Baker and co.), with the Tigers instead set to work on the margins as their rebuild continues. They are among the clubs chasing out-of-favour Suns goalsneak Malcolm Rosas, while they have told veteran winger Kamdyn McIntosh he won\u2019t be offered a contract for 2026. Jacob Koschitzke is unlikely to score a new contract at Richmond, but is among the defensive depth options the Giants are sifting through. Jacob Blight fell just short of his contract trigger, and might attract interest elsewhere. Perhaps, the most fascinating situation to monitor is whether Richmond keep the North Melbourne pick they secured during last year\u2019s draft. Free agency compensation, academy and father-son selections, as well as a potential, albeit unlikely, West Coast priority pick, could push it deep into the top 10 in a weaker draft than recent years.\n\nSt Kilda The Saints are preparing for a club-defining off-season after making Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera the league\u2019s first $2 million man. They upped their seven-year offer for Carlton ruckman Tom De Koning to about $1.8 million-a-year, as this masthead reported on Wednesday, while they are in the box seat for GWS defender Leek Aleer, who is seeking greater opportunity. St Kilda have also positioned themselves as favourites for contracted West Coast forward Liam Ryan if he departs. The Saints will take advantage of salary cap rules to pay above the limit to accommodate the incoming talent, but there may be some losses. North Melbourne have offered Marcus Windhager a five-year deal, while Melbourne and Essendon have also expressed interest. Contracted ruckman Rowan Marshall has a call to make with De Koning\u2019s impending arrival, and Geelong are a possible destination. Captain Jack Steele will probably remain at Moorabbin, barring a late twist. Marcus Windhager\u2019s future at St Kilda remains uncertain after the Saints retained Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera (left) as they prepare to bring in Leek Aleer and Tom De Koning (both right) Credit: Matt Davidson Sydney The Swans plan to be aggressive in the player movement period after a rare September off, with dual Coleman medallist Charlie Curnow linked to them. However, coach Dean Cox said this week they had not spoken to the star Blue. Curnow, who raised the possibility mid-season of a move to Gold Coast, is contracted at Carlton until the end of 2029, so a lot would have to happen for him to follow Tony Lockett, Barry Hall and Lance Franklin as a marquee forward recruit for Sydney. The Swans inquired about troubled Western Bulldog Jamarra Ugle-Hagan, but have reportedly cooled on the idea of bringing him in. The Ugle-Hagan situation remains delicate. They still have work to do to retain Jake Lloyd and back-up ruckman Peter Ladhams, and have decisions to make on veterans Dane Rampe, Robbie Fox and Joel Hamling. Cox also made clear that Ollie Florent \u2013 who spent significant time in the VFL this year \u2013 was under contract and a required player. Sydney have liked Sun Malcolm Rosas for years, and this could be the time they finally secure him.\n\nLoading West Coast The Eagles are primed for a big off-season after a second wooden spoon finish in three seasons, and four straight years in the bottom three. They will lose restricted free agent Oscar Allen to Brisbane, but would gain the No.2 draft pick as compensation, while Liam Ryan (contracted until 2026) is weighing up a move to Victoria, with St Kilda the likeliest destination. Speculation continues about Harley Reid, but any decision on his future is not expected to occur this year. Uncontracted speedster Jack Petruccelle is another to watch. West Coast would love to bring Brisbane premiership defender Brandon Starcevich home, and are in a tug-of-war with Adelaide for another Lion, Callum Ah Chee. They also expressed interest in Docker Neil Erasmus, veteran Cat Mitch Duncan and Giant Wade Derksen. The Eagles have long held interest in Deven Robertson, who could aid their midfield depth. Western Bulldogs Coach Luke Beveridge previously hinted at his disenchantment with his key defensive stocks, but was blatant about it after the Dogs\u2019 round 24 defeat to Fremantle. He even mentioned they will see what is available in the \u201cmarket\u201d, so watch this space, given they already met with Jack Silvagni. That followed Beveridge subbing out Jedd Busslinger in the third quarter to go smaller despite acknowledging they were struggling with the Dockers\u2019 talls. Veteran Liam Jones played just once after round six, while mid-sized backman Buku Khamis is exploring his options after not playing in the Bulldogs\u2019 past eight matches. There is also fascination about midfielder Adam Treloar, whose physical issues mean the Dogs are yet to a new contract for him. Along with Silvagni, they have registered their interest in young Docker Neil Erasmus, while Gold Coast\u2019s Alex Davies is someone they inquired about in the past.",

        "text": "This practice rocketed during the pandemic, and in 2022 60 per cent of employees said they thought they were being monitored at work, according to a survey by the TUC union. The proportion of employers tracking workers is expected to rise to 70 per cent by 2025, the management consultancy Gartner found. Bosses have used surveillance software to check on staff with keystroke logging, screen monitoring, time tracking and chat monitoring. These programs, some of which take screenshots of workers\u2019 computers, can crack the tactics used by employees, such as running hours-long Powerpoint presentations. Some software offers the ability to log into an employee\u2019s device remotely. Credit: Michele Mossop Some businesses use software that can take photos of employees via their laptop every few minutes and use their webcam to monitor them. Others offer \u201cproductivity scores\u201d on workers, depending on their activity levels. Those mouse jigglers can also be outwitted by software because the cursor activity doesn\u2019t look normal. Algorithms can also see when a mouse is active over the same web page for hours at a time. Teramind, a software firm that can identify repetitive cursor movements, found that out of one million employees sampled, 7 per cent appeared to be faking activity at work. This year, one American bank fired more than a dozen of its workers for pretending to work.\n\nSome software also offers the ability to log into an employee\u2019s device remotely or track an employee\u2019s tone and mood, and judge how useful their conversations are. One such program, Aware, can sync with popular workplace chat tools, such as Slack, to check the conversations of specific employees. It also claims to use artificial intelligence to track employee sentiment and monitor for certain behaviours. Loading Starbucks, AstraZeneca and Nestle all use software to monitor chats, which can also identify bullying, harassment and apparent discrimination. Elsewhere, one major consultancy company checks the IP address of remote workers to check they are not \u201cworking from the beach\u201d. Employers that want staff back in the office are also using programs to monitor attendance. PwC, which has asked employees to go back three days a week, said it will track where its staff work to enforce the rules. Outfoxing bosses\n\nSome staff are already taking matters into their own hands \u2013 and their tactics are getting more hi-tech. A finance sector worker told The Telegraph that they, having some systems literacy, were able to bypass surveillance software by finding out which processes it tracked and looking for holes. \u201cIf the software only surveils processes called \u201cchrome.exe\u201d, \u201copera.exe\u201d, \u201cfirefox.exe\u201d you make a copy, rename it \u201cexcel.exe\u201d or something and you\u2019re good to go,\u201d they said. Others have been able to bypass the top-end software, which might surveil keywords and take screenshots, by creating a virtual machine on the work computer which is untrackable. Labour\u2019s promise to strengthen employment rights could affect this kind of surveillance software, by ensuring that bosses negotiate with staff and unions over its usage. Already, a patchwork of legislation, from GDPR to Employment Rights Act provisions, place limits on what bosses can do when it comes to digital surveillance. Does this software actually work? Amit Raj, founder of the Links Guys, who runs a fully remote company and uses tracking software, says even the most intricate tracking software wouldn\u2019t be able to account for some remote staff\u2019s get-out-of-work ploys.\n\n\u201cThere will always be some people who don\u2019t work. While I\u2019m not worried about employees watching YouTube for a few minutes, you can\u2019t really track someone if they\u2019re watching something on a second device and not working.\u201d This hasn\u2019t stopped Raj from looking into how to ensure staff stay on track. The software he uses to surveil staff, apart from senior hires, includes activity tracking, screenshots, time tracking, and the ability to check breaks. He describes how this software\u2019s screenshot application has caught someone who just kept a work program open all day without doing much. But this requires an investigation with HR to confirm if that worker was actually doing anything, and he questions how useful some of the tracking software is. \u201cIt can\u2019t tell you if they\u2019re actually on a computer,\u201d he says. Raj also uses surveillance software at the interview stage, to catch out jobseekers using so-called \u201cvirtual candidates\u201d or ChatGPT to complete tasks. Of course, there are limits. Experts in HR worry surveillance might end up with unproductive consequences, impacting innovation, and sparking burnout and affecting wellbeing too. Others have questioned if they can truly track how work, well, works. Do they take into account paper notes, meetings, having to use the toilet?",

Heather took an active interest in their lives and created activities that would bring them together. Family events are no longer the same. A very important member of our family is missing. Heather was also a fellow traveller with me in the way of Jesus, along with many other people. She took her faith very seriously. It shaped her life and the way that she lived. Heather was full of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness and self-control. All the fruits of the spirit of Jesus living in her, we encouraged each other and urged each other on to love God and love our neighbours as ourselves. Convicted triple-murderer Erin Patterson arriving at the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne on Monday. Credit: Jason Edwards She had a particular compassion for strugglers and disadvantaged people, and that was reflected in the teaching, mentoring work she chose to do when she re-entered the workforce after our children had reached secondary age.\n\nI could go on; there\u2019s so much more that deserves to be said about Heather. It\u2019s one of the distressing shortcomings of our society that so much attention is showered on those who do evil and so little on those who do good. The greatest impact of Erin\u2019s actions on me has been to deprive me of Heather\u2019s company and Heather\u2019s important place in our family \u2013 the silence in our home is a daily reminder. I continue to carry a heavy burden of grief over her untimely death. It\u2019s a truly horrible thought to live with, that somebody could decide to take her life. I only feel half alive without her. My consolation is that we will be reunited in the resurrection and the age to come. In a similar vein, the second-heaviest impact on me has been the loss of Don and Gail. They were the next two closest people to me, after Heather and our family, and again, they were good and solid people. No doubt their families will say more about them, but I would like to acknowledge their good character and their constructive influence on my life. Our families grew up together. They were all so serious about following Jesus, and we encouraged and supported each other for about 50 years. My life is greatly impoverished without them. I have suffered severe personal impacts from Erin\u2019s actions.\n\nI very, very nearly died. It has taken me the best part of two years for my health and strength to recover to the point that I have. I praise God for my miraculous healing, and I thank the many medical professionals who strived to save all four of us. They threw everything into our care. I joke that I know this because I have a bump on the back of my head from the kitchen sink. It\u2019s a grief to them that Heather, Gail and Don died. Although I\u2019ve made a good recovery, my health has never returned to the levels I had before the fateful lunch. I have reduced kidney function, ongoing respiratory issues and reduced energy, and I\u2019ve had to face the many challenges of re-establishing life without Heather. The challenge has vastly changed \u2026 I\u2019m suddenly single. The heartbreak of having to wind up her affairs. Returning to pastoral work without her help and sage advice. Unsettled sleep. Nobody to share in life\u2019s daily tasks, which has taken much of the joy out of pottering around the house and the garden. Nobody to debrief with at the end of the day. The impacts are so many and varied, some big and a myriad of small things, that no list could ever contain them. Loading I\u2019m distressed that Erin has acted with callous and calculated disregard for my life and the lives of those I love. What foolishness possesses a person to think that murder could be the solution to their problems, especially the murder of people who had only good intentions towards her? Erin has brought deep sorrow and grief into my life and the lives of many others, the ripples spread out through family, friends, our church, congregation, the local community and beyond.",

        "text": "He was a seven-time NBL most valuable player (the trophy is named in his honour), and 14-time scoring champion, winning championships in 1993 and 1997. He was a first-team All-NBL player for a record 15 straight seasons, and averaged a phenomenal 30.8 points per game through a stunning career. Gaze led the Boomers to five Olympics, and was the flag bearer and overall team captain at the 2000 Sydney Games. The award for the best Australian international player of the year is the Gaze Medal. In 2013, he joined his father Lindsay, the godfather of Australian basketball, in the FIBA Hall of Fame. All this from a boy who literally grew up at the old Albert Park Basketball Stadium, where Lindsay was the general manager and the family lived in the attached residence. Gaze fell just short of an Olympic medal. The Boomers finished fourth three times (1988, \u201996 and 2000) during his time. The bronze medal loss to Lithuania at the Atlanta Games in \u201996, when star centre Arvydas Sabonis nailed two big three pointers, still hurts. Had the Australians had Luc Longley available through the tournament \u2013 the towering centre had been asked by the Chicago Bulls to have ankle surgery \u2013 a maiden men\u2019s basketball medal may have been within reach.\n\n\u201cThose moments are of what-ifs, or if only had he [Sabonis] missed a couple of those, it might have been a different outcome,\u201d Gaze said. Those were the days: Melbourne Tigers\u2019 greats Mark Bradtke, Andrew Gaze and Lanard Copeland. Credit: Fairfax Photographic The teary emotions Gaze had on national television when that drought was finally broken at the 2021 Olympics in Tokyo highlighted how much the Boomers still mean to him, a legacy of growing up around the team when his father was coach. \u201cThe thing that sticks out the most for me, I cast back to when I was a youngster, and the Australian team, the values around the team, and playing for Australia, and competing at the Olympic Games, and the spirit of the games, they were instilled in me because of my dad and, because of that, all my dreams as a youngster were Australian team and Olympic centric,\u201d Gaze said. \u201cUnlike today, where you can just jump on your phone, or watch it on television, access to college basketball, NBA, European basketball was basically non-existent.\u201d\n\nGaze remains arguably the greatest shooter this country has produced, his classical technique making him and Brazilian great Oscar Schmidt as feared as any US star when it came to the Olympics, where Schmidt and Gaze still sit one and two for most career points, and the world championships. Loading In the late 1980s, The Age ran weekly sketches of instructional training and technique advice from Gaze, who remembers these fondly. It was an idea ahead of its time, this type of information now the domain of social media and the innumerable so-called basketball experts the sport breeds. Gaze\u2019s one season with US college Seton Hall University in 1988-89, when the Pirates had a Cinderella run to the NCAA final, losing in overtime to the Michigan Wolverines, with Gaze starting in all games, sparked live coverage of the games in Australia, and extensive media exposure. He narrowly missed an NBA contract with the Seattle Supersonics. He was a pioneer in playing professionally in Europe, and his time in the NBA initially came with a stint with the then Washington Bullets in 1994. There was another with the 1998-99 San Antonio Spurs, but he did not suit up as a member of the actual playing squad through the play-offs en route to their title. Still, he received a championship ring. His perimeter shooting, and ability to space the floor, would have been ideal in the modern game.\n\n\u201cI had my opportunities, I got a taste of it, but there were some ... decisions that I made during that period of time, if I had thrown myself out there a bit more, perhaps been a bit more aggressive at exploring opportunities, things might have been different, but not different enough that I have any regrets,\u201d Gaze said. Gaze coached in the NBL with the Sydney Kings from 2016-19, and revealed a desire to still coach at the top level in Australia, or abroad, potentially in Asia, where opportunities beckon. Cricketing great urges caution over privatisation bid Australian cricket great Belinda Clark has urged the sport\u2019s authorities to retain a country-over-club mantra when it comes to debating privatisation of women\u2019s Twenty20 cricket.\n\nA report by the Boston Consulting Group has listed alternative forms of investment and ownership, including privatisation, of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Big Bash Leagues for Cricket Australia to consider in a bid to help strengthen the standing of the two competitions, and attract the extra funds needed to lure the world\u2019s best players, particularly in the men\u2019s league. CA, state associations and other key figures are debating the report, but Clark \u2013 a former senior CA executive and interim chief executive officer who on Monday was elevated to legend status in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame \u2013 said caution was required when it came to ensuring the women\u2019s program, including its pathways, continued to grow. Great honour: Cricketing great Belinda Clark has been elevated to legend status in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. Credit: Paul Harris \u201cI think it [privatisation] is definitely worth exploring appropriately. Whether it\u2019s privatised or not, I think the key issue for the sport is how it balances the international game and the domestic game. If you throw all that league cricket into the domestic bucket, it\u2019s really challenging,\u201d Clark said. \u201cI think the women\u2019s game has done a pretty good job so far of balancing those two things. I think the men\u2019s game has a challenge on its hands, but I think it\u2019s important that the lens we look through for both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s game is specific for them, and I think the women have the chance to get the balance right.\n\nLoading \u201cThe men are in a position where they are trying to balance it. It\u2019s something that has got to be a bit of give and take, whereas the women aren\u2019t at that point. It\u2019s really important that we keep international cricket as the premier competition. \u201cWhat that does is it allows you to grow the game globally, these domestic leagues won\u2019t allow you to do that in the same way. You don\u2019t get the opportunities unless you are at the top of the tree to be playing in the domestic comps. I feel a really strong sense that this game should have opportunities for everyone, that we do need international cricket at all of its levels to continue to expand and provide people with the chance to play.\u201d Clark, 54, has played an instrumental role in the rise of women\u2019s cricket, as a player, captain and administrator, who now runs her own leadership company. Already with a swag of honours, Clark has been bestowed another by the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 2011 as an athlete member.\n\nLoading \u201cI feel a mix of gratitude, humbleness, just amazed that it has all led to this,\u201d Clark said. A superb leader and one of the finest batters of her generation, Clark was captain of the Australian women\u2019s team for 11 years from 1993, and won World Cups in 1997 and 2005. She still retains the record for most runs (4844 at an average of 47.49) by an Australian woman in ODIs, ahead of Karen Rolton and Meg Lanning, and has captained the most matches (101) with an 83 per cent winning record. She was the first woman to score a double century in a one-day international. \u201cI am really proud the sport has moved along to where there is so much cricket going on now, both ODIs and T20s in particular. Which is why it lends itself to becoming a professional sport, because you are playing a lot,\u201d Clark said.\n\nClark was the first woman inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame and the second in the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. In 2023, a statue of Clark was unveiled outside the members\u2019 entrance to the Sydney Cricket Ground. \u201cI often get people sending me pictures of them with it, and I just love it. That\u2019s fun and I enjoy that,\u201d Clark said. Her legend status in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame caps a remarkable journey for a woman who grew up in Newcastle where her father, Allan, was an excellent local cricketer, while mother Margaret was a state tennis champion. Clark dreamt of winning Wimbledon, and idolised John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova. \u201cI still take an interest. I think tennis is a great sport, particularly as a kid, it teaches you tactics, it teaches you movement, it teaches you to be self-reliant, there is no one out there with you \u2026 you are umpiring yourselves, so there is an element of being able to call a game yourself,\u201d Clark said.\n\n\u201cI really loved the game, but it just got to a point where cricket became a passion, it became the sport I loved the most.\u201d Clark turned to cricket at 13 when at Newcastle High School, and later played district cricket in Sydney for Gordon. She debuted for Australia in an ODI in 1991, and a fortnight later posted a century on Test debut against India at North Sydney Oval. Clark was made Australian captain in 1993 after a disappointing World Cup sparked change. She was a key figure in the World Cup win in India in \u201997, top-scoring with 52 in a low-scoring final against New Zealand. Her 970 runs that year remains a calendar year ODI record in the women\u2019s game. There was more World Cup glory in 2005, when the Australians edged India in the final. Clark retired later that year, her 15 Tests reaping 919 runs at 45.95. So great has contribution been to the sport that the Australian women\u2019s international player of the year is awarded the Belinda Clark Medal, as is the NSW Breakers\u2019 player of the year in the women\u2019s national cricket league.",

If you get rid of net zero, you are saying climate change is not real and you do not need to do anything about it. ... Now our opponents are having a debate, and they have one on the weekend at the LNP conference, we had the leader of the opposition come along and be repudiated by more than 90 per cent of members at that LNP conference.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nData released by Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen found Australia is tracking well to meet its 2030 target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43 per cent from 2005 levels.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nRetirees should continue to receive concessional tax treatment on their superannuation, Treasurer Jim Chalmers says, despite growing pressure for broader tax reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking after a three-day productivity roundtable in Canberra, Dr Chalmers says fairness for younger generations must be part of future tax discussions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile feedback from the summit would shape upcoming budgets, he's told the ABC there are no plans to change tax concessions for retirees\u2019 super balances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey still deserve concessional treatment to encourage people to be in superannuation, and that\u2019s not something we are proposing to change. ... We acknowledge that there are issues in superannuation and tax, and that's why two and a half years ago, I proposed what is a pretty modest change, but a meaningful change which makes the system a bit more sustainable, but still maintains an element of concessionality when it comes to tax treatment and super.\u201d\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Albanese government is set to bring forward the expansion of a scheme allowing first home buyers to put down a deposit of as little as five per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile previous iterations of the initiative had a yearly cap on participants, the scheme will now be open to all home buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally slated for implementation in January 2026, the expanded scheme will begin rolling out from October.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the scheme, a first home buyer looking to purchase a property at the national median price of $844,000 would only need a $42,200 deposit.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing minister Clare O'Neil says it is clear young people need greater access to the property market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This policy is going to have a hugely meaningful impact for the people who choose to use it. What we know is that it is incredibly challenging for this younger generation to get into home ownership. We are seeing young people having to save 8 or 9 years to build a deposit. With the 5 per cent deposit program that our government is expanding, we see that timeline brought back to two or three years.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nIran\u2019s Supreme Leader has declared the standoff with the United States unsolvable, insisting Tehran will never submit to US demands over its nuclear program.\n\n\n\n\n\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s remarks follow the suspension of nuclear talks with Washington after US and Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites during a 12-day war in June.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough Iran and European powers agreed last week to resume discussions aimed at reviving full negotiations, France, Britain, and Germany have warned they could trigger further UN sanctions if Iran refuses to re-engage.\n\n\n\n\n\nWestern governments maintain Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons, a claim Iran rejects, saying it only wants nuclear energy.\n\n\n\n\n\nAyatollah Khamenei accuses the US of disrespecting Iranian sovereignty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis issue of negotiation with America is unsolvable.

        "text": "All first home buyers in Australia will be able to get on the property ladder with a lower deposit sooner, as a federal scheme kicks in earlier than scheduled.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government's expansion of the First Homebuyer Guarantee will allow all first-home buyers to put down a deposit of 5 per cent, and will start rolling out from 1 October, three months earlier than its original start time of January 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe earlier start date for the scheme would reduce hurdles to entering the property market, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to help young people and first home buyers achieve the dream of home ownership sooner,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bringing the start date of our 5 per cent deposit scheme will do just that, getting more Australians into their home quicker, while saving money along the way.\"\n\n\n\nWhat is the first home buyer scheme?\n\nThe scheme allows first-home buyers to buy a property with a smaller 5 per cent deposit, compared to the usual 20 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government acts as guarantor and contributes the remaining 15 per cent of a deposit, allowing buyers to avoid taking out costly lenders' mortgage insurance.\n\n\n\nWhat changes are coming to the scheme?\n\nWhile the scheme isn't new, it will be expanded from 1 October to all first-home buyers \u2014 after previous versions had a yearly cap on the number of participants.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, there will no longer be income limits for participants' eligibility for the scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice caps for eligible homes in the scheme in almost all jurisdictions will also be raised from October.\n\n\n\nHousing Minister Clare O'Neil said the scheme would make access to home ownership fairer. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas In Sydney, the cap will increase from $900,000 to $1.5 million, in Brisbane it will increase from $700,000 to $1 million, and in Melbourne it will increase from $800,000 to $950,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's estimated 70,000 people are expected to use the home guarantee scheme in its first year of expanded access, 20,000 more than the current yearly cap.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing Minister Clare O'Neil said the scheme would make access to home ownership more equitable by \"levelling the playing field\", particularly for younger people entering the property market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's just not right that an entire generation of young Australians have been locked out of the housing market, saving for decades while paying off someone else's mortgage.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's been the reaction to it?\n\nThe Housing Industry Association (HIA), the country's peak national industry association for the residential construction and development industry, welcomed the expansion.\n\n\n\n\n\nHIA managing director Jocelyn Martin said: \"This promises to open doors for more people and is an important boost for aspirational home buyers in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This will make homeownership more accessible to those who may have previously been locked out of the market.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Property Council of Australia said bringing forward the scheme would help more first-home buyers bridge the deposit gap and enter the market.\n\n\n\nBut CEO Mike Zorbas said on Monday the scheme design would need to be carefully reviewed on a regular basis from mid-2026 \"to ensure key housing markets do not overheat\".\n\n\n\n\n\nEverybody's Home, a national campaign aimed at addressing Australia's housing crisis, partially through increased social housing, said the scheme was \"good for some\" but was \"not a solution to the housing affordability crisis for all\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The real solution to Australia's housing crisis is to bring down the cost of housing for everybody through measures including tax reform and more social housing,\" spokesperson Maiy Azize said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Too many Australians are locked out of home ownership because they are stuck in a rental market that makes it extremely difficult to save.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To tackle the housing crisis, the federal government must make major investments in social housing; these are low-cost rentals that are guaranteed to remain affordable. Australia already faces a social housing shortfall of 640,000 homes, and that gap is only widening.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition housing spokesperson Andrew Bragg was critical of the scheme being open to all first-home buyers without any income testing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is an uncapped scheme which is available to billionaires, or the children of billionaires, if they want to use a government program,\" he told ABC radio on Monday morning, warning of taxpayers \"underwriting mortgage insurance schemes for extremely wealthy people\".\n\n\n\nWhat other changes are coming to housing?\n\nThe scheme's earlier start date comes as upcoming changes to the national construction code were paused to allow for homes to be built quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code will be put on hold until 2029, with the exception of safety standards, which have been touted as reducing complexity for workers in the construction industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pause follows the federal government's productivity roundtable, which also led to the fast-tracking of environmental approvals for more than 26,000 homes.\n\n\n\n",

Everyone's business is going down.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The shop opposite us just closed. They probably couldn't bear it anymore.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far, there's no real evidence Thai authorities have started enforcing the new regulations, but Suradeth says the fear they will has scared most of his customers away.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe used to sell more than $7,000 worth of cannabis every month. Last month, it dropped to less than $500.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We paid 5,000 baht ($240) to the government for a licence, but once we get that licence, they release new regulations and tell us the one we have is useless,\" Suradeth says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sure, you can hire a doctor, but the cost is very high, and not every doctor wants to work in a cannabis shop.\"\n\n\n\nThe governmental feud fuelling recriminalisation\n\nThailand's health minister says the reforms are about improving public safety and addressing rising cannabis addiction, but analysts say they are also wound up in Thailand's latest political crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June, former Cambodian leader Hun Sen leaked the audio from a controversial phone call with Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra , during which she appeared to make disparaging remarks about her own military's handling of the recent border crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer political allies in the Bhumjaithai Party, which was the main driving force behind cannabis decriminalisation, withdrew from the coalition in outrage.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin a week, Shinawatra's Pheu Thai Party had moved to recriminalise the drug .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reversal on cannabis \"has a lot to do with coalition dynamics and coalition politics,\" political analyst Thitinan Pongsudhirak from Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The cannabis policy in Thailand is synonymous with the Bhumjaithai Party. It wanted to broaden its political base by decriminalising cannabis. So, suddenly, you had these cannabis shops mushrooming around Thailand, especially in Bangkok,\" he says.\n\n\n\nThe Thai government has flagged plans to cut cannabis shop numbers back almost 90 per cent to 2,000 and require each one to have a doctor on site. Source: SBS News The industry experienced near-instant economic success; its value was already estimated above $1 billion, with the Thai Chamber of Commerce predicting that number could rise to $1.8 billion by the end of this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalysts believe tourists were behind much of the enthusiasm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think there was a public backlash against it,\" Pongsudhirak says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The constituencies in favour of cannabis were limited; some vendors, proprietors, tourists, the hospitality industry. But the public sentiments at large are very sceptical. The Thais, being a predominantly Buddhist country, still frowned upon vices like this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThailand's public health minister Somsak Thepsuthin says he eventually wants to relist cannabis as a category five narcotic, which would result in tougher penalties for recreational use and possession, including jail time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to tell tourists they are welcome to enjoy Thailand's culture and nature, but Thailand should not be seen as a destination for recreational cannabis use,\" Thepsuthin recently said. \"It affects children, causes nuisance from unwanted odours.\"\n\n\n\nAn industry moving underground\n\nWith the new restrictions widely unenforced and more regulations on the way, the industry has settled into a grey zone for now.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose trying to keep their businesses open say there is little clarity and a lot of confusion.\n\n\n\nKitty Chopaka says cannabis dispensary owners are reporting a rise in tourists selling the drug to other tourists, suggesting the billion-dollar business is now moving underground. Source: SBS News \"The health department is coming out with one set of information, the provinces are coming out with another set of information, when a lot of things are actually still on the drawing board,\" Kitty Chopaka from advocacy group Writing Thailand's Cannabis Future says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The shops in the provinces where the health officers happen to be strict, they are now either shut down, or are being told 'We suggest you shut down until the rules are more concrete, but if you don't shut down we will come and do a little inspection where we're then probably able to suspend your licence'.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChopaka has been speaking with a network of dispensary owners almost daily as they try to navigate the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have consistently been reporting a drop in sales since the prescription rules came into effect, but they do not believe that correlates with a drop in usage. Many believe tourists are now buying the drug from other tourists instead of the dispensaries.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the 18,000 registered shops have begun shutting down, while others are holding out to see if they might be one of the few that get to stay in business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of the small businesses are going to get removed, the small farms, the ones where the husband is the grower, the wife is the trimmer, then maybe the mother-in-law is the seller at the shop. Those guys are not going to exist anymore,\" Chopaka says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would say one small business is about ten lives you're dealing with. You've got the owner, the farms, the people who work in the shop, all of the production side of things. Each of them will have a family. And you times it by 18,000 \u2014 that's a lot of people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says: \"That's the sad part.\"\n\n\n\n",

The code normally updates every three years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe freeze excludes essential safety and quality changes and maintains the strong residential standards adopted in 2022, including 7-star energy efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government will use the pause to streamline the code, including improving its usability with artificial intelligence, removing barriers and encouraging modern methods of construction, such as prefab and modular housing, and improving how code additions are developed.\n\n\n\nJim Chalmers confirmed alterations to the national code at last week's productivity summit. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas Removing building red tape to speed up housing construction won't cut corners on standards, Housing Minister Clare O'Neil said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's too hard to build a home in this country. We want builders on site, not filling in forms to get their approval,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government will also fast-track environmental assessment applications for more than 26,000 homes by creating a specialised environment department team, prioritising robust development applications.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also looking to use AI tools to simplify and hasten approvals.\n\n\n\n\"Piloting an AI program to help users navigate the volumes of codes and standards will add significant value, allowing more time to build homes and potentially reducing paperwork,\" Housing Industry Association director Jocelyn Martin said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Minister Murray Watt said fast-tracked projects will still need to meet all environmental requirements, but developers will be incentivised to provide required information up front.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This approach will ensure strong national environmental protections, while also leading to faster decision making, more certainty for industry and more homes for Australians,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving impediments for superannuation investment in new housing and working with the states and territories to accelerate planning, zoning and approvals are also slated under the changes.\n\n\n\n\"We want builders on site, not filling in forms to get their approval,\" Housing Minister Clare O'Neil said.

        "text": "In schoolyards and dance clubs across the country, Australians are embracing a genre-bending animated film centred around a K-pop girl band that secretly fights demons.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Netflix original KPop Demon Hunters has become an unlikely worldwide phenomenon, including in Australia, and is now the second most popular English-language movie globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the nine weeks since its premiere on 21 June, it has racked up 210 million views and is second only to action comedy film Red Notice on the screener's list of most popular movies. It's the first animated movie to enter the list.\n\n\n\nThe animated film KPop Demon Hunters follows a girl band called Huntr/x. Source: Supplied / Netflix In Australia, KPop Demon Hunters is currently the number one film on Netflix and has spent nine weeks in the top 10.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's become so popular that singalong screenings are being held in Hoyts cinemas across the country this weekend.\n\n\n\nWhat is KPop Demon Hunters about?\n\nThe English-language animated musical is a vibrant introduction to the world of K-pop and follows the lives of girl group Huntr/x, whose soaring vocals help keep demons away.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe music drives much of the film's appeal, and the soundtrack has been the number one album on the ARIA charts in Australia for five non-consecutive weeks. The song Golden has also topped the Top 50 Singles, securing a rare ARIA chart double.\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected and co-written by Maggie Kang, who was born in South Korea and grew up in Canada, the film was inspired by Kang's love of K-pop.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why Australians are getting hooked on Korean TV\n\n\"I have been a fan of these incredible artists and their work for many years, so it's a dream come true to have original songs written and produced for our film by legendary talent such as The Black Label [a leading South Korean record label],\" Kang says.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sung-Ae Lee, an expert in Asian cinema at Macquarie University, describes the film's blend of fast-paced visuals as channelling \"global energy\".\n\n\n\n\n\nShe points to its incorporation of K-pop culture, which thrives online, and says it reflects young people's use of social media platforms such as TikTok and YouTube, as well as its fan communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's kind of a turning point ... it's a really innovative idea of K-pop idols plus this fantasy genre,\" she says.\n\n\n\nKPop Demon Hunters follows the lives of K-pop superstars Rumi, Mira and Zoey, who use their secret identities as demon hunters to protect their fans from a supernatural threat. Source: Supplied / Netflix While Lee believes the success of the music, which is performed by real singers, is connected to its narrative context within the film, others have suggested it also demonstrates the potential for animated bands, possibly driven by artificial intelligence , to achieve chart success.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuk-Young Kim, a professor at the University of California, told the Wall Street Journal the film's success shows it's possible for fans to connect with nonhuman idols.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a long-running dream for K-pop companies,\" Kim said. \"Here we have idols who never sleep, never get sick, never age.\"\n\n\n\nSchoolkids embrace hit film\n\nThe popularity of the film appears to have grown organically without the publicity that has helped fuel the success of other Netflix hits such as Red Notice.\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney mother Alison McLeod says she watched KPop Demon Hunters with her seven-year-old daughter after it was recommended by the Netflix algorithm.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 44-year-old says the film reminded her of the Japanese manga series Astro Boy and other animations she watched as a child.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had friends that were into manga and definitely into K-pop music ... I knew a little bit about the genre and what to expect. And it just looked fun,\" McLeod tells SBS News.\n\n\n\nWhat I really liked once we started watching it was the themes ... the girl power.\n\n\"It embraces the [non] typical girl \u2014 these three girls are different. They just presented as really good role models for my little one, she's fiesty.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHer daughter now re-enacts scenes from the movie with her friends at school, and McLeod says she also attended a seven-year-old's birthday party recently that featured songs from the soundtrack during a game of musical bumps (like musical statues but players sit instead of freeze).\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They were rocking out to the Demon Hunter soundtrack and every single kid there knew all the words,\" she says.\n\n\n\nMcLeod says her daughter is predominantly attracted to the music, with the film's soundtrack now on daily rotation in their car and home. But she also seems to identify more with the characters than those in other films, such as Encanto and Trolls, which have been previous obsessions.\n\n\n\n\n\nMcLeod has previously dyed her hair purple and both she and her partner have tattoos \u2014 like the lead character in Demon Hunters, Rumi. She says the film is helping her daughter to embrace differences in personal style and expression as \"cool\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're not the norm in society, and I think that she [McLeod's daughter] feels like the Huntr/x girls embody that in a really cool way ... she'll [now] be like 'I can have purple hair'.\"\n\n\n\nA Hollywood film featuring Korean culture\n\nThe film has also been a hit within the Korean community and remains the top movie on Netflix in South Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I thought maybe Korean audiences [would] resist it but it was really popular and they like it,\" Lee says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think it's because it's youth culture.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLee says she didn't like KPop Demon Hunters the first time she watched it because it seemed Americanised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[While] the subject is quite Korean ... it's not Korean at all, it's actually Hollywood.\n\n\n\nThe animation is American to me \u2014 the body language and facial expression \u2014 they're all American, not Korean.\n\nShe says it's hard to pinpoint exact movements, but one example is shrugging, a common gesture in the US, and quite different to gestural conventions in Korean films.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in other ways, it incorporates culturally Korean tropes, and folklore elements that Lee found impressive.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film features a tiger and a magpie, a combination that is often seen in Korean folk paintings called Jakhodo. They symbolise good fortune and are thought to ward off evil spirits.\n\n\n\nA scene featuring a large tiger and magpie talking to the lead character Rumi. Source: Supplied / Netflix \"I was really surprised in the beginning [that] they're using it. I think it's one of the most beloved folk images [in Korean culture],\" Lee says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the boy band in the film, Saja, also has a dual meaning in Korean. It can refer to a lion, symbolising strength and courage, but can also refer to a grim reaper, a meaning that makes sense in the film as the band members are collecting souls.\n\n\n\nK-pop girl band Huntr/x must battle Saja, an irresistible rival boy band of demons in disguise. Source: Supplied / Netflix Leah Hyein Na, executive producer of the Korean program at SBS, says the Korean community in Australia is proud of the film and appreciates its meticulous depiction of Korean elements. She says her children also love the film and sing the songs with friends at school.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate professor in Korean studies at Australian National University, Roald Maliangkay, says the Korean studies community \u2014 both Korean and non-Korean \u2014 is particularly interested in how Korean folk elements have been incorporated in the film.\n\n\n\n\"I was shown an exhibition of Chosun dynasty clothes at the Korea University museum [recently] and the lady giving the tour pointed at a very old sword, noting that it was just like the one used in KPop Demon Hunters,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe song Golden was also being played everywhere during Maliangkay's recent visit to South Korea, which he says is a good indication of its popularity with foreign tourists as well.\n\n\n\nWhy is Kpop Demon Hunters so popular?\n\nWorkers at the I HEART KPOP store in Brisbane say they saw an immediate impact on sales following the film's release.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had so many parents coming in looking for any of the merch from the movie,\" store worker Aurelia says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 24-year-old says the store has always attracted a mixed demographic \u2014 across race, age and gender \u2014 but they have seen more people coming in who aren't interested in K-pop but love the film.\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent K-pop party hosted by the store in Brisbane, which usually attracts around 800 people, drew around 1,200 attendees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The crowd went very crazy for the songs from KPop Demon Hunters,\" Aurelia says.\n\n\n\nAurelia has been a fan of K-pop since 2019 after stumbling upon a video of the boy band BTS on YouTube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was really touched by the way that BTS talk about their fans, the relationship that they had between the fans and the respect that they had for them,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile she was initially sceptical of KPop Demon Hunters, she says she was happily surprised after watching it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You could see \u2014 as a K-pop fan \u2014 it was made by fans ... I thought that was awesome,\" she says.\n\n\n\nAurelia (left) is a K-pop fan and recently attended a dance party in Brisbane that drew 1,200 people. Source: Supplied / Silvana Sanchez Audrey Nuna, who voices Mira in the film, told SBS Korean that she had a feeling the movie would do well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I was recording the songs for this movie, I did tell my mum,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I was like: 'mum, I think this movie's going to do really, really well' because I think so many people have a love \u2014 even people who are not Korean \u2014 have such a love for Korean music, Korean pop, Korean culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[But] I don't think I ever could have expected it to be at this level.\"\n\n\n\nWith its themes of girl power, coming of age and youth culture, Lee says the film feels \"fresh\", and she also eventually embraced it.\n\n\n\nIt's not a typical supernatural action genre \u2014 it's quite fresh and [there's] flair to it, that's why I like it.\n\nLee believes audiences may also be drawn to its themes of self-acceptance, friendship and empowerment.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther shows featuring demon hunters, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Sailor Moon, have also been popular with Western audiences in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Generation X or even older generations, they are really interested in K-pop and things like that because they grew up with [these shows],\" Lee says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are all women warriors or girl warriors.\"\n\n\n\nMovie sparks interest in Korean culture\n\nMcLeod says her daughter is envious of her two Korean friends at school because they can understand parts of the songs that aren't translated into English.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Their school teaches Mandarin, and she was like 'I wish they taught Korean instead',\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer daughter is also now asking to go to Korean restaurants instead of her usual favourite, which is Japanese.\n\n\n\n\"I think it's great that something that's a bit of a counter culture has reached such mainstream popularity,\" McLeod says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I hope that it has opened the door for other genres.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's wild that my anglo-Australian child is into K-pop, I love that so much.\"\n\n\n\n",

He says now that so many people are already experiencing famine, regular food is not enough to save them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So when somebody is malnourished, how can they recover? Well, the answer is fairly simple. It's being provided therapeutic food. Therapeutic food is food that is completely replete with all the nutrients that are needed in ample quantities. If you had enough food in Gaza today for everyone to eat as much as they wanted, it would be three months before everyone would be recovered. But a week's worth of therapeutic food is life-saving.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael controls the flow of aid into Gaza and has dismissed the findings as biased.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkers in the childcare sector say staffing issues remain unaddressed, after Friday's meeting on childcare safety attended by state and territory ministers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ministers have agreed to establish a national register of childcare workers to be trialled and launched in early 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will also be a CCTV trial that will run at 300 centres across the country from October or November.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreeti Soodan, from the United Workers Union, says there needs to be change to ensure adequate staffing numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we talk about the under roof ratio, it is extremely important to have minimum staff, as per that licensing of the childcare centre because it leads to... It is important that it should meet the Australian quality framework. And we are just demanding for the bare minimum, which is essential for the safety and wellbeing of the children.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers of the Gurindji community in the Northern Territory are marking 50 years since the Gurindji land handback, a historic turning point for Aboriginal land rights in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter an almost decade-long struggle, in 1975 then Prime Minister Gough Whitlam poured sand into the hands of Gurindji man Vincent Lingiari - granting his people a lease to a parcel of land on the Wave Hill cattle station.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe moment paved the way for the Aboriginal Land Rights Movement \u2013 and the Northern Territory Aboriginal Land Rights Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the first time Indigenous Australians could claim land rights if they could prove traditional ownership.\n\n\n\n\n\nGurindji Elder George Edwards says the community has come together this weekend - for the annual Gurindji Freedom Day Festival - to mark the significance of that moment, and the leadership shown by Vincent Lingiari then and the historic Wave Hill Walk-off a decade earlier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He was a great leader. He was the leader of the tribe, all tribe... Mr Lingiari, he was a great man. He was a hero for me. For what he done for us, done for our people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Rugby Union, Wallaroos co-captain Emily Chancellor says the team wants to make a strong statement in their opening game against Samoa at the Women's Rugby World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe game takes place in Manchester later tonight.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's best women's World Cup finish was a third-place showing in New Zealand in 2010.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are ten Wallaroos players on their World Cup debuts - and forging strong group ties has been a focus of the preparation.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrilleen Pomare competed for Australia at the 2017 and 2021 Rugby World Cups.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says this time Australia is in it to win it.\n\n\n\n",

Got it Share\n\nOne of Sydney\u2019s most prized restaurants, the two chefs\u2019 hatted Monopole, is set to close its doors on Saturday, September 6. A particularly tough winter trade has been gruelling for many Sydney restaurants, but co-owner Brent Savage, whose Bentley Restaurant Group includes Monopole in its stable, blamed the closure on the end of a lease at the restaurant, which overlooks Australia Square. Monopole\u2019s French makeover, with linen tablecloths and flickering candles. Dion Georgopoulos Savage said the CBD restaurant trade in 2025 felt more optimistic than last year, but confirmed rumours \u2013 swirling for months \u2013 that the Monopole site had been sounding out new operators. He is unsure of its future direction, however. \u201cWe looked at all our options,\u201d Savage said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter eight years in its original location, Monopole moved from Potts Point in late 2020, later shifting from a wine bar focus to a French-leaning venue last year. \u201cWe got a good review, I feel quite proud of what we\u2019ve achieved,\u201d Savage said. But the closure isn\u2019t the only news for the group, which is one of the most expansive and successful restaurant operations in Sydney. It will double down on its CBD restaurant openings King Clarence and Eleven Barrack with another new venue \u2013 Watermans \u2013 to open at Barangaroo in spring. From left: Nick Hildebrandt, Darryl Martin and Brent Savage will open Watermans in Barangaroo. Darryl Martin, the former owner-chef at Barzaari in Marrickville, will lead the Watermans kitchen. \u201cWe\u2019re massive fans of Darryl from his Barzaari days,\u201d Savage said. Pointing to Martin\u2019s labne with salted cucumber as a dish that will make its way onto the Watermans opening menu, Savage said other dishes they\u2019ve been working on include warm hummus with green zhoug; pickled watermelon and raw tuna salad with sumac; whole roasted John Dory with chermoula; and pomegranate-glazed slow-cooked lamb shoulder with pickled radishes and black lime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSavage stressed the restaurant start-up won\u2019t be a carbon copy of Barzaari. \u201cIt\u2019ll be Darryl\u2019s repertoire with a little of our finesse,\u201d Savage said. The 120-seat restaurant will slide into the recently completed One Sydney Harbour development at Barangaroo, a precinct where the Bentley crew has plenty of experience, having operated the now-closed Cirrus Dining nearby until 2024. Monopole\u2019s duck breast, with crisp skin and rosy meat, and an orange-scented glaze. Dion Georgopoulos The expansive restaurant group isn\u2019t ruling out a return for Monopole. \u201cIf it\u2019s the right site, never say never,\u201d Savage said. He and business partner Nick Hildebrandt said in a joint statement that the team were proud of their achievements at Monopole, both in the original Potts Point location and CBD.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAn enormous amount of talent has graced both the kitchen and the floor,\u201d the statement said. \u201cMonopole was a ground-breaking wine bar when we opened it and has always pushed the envelope, holding two hats for 10 years and winning multiple awards for its wine list.\u201d Related Article Good Food hat Good Food hat 16.5 / 20 Review This two-hatted wine bar has had a French makeover \u2013 but does it have that je ne sais quoi?\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

        "text": "Then he went onto say that with policy in restrictive territory the outlook and shifting balance of risks might warrant adjusting the policy stance \u2013 i.e. a rate cut. The awkward position the Fed finds itself in is that on both sides of its mandate there are novel Donald Trump-inspired uncertainties. Ansell says price rises will offset Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on its products. Credit: AP The inflation rate, already materially above the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target rate, is picking up gradually as Trump\u2019s tariffs start to impact. Because the bulk of the globally applicable baseline tariffs only just started to come into effect this month, and US businesses had built significant pre-tariff inventories earlier in the year, they will show up progressively in the inflation rate through the rest of this year and into next year.\n\n\u201cThe effects of tariffs on consumer prices are now clearly visible,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe expect those effects to accumulate over coming months, with high uncertainty about timing and amounts. The question that matters for monetary policy is whether those price increases are likely to materially raise the risk of an ongoing inflation problem. Loading \u201cA reasonable base case is that the effects will be relatively short-lived \u2013 a one-time shift in the price level,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is also possible, however, that the upward pressure on prices from tariffs could spur a more lasting inflation dynamic, and that is a risk to be assessed and managed,\u201d he said, noting that a decline in real incomes from higher prices could see workers demanding higher wages or that the price rises could lead to a lift in inflation expectations that dragged actual inflation up.\n\nIf the impact of the tariffs on inflation is uncertain, so is the impact of Trump\u2019s immigration policies on the unemployment rate. Last month\u2019s contentious jobs report \u2013 the one that got the Bureau of Labor Statistics sacked by Trump \u2013 showed US employment growth is stalling, even though the unemployment rate remains at an historically low level of 4.2 per cent. Markets heard what they wanted to hear. Credit: AP Complicating assessment of the labour market, however, is that even as the growth in jobs has flat-lined, the supply of labour has also softened \u2013 the pool of job-seekers has been shrunk because of Trump\u2019s harsh immigration policies. \u201cOverall, while the labour market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results in a slowing in both the supply and demand for workers., This unusual situation suggests that downside risks to employment are rising and, if those risks materialise, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment,\u201d Powell said.\n\nSo, both sides of the Fed\u2019s mandate are under pressure but the data that the data-dependent Fed relies on is, at this point, inconclusive. It remains very possible that both the inflation and unemployment rates could rise together. Trump, having spent years attacking Powell, is ramping up his campaign to \u201cMAGA-fy\u201d th Fed. The US economy is growing at about half the rate it did last year. Stagnation \u2013 low growth with relatively high inflation \u2013 remains a realistic possibility. That would confront the Fed with a very difficult choice of which side of its mandate to prioritise.\n\nPowell said it would not allow a one-time increase in prices to become an ongoing inflation problem, but when the risks to its dual mandate are evenly balanced, what does it do? History would suggest it would prioritise the fight against inflation. The Fed\u2019s predicament is worsened by Trump\u2019s continuing assaults on its independence. If it is to retain the credibility that is essential to bond investors\u2019 trust that it will act in accordance with its view of the economy\u2019s best long term interests, rather than short term political pressures, it can\u2019t be seen to be succumbing to Trump\u2019s campaign for radically lower interest rates \u2013 he wants them 3 percentage points lower \u2013 in order to lower the interest costs on America\u2019s exploding government debt levels and boost growth. That could, while it retains its independence, make it more cautious than it might otherwise be, relying on data that reflects the recent economic past to justify a rate cut or hike.\n\nTrump, having spent years attacking Powell, is ramping up his campaign to \u201cMAGA-fy\u201d th Fed. He\u2019s explored the possibility of sacking Powell, but doesn\u2019t have that power. He tried to make a case that a blow-out in the cost of the Fed\u2019s Washington headquarters provided a \u201ccause\u201d to fire Powell, but that effort fizzled. He has nominated Stephen Miran, the chairman of his council of economic advisers and a man who has said the president should be able to hire and fire Fed governors, to fill a vacant seat on the central bank\u2019s board. Now, even as Powell delivered his address at Jackson Hole, Trump called for the resignation of a sitting Fed governor, Lisa Cook, and threatened to fire her after the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, Bill Pulte, alleged she had committed mortgage fraud.\n\nCook, whose term doesn\u2019t expire until 2038, has said she won\u2019t be \u201cbullied\u201d into resigning \u201cbecause of some questions raised in a tweet.\u201d It is unclear, even if the allegation were proven, whether it would be serious enough to provide \u201ccause\u201d for her removal or whether Trump has the authority to fire a board member of a quasi private institution. Nevertheless, the attack on Cook (using mortgage fraud allegations that Pulte has also deployed against other Trump adversaries like Democrat Adam Schiff and New York Attorney-General Letitia James) is, with the nomination of Miran, a clear signal that Trump isn\u2019t going to abandon his efforts to gain influence over the Fed and its decision-making. If Miran is confirmed by Congress, there will be three Trump-appointed people on the Fed\u2019s seven-member board of governors. If he could force Cook out, there\u2019d be a majority of Trump appointees. The board doesn\u2019t make interest rate decisions \u2013 those are made by the 12 members of the Open Market Committee, which includes the seven board members, the president of the New York Fed and four of the other 11 regional Fed presidents \u2013 but a strong Trump representation within those meetings could be intimidating, particularly as it is the Fed\u2019s board that has the power to approve, or disapprove, the appointment of regional Fed presidents.",

        "text": "Melbourne Coach Simon Goodwin is already out, and there could be other high-profile exits to come. Christian Petracca and Clayton Oliver \u2013 who are both on contracts worth more than a million dollars a year \u2013 were both keen for a fresh start last year. The Demons refused to consider trading them in 2024, so it will be interesting to see if Petracca and Oliver try to move again \u2013 and if list boss Tim Lamb softens his stance with a new coach on the way. There is nothing to the Petracca-Hawthorn whispers at this stage. Young defender Judd McVee is looking around, and has interest from the two WA clubs, while Adelaide also raised his name internally, as he weighs up whether to stay in red and blue. The other player whose name came up in trade speculation is forward Bayley Fritsch. They are among the clubs to have shown interest in Marcus Windhager, but his preference is to remain at St Kilda if they improve their financial offer. Giant Wade Derksen is on Melbourne\u2019s radar, potentially as a delisted free agent. Could Christian Petracca follow Simon Goodwin in leaving Melbourne? Credit: AFL Photos North Melbourne The Kangaroos want to add some defensive steel to their mostly young midfield brigade, and have identified Saint Marcus Windhager as the man who could do that. They have presented a five-year contract offer with serious financial terms to Windhager\u2019s management, and have as good a chance as any suitor if he chooses to depart. That said, Windhager\u2019s preference is to continue playing with his close friend Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera at St Kilda. No.4 draft pick Zane Duursma has had an inauspicious first two seasons in the AFL, averaging only seven disposals and kicking 13 goals in 23 matches. North have no intention to move him on, regardless of how frustrated he might be. Will Phillips and Bailey Scott are worth monitoring as two players who spent most of the season out of the senior side.\n\nLoading Port Adelaide Like crosstown rivals Adelaide, the Power missed out on Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera\u2019s signature. They have a decision to make on ex-Hawk Ryan Burton, who has struggled with injuries and is no longer a first-choice defender at Alberton. Burton is highly unlikely to be involved in a trade: his fate will likely be re-signing with Port, or signing elsewhere as a delisted free agent (assuming he lands at a third club). Giant Jacob Wehr is one player they are monitoring. The biggest priority is retaining midfield star Zak Butters, who is a restricted free agent next year. The Power have presented him with a new-age deal, where he can re-sign for two years \u2013 taking him to unrestricted free agency \u2013 then have the option to tack on six more. A conga line of Victorian clubs are interested in bringing Butters back to his home state, but don\u2019t expect a resolution in the next two months. Richmond There won\u2019t be a repeat of last year\u2019s big-name departures (Shai Bolton, Daniel Rioli, Liam Baker and co.), with the Tigers instead set to work on the margins as their rebuild continues. They are among the clubs chasing out-of-favour Suns goalsneak Malcolm Rosas, while they have told veteran winger Kamdyn McIntosh he won\u2019t be offered a contract for 2026. Jacob Koschitzke is unlikely to score a new contract at Richmond, but is among the defensive depth options the Giants are sifting through. Jacob Blight fell just short of his contract trigger, and might attract interest elsewhere. Perhaps, the most fascinating situation to monitor is whether Richmond keep the North Melbourne pick they secured during last year\u2019s draft. Free agency compensation, academy and father-son selections, as well as a potential, albeit unlikely, West Coast priority pick, could push it deep into the top 10 in a weaker draft than recent years.\n\nSt Kilda The Saints are preparing for a club-defining off-season after making Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera the league\u2019s first $2 million man. They upped their seven-year offer for Carlton ruckman Tom De Koning to about $1.8 million-a-year, as this masthead reported on Wednesday, while they are in the box seat for GWS defender Leek Aleer, who is seeking greater opportunity. St Kilda have also positioned themselves as favourites for contracted West Coast forward Liam Ryan if he departs. The Saints will take advantage of salary cap rules to pay above the limit to accommodate the incoming talent, but there may be some losses. North Melbourne have offered Marcus Windhager a five-year deal, while Melbourne and Essendon have also expressed interest. Contracted ruckman Rowan Marshall has a call to make with De Koning\u2019s impending arrival, and Geelong are a possible destination. Captain Jack Steele will probably remain at Moorabbin, barring a late twist. Marcus Windhager\u2019s future at St Kilda remains uncertain after the Saints retained Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera (left) as they prepare to bring in Leek Aleer and Tom De Koning (both right) Credit: Matt Davidson Sydney The Swans plan to be aggressive in the player movement period after a rare September off, with dual Coleman medallist Charlie Curnow linked to them. However, coach Dean Cox said this week they had not spoken to the star Blue. Curnow, who raised the possibility mid-season of a move to Gold Coast, is contracted at Carlton until the end of 2029, so a lot would have to happen for him to follow Tony Lockett, Barry Hall and Lance Franklin as a marquee forward recruit for Sydney. The Swans inquired about troubled Western Bulldog Jamarra Ugle-Hagan, but have reportedly cooled on the idea of bringing him in. The Ugle-Hagan situation remains delicate. They still have work to do to retain Jake Lloyd and back-up ruckman Peter Ladhams, and have decisions to make on veterans Dane Rampe, Robbie Fox and Joel Hamling. Cox also made clear that Ollie Florent \u2013 who spent significant time in the VFL this year \u2013 was under contract and a required player. Sydney have liked Sun Malcolm Rosas for years, and this could be the time they finally secure him.\n\nLoading West Coast The Eagles are primed for a big off-season after a second wooden spoon finish in three seasons, and four straight years in the bottom three. They will lose restricted free agent Oscar Allen to Brisbane, but would gain the No.2 draft pick as compensation, while Liam Ryan (contracted until 2026) is weighing up a move to Victoria, with St Kilda the likeliest destination. Speculation continues about Harley Reid, but any decision on his future is not expected to occur this year. Uncontracted speedster Jack Petruccelle is another to watch. West Coast would love to bring Brisbane premiership defender Brandon Starcevich home, and are in a tug-of-war with Adelaide for another Lion, Callum Ah Chee. They also expressed interest in Docker Neil Erasmus, veteran Cat Mitch Duncan and Giant Wade Derksen. The Eagles have long held interest in Deven Robertson, who could aid their midfield depth. Western Bulldogs Coach Luke Beveridge previously hinted at his disenchantment with his key defensive stocks, but was blatant about it after the Dogs\u2019 round 24 defeat to Fremantle. He even mentioned they will see what is available in the \u201cmarket\u201d, so watch this space, given they already met with Jack Silvagni. That followed Beveridge subbing out Jedd Busslinger in the third quarter to go smaller despite acknowledging they were struggling with the Dockers\u2019 talls. Veteran Liam Jones played just once after round six, while mid-sized backman Buku Khamis is exploring his options after not playing in the Bulldogs\u2019 past eight matches. There is also fascination about midfielder Adam Treloar, whose physical issues mean the Dogs are yet to a new contract for him. Along with Silvagni, they have registered their interest in young Docker Neil Erasmus, while Gold Coast\u2019s Alex Davies is someone they inquired about in the past.",

        "text": "This practice rocketed during the pandemic, and in 2022 60 per cent of employees said they thought they were being monitored at work, according to a survey by the TUC union. The proportion of employers tracking workers is expected to rise to 70 per cent by 2025, the management consultancy Gartner found. Bosses have used surveillance software to check on staff with keystroke logging, screen monitoring, time tracking and chat monitoring. These programs, some of which take screenshots of workers\u2019 computers, can crack the tactics used by employees, such as running hours-long Powerpoint presentations. Some software offers the ability to log into an employee\u2019s device remotely. Credit: Michele Mossop Some businesses use software that can take photos of employees via their laptop every few minutes and use their webcam to monitor them. Others offer \u201cproductivity scores\u201d on workers, depending on their activity levels. Those mouse jigglers can also be outwitted by software because the cursor activity doesn\u2019t look normal. Algorithms can also see when a mouse is active over the same web page for hours at a time. Teramind, a software firm that can identify repetitive cursor movements, found that out of one million employees sampled, 7 per cent appeared to be faking activity at work. This year, one American bank fired more than a dozen of its workers for pretending to work.\n\nSome software also offers the ability to log into an employee\u2019s device remotely or track an employee\u2019s tone and mood, and judge how useful their conversations are. One such program, Aware, can sync with popular workplace chat tools, such as Slack, to check the conversations of specific employees. It also claims to use artificial intelligence to track employee sentiment and monitor for certain behaviours. Loading Starbucks, AstraZeneca and Nestle all use software to monitor chats, which can also identify bullying, harassment and apparent discrimination. Elsewhere, one major consultancy company checks the IP address of remote workers to check they are not \u201cworking from the beach\u201d. Employers that want staff back in the office are also using programs to monitor attendance. PwC, which has asked employees to go back three days a week, said it will track where its staff work to enforce the rules. Outfoxing bosses\n\nSome staff are already taking matters into their own hands \u2013 and their tactics are getting more hi-tech. A finance sector worker told The Telegraph that they, having some systems literacy, were able to bypass surveillance software by finding out which processes it tracked and looking for holes. \u201cIf the software only surveils processes called \u201cchrome.exe\u201d, \u201copera.exe\u201d, \u201cfirefox.exe\u201d you make a copy, rename it \u201cexcel.exe\u201d or something and you\u2019re good to go,\u201d they said. Others have been able to bypass the top-end software, which might surveil keywords and take screenshots, by creating a virtual machine on the work computer which is untrackable. Labour\u2019s promise to strengthen employment rights could affect this kind of surveillance software, by ensuring that bosses negotiate with staff and unions over its usage. Already, a patchwork of legislation, from GDPR to Employment Rights Act provisions, place limits on what bosses can do when it comes to digital surveillance. Does this software actually work? Amit Raj, founder of the Links Guys, who runs a fully remote company and uses tracking software, says even the most intricate tracking software wouldn\u2019t be able to account for some remote staff\u2019s get-out-of-work ploys.\n\n\u201cThere will always be some people who don\u2019t work. While I\u2019m not worried about employees watching YouTube for a few minutes, you can\u2019t really track someone if they\u2019re watching something on a second device and not working.\u201d This hasn\u2019t stopped Raj from looking into how to ensure staff stay on track. The software he uses to surveil staff, apart from senior hires, includes activity tracking, screenshots, time tracking, and the ability to check breaks. He describes how this software\u2019s screenshot application has caught someone who just kept a work program open all day without doing much. But this requires an investigation with HR to confirm if that worker was actually doing anything, and he questions how useful some of the tracking software is. \u201cIt can\u2019t tell you if they\u2019re actually on a computer,\u201d he says. Raj also uses surveillance software at the interview stage, to catch out jobseekers using so-called \u201cvirtual candidates\u201d or ChatGPT to complete tasks. Of course, there are limits. Experts in HR worry surveillance might end up with unproductive consequences, impacting innovation, and sparking burnout and affecting wellbeing too. Others have questioned if they can truly track how work, well, works. Do they take into account paper notes, meetings, having to use the toilet?",

Records show the home last traded in 1977 for $81,000. The property was one of 943 scheduled to go to auction in Melbourne over the week. By Saturday evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 75.1 per cent from 719 reported results, while 53 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate. Elsewhere, a first-home buyer beat out five others for the keys to a Keilor Downs townhouse, securing it at auction for $691,000 on Saturday.\n\nWith a price range of $570,000-$600,000, 8A Karu Court sold for $91,000 over its reserve of $600,000. \u201cThe bidding was so fast I didn\u2019t even get time to announce it was on the market until it hit about $650,000, where there was a pause,\u201d said selling agent Andrew Koulaouzos from Barry Plant Taylors Lakes. Six registered bidders took part in the auction, all were young first-home buyers. The auction opened at $570,000, quickly rising to $650,000, then slowed down, with two active bidders remaining.\n\nThe new owners celebrated with their whole family, who were in attendance, said Koulaouzos. Loading \u201cThey were rapt, it was like they had just got married,\u201d he said. The three-bedroom home had over 57 parties inspect it over the campaign; the interest had a lot to do with the staging. \u201cThey put a fresh coat of paint on the inside walls, spruced up the garden, and staged the interior with new furniture and curtains,\u201d Koulaouzos said.\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t value staging, but it can definitely give the property more appeal.\u201d In Parkdale, a renovated weatherboard home sold under the hammer for $1,735,000. The four-bedroom home at 44 Keith Street had a price guide of $1.55 million to $1.65 million and a reserve at the top of the range. Two active bidders took part in the rapid-fire auction, said selling agent Aidan Oke from Ray White, The Bayside Group.\n\n\u201cWe had a couple trying to upsize out of Bentleigh, who were the underbidder, and a local young family that purchased it,\u201d Oke said. Loading The location of the four-bedroom, single-level home in a coveted Bayside enclave was a major drawcard. In an interesting sign of the market, Oke said that another agent sold a house on the next street for $1.65 million recently, which is \u201creally comparable.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a Parkdale local, so I really take notice of the market, and that\u2019s a sign of a five per cent shift in the family home market in the space of a couple of weeks,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think more people have more access to cash with the recent rate cuts, and given it\u2019s not even spring yet, it\u2019s a promising sign for the local market.\u201d LJ Hooker\u2019s head of research, Mathew Tiller, said Melbourne\u2019s auction clearance rate reflects a strength in buyer numbers, both attending open homes and bidding at auctions. \u201cThere has definitely been an uptick from buyers, we saw it after the first rate cut and definitely now again after the second, not just in auctions but in sales more generally,\u201d he said. Tiller also noted that there is still a \u201creally low\u201d level of listings in the Melbourne market.\n\n\u201cThis is driving buyer demand, especially for quality listings with a good location and good price point,\u201d he said. Loading In Camberwell, a five-bedroom Californian bungalow with its own putting green passed in at auction but sold later that day for $3.85 million after private negotiations. The home at 12 Radnor Street had a price guide of $3.6 million to $3.96 million. While Belle Property Director Steve Burke declined to disclose the reserve, he said that it \u201cwas sold well in the range.\u201d The auction drew a crowd of 60, with three active bidders participating.",

        "text": "I think that the way our children [conducted] themselves through the crisis of our illness and the subsequent legal proceedings is testament to her mothering skills. Our children were thrown into an unprecedented situation in which they suddenly had to take medical responsibility for the lives of their parents: the trauma that they experienced at their mother\u2019s death and at my near-death has left deep wounds. I\u2019m deeply grieved by their ongoing pain. Heather was a proud grandma who loved each of our six grandchildren. Heather took an active interest in their lives and created activities that would bring them together. Family events are no longer the same. A very important member of our family is missing. Heather was also a fellow traveller with me in the way of Jesus, along with many other people. She took her faith very seriously. It shaped her life and the way that she lived. Heather was full of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, faithfulness and self-control. All the fruits of the spirit of Jesus living in her, we encouraged each other and urged each other on to love God and love our neighbours as ourselves. Convicted triple-murderer Erin Patterson arriving at the Supreme Court of Victoria in Melbourne on Monday. Credit: Jason Edwards She had a particular compassion for strugglers and disadvantaged people, and that was reflected in the teaching, mentoring work she chose to do when she re-entered the workforce after our children had reached secondary age.\n\nI could go on; there\u2019s so much more that deserves to be said about Heather. It\u2019s one of the distressing shortcomings of our society that so much attention is showered on those who do evil and so little on those who do good. The greatest impact of Erin\u2019s actions on me has been to deprive me of Heather\u2019s company and Heather\u2019s important place in our family \u2013 the silence in our home is a daily reminder. I continue to carry a heavy burden of grief over her untimely death. It\u2019s a truly horrible thought to live with, that somebody could decide to take her life. I only feel half alive without her. My consolation is that we will be reunited in the resurrection and the age to come. In a similar vein, the second-heaviest impact on me has been the loss of Don and Gail. They were the next two closest people to me, after Heather and our family, and again, they were good and solid people. No doubt their families will say more about them, but I would like to acknowledge their good character and their constructive influence on my life. Our families grew up together. They were all so serious about following Jesus, and we encouraged and supported each other for about 50 years. My life is greatly impoverished without them. I have suffered severe personal impacts from Erin\u2019s actions.\n\nI very, very nearly died. It has taken me the best part of two years for my health and strength to recover to the point that I have. I praise God for my miraculous healing, and I thank the many medical professionals who strived to save all four of us. They threw everything into our care. I joke that I know this because I have a bump on the back of my head from the kitchen sink. It\u2019s a grief to them that Heather, Gail and Don died. Although I\u2019ve made a good recovery, my health has never returned to the levels I had before the fateful lunch. I have reduced kidney function, ongoing respiratory issues and reduced energy, and I\u2019ve had to face the many challenges of re-establishing life without Heather. The challenge has vastly changed \u2026 I\u2019m suddenly single. The heartbreak of having to wind up her affairs. Returning to pastoral work without her help and sage advice. Unsettled sleep. Nobody to share in life\u2019s daily tasks, which has taken much of the joy out of pottering around the house and the garden. Nobody to debrief with at the end of the day. The impacts are so many and varied, some big and a myriad of small things, that no list could ever contain them. Loading I\u2019m distressed that Erin has acted with callous and calculated disregard for my life and the lives of those I love. What foolishness possesses a person to think that murder could be the solution to their problems, especially the murder of people who had only good intentions towards her? Erin has brought deep sorrow and grief into my life and the lives of many others, the ripples spread out through family, friends, our church, congregation, the local community and beyond.",

        "text": "He was a seven-time NBL most valuable player (the trophy is named in his honour), and 14-time scoring champion, winning championships in 1993 and 1997. He was a first-team All-NBL player for a record 15 straight seasons, and averaged a phenomenal 30.8 points per game through a stunning career. Gaze led the Boomers to five Olympics, and was the flag bearer and overall team captain at the 2000 Sydney Games. The award for the best Australian international player of the year is the Gaze Medal. In 2013, he joined his father Lindsay, the godfather of Australian basketball, in the FIBA Hall of Fame. All this from a boy who literally grew up at the old Albert Park Basketball Stadium, where Lindsay was the general manager and the family lived in the attached residence. Gaze fell just short of an Olympic medal. The Boomers finished fourth three times (1988, \u201996 and 2000) during his time. The bronze medal loss to Lithuania at the Atlanta Games in \u201996, when star centre Arvydas Sabonis nailed two big three pointers, still hurts. Had the Australians had Luc Longley available through the tournament \u2013 the towering centre had been asked by the Chicago Bulls to have ankle surgery \u2013 a maiden men\u2019s basketball medal may have been within reach.\n\n\u201cThose moments are of what-ifs, or if only had he [Sabonis] missed a couple of those, it might have been a different outcome,\u201d Gaze said. Those were the days: Melbourne Tigers\u2019 greats Mark Bradtke, Andrew Gaze and Lanard Copeland. Credit: Fairfax Photographic The teary emotions Gaze had on national television when that drought was finally broken at the 2021 Olympics in Tokyo highlighted how much the Boomers still mean to him, a legacy of growing up around the team when his father was coach. \u201cThe thing that sticks out the most for me, I cast back to when I was a youngster, and the Australian team, the values around the team, and playing for Australia, and competing at the Olympic Games, and the spirit of the games, they were instilled in me because of my dad and, because of that, all my dreams as a youngster were Australian team and Olympic centric,\u201d Gaze said. \u201cUnlike today, where you can just jump on your phone, or watch it on television, access to college basketball, NBA, European basketball was basically non-existent.\u201d\n\nGaze remains arguably the greatest shooter this country has produced, his classical technique making him and Brazilian great Oscar Schmidt as feared as any US star when it came to the Olympics, where Schmidt and Gaze still sit one and two for most career points, and the world championships. Loading In the late 1980s, The Age ran weekly sketches of instructional training and technique advice from Gaze, who remembers these fondly. It was an idea ahead of its time, this type of information now the domain of social media and the innumerable so-called basketball experts the sport breeds. Gaze\u2019s one season with US college Seton Hall University in 1988-89, when the Pirates had a Cinderella run to the NCAA final, losing in overtime to the Michigan Wolverines, with Gaze starting in all games, sparked live coverage of the games in Australia, and extensive media exposure. He narrowly missed an NBA contract with the Seattle Supersonics. He was a pioneer in playing professionally in Europe, and his time in the NBA initially came with a stint with the then Washington Bullets in 1994. There was another with the 1998-99 San Antonio Spurs, but he did not suit up as a member of the actual playing squad through the play-offs en route to their title. Still, he received a championship ring. His perimeter shooting, and ability to space the floor, would have been ideal in the modern game.\n\n\u201cI had my opportunities, I got a taste of it, but there were some ... decisions that I made during that period of time, if I had thrown myself out there a bit more, perhaps been a bit more aggressive at exploring opportunities, things might have been different, but not different enough that I have any regrets,\u201d Gaze said. Gaze coached in the NBL with the Sydney Kings from 2016-19, and revealed a desire to still coach at the top level in Australia, or abroad, potentially in Asia, where opportunities beckon. Cricketing great urges caution over privatisation bid Australian cricket great Belinda Clark has urged the sport\u2019s authorities to retain a country-over-club mantra when it comes to debating privatisation of women\u2019s Twenty20 cricket.\n\nA report by the Boston Consulting Group has listed alternative forms of investment and ownership, including privatisation, of the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Big Bash Leagues for Cricket Australia to consider in a bid to help strengthen the standing of the two competitions, and attract the extra funds needed to lure the world\u2019s best players, particularly in the men\u2019s league. CA, state associations and other key figures are debating the report, but Clark \u2013 a former senior CA executive and interim chief executive officer who on Monday was elevated to legend status in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame \u2013 said caution was required when it came to ensuring the women\u2019s program, including its pathways, continued to grow. Great honour: Cricketing great Belinda Clark has been elevated to legend status in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. Credit: Paul Harris \u201cI think it [privatisation] is definitely worth exploring appropriately. Whether it\u2019s privatised or not, I think the key issue for the sport is how it balances the international game and the domestic game. If you throw all that league cricket into the domestic bucket, it\u2019s really challenging,\u201d Clark said. \u201cI think the women\u2019s game has done a pretty good job so far of balancing those two things. I think the men\u2019s game has a challenge on its hands, but I think it\u2019s important that the lens we look through for both the men\u2019s and women\u2019s game is specific for them, and I think the women have the chance to get the balance right.\n\nLoading \u201cThe men are in a position where they are trying to balance it. It\u2019s something that has got to be a bit of give and take, whereas the women aren\u2019t at that point. It\u2019s really important that we keep international cricket as the premier competition. \u201cWhat that does is it allows you to grow the game globally, these domestic leagues won\u2019t allow you to do that in the same way. You don\u2019t get the opportunities unless you are at the top of the tree to be playing in the domestic comps. I feel a really strong sense that this game should have opportunities for everyone, that we do need international cricket at all of its levels to continue to expand and provide people with the chance to play.\u201d Clark, 54, has played an instrumental role in the rise of women\u2019s cricket, as a player, captain and administrator, who now runs her own leadership company. Already with a swag of honours, Clark has been bestowed another by the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 2011 as an athlete member.\n\nLoading \u201cI feel a mix of gratitude, humbleness, just amazed that it has all led to this,\u201d Clark said. A superb leader and one of the finest batters of her generation, Clark was captain of the Australian women\u2019s team for 11 years from 1993, and won World Cups in 1997 and 2005. She still retains the record for most runs (4844 at an average of 47.49) by an Australian woman in ODIs, ahead of Karen Rolton and Meg Lanning, and has captained the most matches (101) with an 83 per cent winning record. She was the first woman to score a double century in a one-day international. \u201cI am really proud the sport has moved along to where there is so much cricket going on now, both ODIs and T20s in particular. Which is why it lends itself to becoming a professional sport, because you are playing a lot,\u201d Clark said.\n\nClark was the first woman inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame and the second in the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. In 2023, a statue of Clark was unveiled outside the members\u2019 entrance to the Sydney Cricket Ground. \u201cI often get people sending me pictures of them with it, and I just love it. That\u2019s fun and I enjoy that,\u201d Clark said. Her legend status in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame caps a remarkable journey for a woman who grew up in Newcastle where her father, Allan, was an excellent local cricketer, while mother Margaret was a state tennis champion. Clark dreamt of winning Wimbledon, and idolised John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova. \u201cI still take an interest. I think tennis is a great sport, particularly as a kid, it teaches you tactics, it teaches you movement, it teaches you to be self-reliant, there is no one out there with you \u2026 you are umpiring yourselves, so there is an element of being able to call a game yourself,\u201d Clark said.\n\n\u201cI really loved the game, but it just got to a point where cricket became a passion, it became the sport I loved the most.\u201d Clark turned to cricket at 13 when at Newcastle High School, and later played district cricket in Sydney for Gordon. She debuted for Australia in an ODI in 1991, and a fortnight later posted a century on Test debut against India at North Sydney Oval. Clark was made Australian captain in 1993 after a disappointing World Cup sparked change. She was a key figure in the World Cup win in India in \u201997, top-scoring with 52 in a low-scoring final against New Zealand. Her 970 runs that year remains a calendar year ODI record in the women\u2019s game. There was more World Cup glory in 2005, when the Australians edged India in the final. Clark retired later that year, her 15 Tests reaping 919 runs at 45.95. So great has contribution been to the sport that the Australian women\u2019s international player of the year is awarded the Belinda Clark Medal, as is the NSW Breakers\u2019 player of the year in the women\u2019s national cricket league.",

Picture: Martin Ollman / NewsWire\n\nAustralia might be able to stave off higher US tariffs if Anthony Albanese \u201cstays away\u201d from Donald Trump, independent senator Jacqui Lambie says.\n\nThe US President spared Australia from tariff hikes earlier month, leaving the rate at 10 per cent for most goods.\n\nIt is the lowest rate any country has managed to secure and has been achieved without an in-person meeting between the Prime Minister and Mr Trump.\n\nSenator Lambie said on Monday that Mr Albanese\u2019s inability to lock in a face-to-face has \u201cprobably worked well\u201d.\n\nSenator Jacqui Lambie says there no need to \u2018push the envelope\u2019 to get an Albanese-Trump meeting. Picture: Martin Ollman / NewsWire\n\n\u201cTariffs didn\u2019t go up so that was a bit of a bonus,\u201d she told Nine.\n\n\u201cSo maybe if maybe if Albo stays away from him that may continue.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThough, she added \u201cit\u2019s really rude actually of Trump\u201d not to meet with Mr Albanese, saying she knew the government \u201cis doing everything it can to secure a meeting\u201d.\n\nSenator Lambie said it was \u201cactually Trump\u201d who was the barrier.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not on Albanese at all,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly \u2026 if he doesn\u2019t want to meet you, then why push the envelope?\u201d\n\nWhile most Australian exports are covered by the 10 per cent duties, some are hit with higher rates.\n\nSteel, aluminium and copper are subject to 50 per cent levies.\n\nMost vehicles and automotive parts are slugged with 25 per cent imposts.\n\nThe Trump administration is also eyeing broader sectoral tariffs, including on timber, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.\n\nWith pharmaceuticals worth billions to Australian producers, Mr Trump\u2019s floated 250 per cent duties on the industry have triggered alarm bells in Canberra.\n\nUS President Donald Trump is not is eyeing more sectoral tariffs. Picture: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / AFP\n\n\u2018I never see those submarines coming\u2019\n\nNoting looming concerns around AUKUS sparked by the Trump administration\u2019s review, Senator Lambie said it was \u201cembarrassing\u201d that Australia had funnelled billions to Washington without much to show for the submarine pact.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve paid $2bn but haven\u2019t seen one piece of metal,\u201d she said.\n\nThe crossbencher also said she did not think \u201cit makes any difference \u2026 if you were mates with (Mr Trump) or you weren\u2019t\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen he decides to make his mind up, he makes mind up and everybody else pays the consequences,\u201d Senator Lambie said.\n\nMr Albanese, for better or worse, will likely meet Mr Trump before year\u2019s end.\n\nThe two leaders have several summits coming up, offering them opportunities to have a one-on-one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have meetings with President Trump at a number of events over the coming months,\u201d Mr Albanese told reporters earlier on Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re about to enter summit season, and I look forward to discussions continuing face-to-face as they have been constructive when I\u2019ve had discussions with President Trump up to now.\u201d\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese will likely meet US President Donald Trump before year\u2019s end. Picture: Martin Ollman / NewsWire\n\nHe also said it was a \u201cgood thing\u201d that ministers were meeting with their US counterparts, in reference to Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister Richard Marles\u2019 visit to Washington this week.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpeaking later on Sky, Senator Lambie, a veteran, dismissed Mr Marles\u2019 visit as \u201cjust another free trip on the taxpayer\u201d.\n\n\u201cIs there another cheque that we\u2019re going to give the US for submarines where we haven\u2019t seen one piece of steel?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI never see those submarines coming.\u201d\n\nShe went on to take aim at Mr Marles directly, saying he was not focused on arming Australia with the missiles and drones it needs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any admiration for Richard Marles,\u201d Senator Lambie said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made that quite clear during the last few years, especially when it comes to Defence and Defence personnel.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing anything about the clean-up in Defence.\n\n\u201cSo if you want to waste taxpayers money and send him over there, be my guest.\u201d",
