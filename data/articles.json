(ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\nCouncil chief executive Nat Traeger said there was a lot of interest in the future of the obelisk.\n\n\"As with anything that's iconic that is at risk, even though it's a negative story, people do seem to gravitate towards that,\" she said.\n\n\"Even though it could be 10, 20 or 30 years, it would be terrible to miss the actual moment the obelisk falls in.\"\n\nMs Traeger said if the council gave the project the go-ahead, a camera could be installed in the first quarter of next year.\n\nRobe Obelisk Working Party chair Richie White (left) with Nat Traeger at the obelisk.

We don't want that to influence what people's opinion is.\"\n\nEngaging the next generation\n\nAt the local primary school, the issues facing the obelisk have captured the attention of year 5/6 students Mani, Ariah, Edie, Mali, Fred and Morgan.\n\nRobe Primary School students Mani, Ariah, Edie, Mali and Fred. (ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\n\"The erosion's getting really bad and that's what's mainly causing this,\" Edie said.\n\n\" I just think it's really amazing that so many people have loved this one building for so long. \"\n\nMali said it was also an important symbol for the school.\n\n\"[It's] representing Robe itself, and showing that school kids here are really proud of where they live,\" she said.\n\nImages of the obelisk are prominent around the school and Robe more widely. (ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\nWith the new camera project, Fred and Mani said it would be exciting to see the moment the obelisk tumbled into the ocean.\n\n\"I think it will be really good to see such a special moment of something that shaped our town falling,\" Fred said.\n\nAriah said the moment would be tinged with some sadness, though.\n\n\"Not only has it been a part of our town for so long, but I think that Robe would also drop a bit in popularity,\" she said.\n\nMorgan said he also believed it would hurt visitation.\n\n\"We might lose a fair few tourists who come to Robe for a holiday,\" he said.\n\nAccess to Robe's iconic obelisk has been restricted due to erosion at Cape Dombey. (ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\nCommunity backing\n\nSchool principal Anne Grayson said nearly 20 parents responded to an initial letter asking for help once the camera was set up.\n\nShe said the school would also look at how it could use the project in its teaching in some way.\n\n\"Erosion and degradation are part of everyday life in Robe,\" she said.\n\n\"It is part of our science curriculum covering topics like erosion, and the fact kids can walk outside their front door and see it happening in real time is highly engaging, even though it's devastating.\"\n\nRobe Lions Club president Trevor Wagner said he was keen to support the project.\n\nTrevor Wagner is keen for people around the world to tune into the project. (ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\n\"The obelisk is such an icon in Robe, and unfortunately, we all realise that one day it's going to go,\" he said.\n\n\"The chances of us seeing it go are very slim, until this idea came up.\n\n\"I think it's something that people all over the world will hopefully be able to log in and have a look.\"",

Trump\u2019s 50 per cent tariff on India\u2019s exports to the US might also become a discussion point between the US and India if the US is serious about throttling Russia\u2019s oil revenues. Russia will almost inevitably find some sort of workaround \u2013 it\u2019s shown how resourceful and creative its oil exporters can be \u2013 but there will be some squeezing of its oil exports and, if it is to largely maintain export volumes, it will probably come at the cost of even bigger discounts to global prices.\n\nThe EU and United Kingdon (but not the US), last month reduced the price cap on Russian oil (backed by the threat of sanctions and loss of insurance cover) from the $US60 a barrel cap imposed in late 2022 to $US47.60 a barrel. Russia\u2019s flagship crude had been selling at $US12 to $US13 a barrel discounts to the previous cap. To maintain export volumes now that Rosneft and Lukoil have been sanctioned, Russia may well have to increase the scale of its discounts even as the cost of establishing new and more expensive ways of circumventing the sanctions increases. With oil exports accounting for about one-third of Russia\u2019s budget revenues and those revenues already under pressure from a slowing economy and an inflation rate running above 8 per cent, the impact of the sanctions on Russia\u2019s economy \u2013 if the US polices them effectively \u2013 could be material. That economy has held up far better than expected when the West first responded to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine with sanctions and the seizure of about $US300 billion ($457.4 billion) of Russia\u2019s offshore foreign exchange reserves, largely because Vladimir Putin rapidly switched its structure away from a market-driven economy to a wartime economy.\n\nPerversely, that generated increased growth, reduced unemployment and significant increases in wages as more and more of Russia\u2019s industrial base \u2013 and its citizens \u2013 were devoted to the war effort. There are, however, now signs of strain. Russia\u2019s industrial base is now devoted to producing goods that, once deployed in the war, produce no recurrent economic benefit. Investment has flowed away from other activities into military spending, increasingly starving non-military activity of funds. With oil inventories bulging and expanding and OPEC still sitting on millions of barrels a day of unused capacity, any reduction in the flow of Russian oil into the global market could be absorbed without massive price impacts. The expansion of the Russian military, and the need to replace the hundreds of thousands who have died and the other hundreds of thousands that have been wounded, is producing shortages of workers across the economy while driving up wages and inflation. Resources have been concentrated in Moscow and military centres, drawing them away from the regions and causing financial stresses and degrading services in some of Russia\u2019s poorer regions.\n\nFrom a remarkably positive 4.3 per cent growth in GDP last year, even Russia\u2019s own forecasters see growth of only about 1 per cent this year. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank both forecast growth of less than 1 per cent this year and not much more over the next few years. Loading Last week Russia\u2019s central bank cut its policy rate by 0.5 of a percentage point, to 16.5 per cent. It had been as high as 21 per cent. Economic growth of 1per cent or less and inflation of 8 per cent or more equals stagflation. Russia\u2019s economy is stagnating, with the inflation rate eroding the value of the revenues and taxes available for military spending, which accounts for about 40 per cent of Moscow\u2019s spending and about 8 per cent of GDP \u2013 about twice the amount spent before the invasion. Moscow is budgeting for flat defence and security expenditures in 2025-26. That implies a reduction in real terms and signals how tight the country\u2019s finances now are even though the government has been increasing fees, fines, taxes on individuals and companies and has foreshadowed an increase in the country\u2019s value-added tax rate to 22 per cent and a broadening of that tax\u2019s base.",

        "text": "She was sufficiently connected, however, to be in Epstein\u2019s seven-storey townhouse in Manhattan in December 2010. Unbeknownst to Epstein and Andrew, a photographer was watching them. Keating was seen leaving the house as Andrew waved her farewell at the front door. Loading Her misfortune was to be in the house at what turned out to be a pivotal moment. Epstein and Andrew went for a walk in Central Park \u2013 and the photographer, Jae Donnelly, took the shot that proved they were back in touch. Andrew chose to keep up his friendship with a man convicted of sex with a minor. Keating has never talked about why she was at Epstein\u2019s house that December. But she confirmed she went to the dinner in February. \u201cIt was a large social event,\u201d she told The Daily Mail, and she mentioned prominent media personalities who also attended. \u201cA sizeable chunk of NY society was there, including Barbara Walters, Charlie Rose and Katie Couric. At the time, I had only lived in NY about 10 weeks, and was happy to accept the odd social invitation.\u201d\n\nShe could not be contacted by this masthead for comment. All of this is fuel for those who assume the guilt of anyone who came near Epstein. Social media has spread slurs about Keating for years because of the townhouse photo. Some will add the email to the mix. But the public interest is slim. Keating does not hold any public office. She is under no obligation to answer questions about her private life. The main reason for looking into the new email is to counter the conspiracies. One assumption, for instance, is that Keating knew Maxwell and moved in the same circles as Epstein. In fact, there is no evidence that she knew Maxwell before 2014, when she interviewed her for a project called IdeaPod, published by the Huffington Post. Another assumption is that she was very close to Andrew. Instead, the friendship seems to have been with his daughters, Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice. Keating was photographed with Eugenie at Fashion Week in New York in 2014.\n\nAt the risk of labouring the point, there are no grounds for suggesting an intimate relationship with Andrew. Prince Andrew is under renewed pressure over his links with Epstein. Credit: AP Nor is there a reason to think Keating knew all the murky details about Epstein. The plea deal meant some of the facts did not see the light of day until years later. Keating was not alone in walking too close to the spider\u2019s web. Epstein drew many people around him from 2010 onwards, when he regained his place in New York society. Some of them were his accomplices. Others were simply invited to dinner. He used donations to charities, amplified by publicists, to try to bury the past. One New York publicist, Peggy Siegal, ensured he was invited to events. Siegal told The New York Times in 2019 that she had no trouble restarting their friendship after his prison term: \u201cThe culture before #MeToo was \u2013 \u2018You\u2019ve done your time, now you\u2019re forgiven\u2019.\u201d\n\nSiegal arranged a dinner party for Prince Andrew at Epstein\u2019s mansion in 2010, according to The New York Times. Those at the dinner included filmmaker Woody Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn, as well as broadcasters Charlie Rose, Katie Couric and George Stephanopoulos. Loading Turning up to dinner did not make someone an Epstein accomplice. It might demonstrate poor judgment, or ignorance, but not necessarily guilt. Comedian Chelsea Handler attended the 2010 dinner, for instance, and later said she had no idea who Epstein was. She also asked a pointed question of Allen and his wife: \u201cSo, how did you two meet?\u201d Two key conclusions emerge from the email about Keating, Epstein and the prince. The first is that there is no evidence that Keating did anything wrong. The second is that Andrew is utterly exposed. This is the second email to emerge within the last two weeks that confirms he misled the public when he claimed that he cut off contact with Epstein on the day they walked in Central Park in December 2010.",

        "text": "TikTok, Meta and Snapchat have faced a parliamentary inquiry into the teen social media ban, confirming they will deactivate, delete or freeze accounts of those under 16 when the new law comes into effect in December.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe social media company executives \u2014 who appeared remotely via video call \u2014 were questioned about potential harm inflicted on young people by the platforms, age assurance technology measures, and whether they would comply with the impending ban.\n\n\n\n\n\nTiKTok was also asked by a Nationals senator if it was a \"bullying behemoth\" as he accused the social media giant of bullying his office.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens senator Sarah Hanson-Young previously threatened to force executives to appear at the inquiry into online safety after they were no-shows at an earlier hearing, but all three companies agreed to give their views on the social media ban at the hearing without a subpoena.\n\n\n\nCompanies to comply with 'unevenly applied' ban\n\nTikTok, Meta, and Snapchat have confirmed they will comply with the social media ban, though they have expressed concerns about the new law.\n\n\n\nJennifer Stout, Snap's senior vice president of global policy and platform operations, said Snapchat should be excluded as it could be classified as a messaging service, which is supposed to be excluded under the ban. However, it said it would apply with the \"unevenly applied\" ban.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will comply with the law, even though we believe it has been unevenly applied and risks undermining community confidence in the law,\" Stout said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Beginning 10 December, we will disable accounts for Australian Snapchatters under 16. We know this will be difficult for young people who use Snapchat to communicate with their closest friends and family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile TikTok said it would also comply, its director of public policy in Australia, Ella Woods-Joyce, said the ban could cause more harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Experts believe the ban will push younger people into darker corners of the internet where rules, safety tools and protections don't exist,\" Woods-Joyce said.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO 'As data-minimising as possible': under-16 social media ban guidelines published SBS News 03:52 English\n\nMeta will also deactivate any accounts for users under 16 on 10 December, its director of policy in Australia, Mia Garlick, said, ending speculation that the media giant's new teen accounts feature would pave the way for an exemption.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts teen accounts feature is automatically applied to users under 18 and includes additional built-in safety and privacy settings, such as content restrictions, contact limitations, and screen time management tools.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ban will result in about 1.5 million accounts across Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Threads and X being deactivated.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile children under 16 will be banned from social media platforms, there are some exceptions for health and education services, including WhatsApp and Meta's Messenger Kids.\n\n\n\nNew details about the ban's implementation\n\nThe Senate inquiry also revealed more details about how each company would implement the ban.\n\n\n\n\n\nSnapchat and TikTok will archive content \u2014 including posts, photos, and videos \u2014 as part of the process of freezing accounts.\n\n\n\nSnapchat will implement a tool, Download My Data, to help affected users secure photos and communications before accounts are locked. It also questioned temporarily \"freezing\" \u2014 rather than deactivating \u2014 accounts of those close to the age of 16.\n\n\n\n\n\nAffected TikTok users will be able to deactivate, suspend or delete their accounts, with an archive feature available. It said it would use additional measures, including monitoring users' \"behaviours\" to further verify their age.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta users will have the option to delete, deactivate or temporarily pause their accounts, but said they were \"still working through the precise wording and flows\".\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta will use a third-party provider, Yoti, to enforce age assurance technology, giving people the option to submit a video selfie, an age estimation approach, or provide government identification, Garlick said.\n\n\n\nConcerns about age verification technology\n\nThe social media ban is the first of its kind in the world, with TikTok's Woods-Joyce saying the company was \"doing the best we can\" to navigate the new requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, the platforms expressed concerns about challenges associated with the rollout of the ban, particularly age verification and age assurance measures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ban requires affected social media companies to take \"reasonable steps\" and \"have appropriate measures in place\" to prevent underage users from creating or using accounts. That includes deactivating accounts and implementing age verification measures to prevent new account creation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFailure to do so could attract fines of up to $49.5 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the government has noted there is no one-size-fits-all solution for all companies, age assurance technology might involve using age estimation via AI, facial age analysis, and identity document verification to verify someone's age.\n\n\n\nThe Snapchat executive said there were \"privacy risks\" associated with age assurance technology and said they would be \"supportive\" of device age assurance, which would mean someone's age would be verified when purchasing a device, rather than when apps are downloaded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Google and Apple have not set that up, but we're going to do the best we can to comply,\" Stout said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Age Assurance Technology Trial report, commissioned by the federal government and released in August 2025, said \"age assurance can be done in Australia privately, efficiently and effectively\". It found there were \"no substantial technological limitations\" in its implementation and said \"secure data handling practices\" were available.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle previously told the inquiry the ban would be extremely difficult to enforce, and a lack of detail around how the platforms plan to implement age verification systems has clouded the ban since its announcement.\n\n\n\nNationals senator accuses TikTok of bullying\n\nThe inquiry also witnessed Nationals senator Ross Cadell accuse a TikTok staff member of intimidation and bullying following questions he was asking about the age assurance inquiry.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe alleged a TikTok staff member called his office and said: \"We get on very well with the leader's office, we get on very well with the shadow minister's office. You shouldn't be asking these questions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWoods-Joyce said she was \"not aware of the details that you're talking about\", adding the TikTok team \"needs to operate professionally and appropriately at all times, and I have confidence that that's what we do\".\n\n\n\n\n\nCadell asked Woods-Joyce if TikTok was a \"bullying behemoth that wants to get its own way at any cost\", to which she responded, \"absolutely not\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting by Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The signing of the $13 billion critical minerals deal has exacerbated anxiety in Western Victoria, leaving farmers feeling like \"their voices are not being heard\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're inviting Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to visit the communities that they say will bear the brunt of the proposed mineral mining boom's impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Victorian Farmers Federation letter (VFF), seen by SBS News, expresses \"deep concern\" that in a rush for critical minerals, community concerns will not be addressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Farmers in this region are facing significant uncertainty regarding the future of their land, water, security, and long-term agricultural viability,\" VFF president Brett Hosking wrote to Albanese on Monday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This concern has been compounded by the signing of the recent critical minerals agreement with the United States.\"\n\n\n\nWhile last week's US$300 million ($462 million) in equity commitments focused on projects in Western Australia and the Northern Territory, the government granted Astron Corporation's Donald Rare Earth and Minerals Sands \"major project status\" the following day.\n\n\n\n\n\nHosking said farmers in and around Donald, about 280km north-west of Melbourne, are worried that \"commitments to fast-track projects will further erode their capacity to have a say on the future of their communities\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A visit from you would send a strong signal that the federal government is listening to rural Australians, especially at a time when many feel their voices are not being heard,\" he wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\nAstron says it acknowledges community concerns and continues to engage with locals. The company says the major project status is largely an acknowledgement of the project\u2019s strategic significance, with most major approvals already in place.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plea came hours before the government revealed that the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) reforms, to be tabled in parliament on Thursday, would include an exemption to push through projects deemed in the \"national interest\".\n\n\n\n\n\nA draft section states that Environment Minister Murray Watt can exercise discretion and make a decision \"inconsistent with the national environment standards, where it is demonstrably in the public interest and with a clearly articulated statement of reasons\".\n\n\n\nWhile Labor argues this will improve environmental outcomes, farmers said last week the \"fast tracking\" of projects could impact food production and have broader impacts on surrounding communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nSlow approval times for projects, including the duplication of processes across state and federal governments, have been partially blamed for holding up renewable energy projects as well as the mining of minerals that will allow Australia to compete with China.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere will be a 28-day time limit to challenge the minister's decision, during which work can continue.\n\n\n\nGreens appalled by 'national interest' clause\n\nGreens leader Larissa Waters says the party is still open to negotiations with Labor as long as the reforms \"work for nature\" and \"don't see coal and gas and logging fast-tracked unabated\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They\u2019re [the laws] already riddled with loopholes,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But rather than fix those loopholes, the proposal by this environment minister under this government is to add additional loopholes and yet more fast-track mechanisms for coal and gas.\"\n\n\n\nGreens leader Larissa Waters has accused Labor of creating \"loopholes\" for coal and gas projects in the reforms to environmental law protections. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas Waters says drafts of the legislation are \"written for big business\", predicting that Labor will make a deal with the Coalition instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Business Council of Australia urged the Opposition to pass the bill in full in the Senate, arguing it would offer more certainty for business , after Opposition leader Sussan Ley called on the environmental protections to be split into two sections.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Federal government approves Woodside gas project extension, with some conditions\n\nDespite Watt labelling the proposition \"mad\" on Monday, Opposition environment spokesperson Angie Bell doubled down in her calls to have it split.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to see the Bill split so we can streamline approvals, and we can improve environmental protections separately,\" she told ABC radio on Tuesday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And what we've seen from the Government is a flat refusal immediately. And that's what we kind of expected because it seems that it's their way or the highway.\"\n\n\n\n",

It's almost like they gave the pen to Chevron, and Woodside and Santos to write this version of our environmental laws, that is how convenient it will be for business to trash the place.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition, which also opposes the reforms, is urging Labor to consider splitting the bill into two.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, both parties have been criticised by Professor Graeme Samuel, the author of the 2021 review of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Samuel has urged the parties to set aside their differences and embrace the reforms.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least four people have been killed in clashes with security forces in Cameroon following a tightly contested presidential election that saw the 92-year-old incumbent President Paul Biya returned.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result has been contentious, with hundreds storming the streets of various cities in defiance of a protest ban, claiming opposition candidate Issa Tchiroma Bakary had been denied a legitimate vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want our president, Issa Tchiroma, to come and fix the country. We have suffered enough. Young people are not working. Everyone is suffering. There are no jobs and the country is in chaos. In other words, the crisis in the north is not being resolved. The arms dealers are not being dealt with. Because one person can ruin the country, destroy the country at every level. That means that people are suffering, you see, the whole population has started to lose their jobs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has rejected opposition accusations of irregularities.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Tokyo, a small group of protesters took to the streets to demonstrate against the United States President's plans to meet with Japan's newly elected Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Takaichi will be hoping to impress Donald Trump further - after already making an $842 billion investment pledge in exchange for respite from import tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis 62-year-old protester was among the group of demonstrators that accused the U-S and Japan of waging war against China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The United States and Japan are trying to prolong the life of this capitalist system, this imperialist system, by waging war against China. We're demonstrating today as workers, students and citizens to show our total opposition to this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump is aiming to reach a trade truce when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport now, and in football...\n\n\n\n\n\nMacarthur F-C have brushed off illness to beat Adelaide 2-1 and rise from the bottom of the A-League Men's table.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bulls were without three starting midfielders in Monday night's clash at Campbelltown Stadium, after losing Anthony Caceres, Chris Ikonomidis and Sime Grzan to gastroenteritis.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trio had picked up the illness in Vietnam, where the Bulls drew 1-1 with Cong An Hanoi FC in the ACL Two last Thursday.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "More than 311,000 Australian Facebook users can apply for a slice of a $50 million compensation fund from tech giant Meta \u2014 the largest ever payment for a breach of Australians' privacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the clock is ticking. Even if you're eligible, you only have until 31 December to make your claim. Similar payouts have already started in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom who's eligible, to how to make a claim, to how much the eventual payout might be: here's what you need to know.\n\n\n\nWhy so many Australians can apply?\n\nThe landmark settlement arose from Meta's involvement in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, a massive data breach in the 2010s in which a British data firm harvested private information from 87 million Facebook profiles worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt led to a record-breaking US$5 billion ($7.7 billion) penalty in the US against Meta as Facebook's parent company, and the creation of a US$725 million ($1.1 billion) compensation scheme for affected Americans.\n\n\n\nHere in Australia, an investigation by the national privacy regulator \u2014 the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner \u2014 found Cambridge Analytica used the This Is Your Digital Life personality quiz app to extract personal information.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat investigation found just 53 Australian Facebook users installed the app. But another 311,074 Australian Facebook users were friends of those 53 people, meaning the app could have requested their information too.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn December 2024, the information commissioner announced she had settled a court case with Meta in return for an \"enforceable undertaking\", including a record $50 million payment program.\n\n\n\n\n\nClaims opened on 30 June and close on 31 December.\n\n\n\nWho can apply?\n\nYou can apply if you:\n\n\n\nheld a Facebook account between 2 November 2013 and 17 December 2015 (the eligibility period);\n\n\n\nwere in Australia for more than 30 days during that period, and\n\n\n\neither installed the Life app or were Facebook friends with someone who did.\n\nHow to apply \u2013 but watch for scams\n\nThe Facebook Payment Program is being administered by the consulting firm KPMG. Meta has to pay KPMG to run it; that doesn't come out of the $50 million fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat website is where to go with questions or to lodge a claim.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta has sent all Australians it knows may be eligible this \"token\" notification within Facebook: You may be entitled to receive payment from litigation recently settled in Australia. Learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\nTry this link to see if the company has records of you or your friends logging into the Digital Life app. If there are, you should be able to use the \" fast track \" application.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you didn't get that notification but you think you were affected, you can make a claim using the standard process by proving:\n\n\n\nyour identity, such as with a passport or driver's licence\n\n\n\nyou held a Facebook account and were located in Australia during the eligibility period.\n\nBut watch out for scammers pretending to be from Facebook or to be helping with claims.\n\n\n\nWhich payout could you be eligible for?\n\nYou need to choose to apply for compensation under one of two \"classes\", requiring different types of proof.\n\n\n\n\n\nClass 1: the harder option, expected to get higher payouts\n\n\n\n\n\nTo claim for \"specific loss or damage\", you'll need to provide documented evidence of economic and/or non-economic loss or damage. For example, this could include out-of-pocket medical or counselling costs, or having to move if your personal details were made public.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou'll also need to show damage was caused by the Cambridge Analytica data breach. For many people, proving extensive loss or damage may be difficult.\n\n\n\nClass 1 claims will be decided first. There are no predetermined payout amounts; each will be decided individually.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf your class 1 claim is unsuccessful, but you're otherwise eligible for a payout, you will be able to get a class 2 payout instead.\n\n\n\n\n\nClass 2: the easier option, likely to get smaller payouts\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can choose to claim only for loss or damage based on \"a generalised concern or embarrassment\" caused by the data breach.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a much easier process \u2014 but also likely to be a much smaller payment.\n\n\n\nAll class 2 claimants will receive the same amount, after the class 1 payouts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese claimants only need to provide a statutory declaration that they have a genuine belief the breach caused them concern or embarrassment.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Meta's enforceable undertaking with the information commissioner, it states KPMG is able to apply a cap on payments to claimants. It also states if there is money left after all the payouts, KPMG will pay that amount to the Australian government's Consolidated Revenue Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta told The Conversation: \"There is not a predetermined cap on payments.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The appropriate time to determine whether any cap should apply to payments made to claimants is following the end of the registration period [December 31].\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it's not yet clear how much of the $50 million fund will go to Australian claimants versus how much could end up going to the federal government.\n\n\n\n\n\nPayments are expected to be made from around August 2026.\n\n\n\nHow much are payouts likely to be?\n\nPayouts from similar settlements by Meta elsewhere have been very small. For example, US Facebook users eligible for their US$725 million ($1,100 million) compensation scheme have expressed surprise at the size of their payouts. One report suggests the average US payment is around US$30 ($45) each.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere in Australia, a lot will depend on how many people bother to register between now and 31 December.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraham Greenleaf is an honorary professor at Macquarie Law School, Macquarie University.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a victory for Australian creators, the Albanese government is definitively ruling out giving tech giants free rein to mine creative content for training Artificial Intelligence models.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Recording Industry Association's chief executive Anna Bell has told the ABC that it was a \"critical step in the right direction.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government has stood up and backed in copyright law as well as artists, creators and rights holders. And basically what they're saying is we will not agree to dilute and weaken our copyright laws so that a small number of very large tech companies can have free and open access to very important and valuable cultural works.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRequested by sections of the tech sector, the so-called \u201ctext and mining\u201d exemption was floated by the productivity commission in their August interim report into harnessing data and digital technology.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report suggested that AI could boost the economy by $116 billion over a decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the proposal faced immediate denunciation from the creative sector and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, who argued it would give tech giants a \"free pass\" for the rampant theft of creative work, and deprive Australian artists of valuable income.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment Minister Murray Watt says that's not what the government wants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Albanese Government are a strong supporter of our arts community and we recognise that they deserve their fair share for their efforts in producing product, as do media organisations. One of the things that we know about AI is that while it can produce enormous productivity gains and many benefits for us on a personal level, we also need to have proper safeguards in place to make sure that in this case artists, media organisations, creatives get their fair share from their work and that's why we will not be providing an exemption for what's known as text and data mining for AI companies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTom Sulston from Digital Rights Watch has told SBS that while the government's decision to scrap the text and data mining exemption is welcome, it doesn't go far enough.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe argues that protections shouldn't stop with professional creatives but must be extended to cover all Australians' social media content, private information, and biometric data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sure at the moment, the AI companies are able to ingest content from social media without gathering the consent of the people who have written it. Most social media companies will have a Terms of Use that essentially say anything you put into their system they can do whatever they want with. And we don't think that is sufficient. As individuals, we still control that data, so it's important that we're allowed to say, I don't want this to be part of an AI training thing or used for something that I don't want it to be used for. And then similarly, our personal and private information is also up for grabs by AI companies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Sulston says that while Australian's browse the internet, the private data they generate can be used by big tech for anything from profiling to targeted ads.\n\n\n\n\n\nCalling this a \"huge power imbalance,\" he argues that it leaves citizens little control over their own lives, proposing a change in privacy law to address the issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So we're calling for a right to delete provision in the upcoming Privacy Act review that will allow us to say, hey, you know, I gave a company some data because we were doing, you know, some business together, and now I want to revoke that permission, and they are not allowed to use my data for whatever other purposes they might be putting it to.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the government is completely ruling out a \"text and data mining\" exemption, Federal Attorney-General Michelle Rowland has told the ABC that the work is not over.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, the 'reconstituted copyright and AI reference group' is convening to determine the path forward.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Rowland says that while Australia\u2019s Copyright Act is 'robust,' it must also accommodate the challenges of AI.\n\n\n\n",

Russia has been able to find workarounds to counter earlier sanctions and the price caps the G7 economies have imposed on its exports. An oil field in Siberia. About 80 per cent of Russia\u2019s oil exports have now been targeted by the US and the European Union. Credit: Bloomberg It has developed a vast \u201cshadow\u201d fleet of tankers that have shipped its oil, albeit at discounts to global prices, to countries including China, India and Turkey. They have been prepared to ignore the sanctions.\n\nThe American intervention, and the threat of secondary sanctions that threaten to cut off access to the US and US dollar-denominated global financial system, has, however, already had an impact. Loading Chinese state-owned companies and India\u2019s major refineries \u2013 Russia\u2019s two biggest customers \u2013 have already suspended seaborne imports of Russian oil while they work through the implications of the sanctions. They can\u2019t afford to be shut out of the global financial system. China\u2019s purchases of Russian oil and assistance for its war efforts will inevitably come up in this week\u2019s head-to-head discussions between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump\u2019s 50 per cent tariff on India\u2019s exports to the US might also become a discussion point between the US and India if the US is serious about throttling Russia\u2019s oil revenues. Russia will almost inevitably find some sort of workaround \u2013 it\u2019s shown how resourceful and creative its oil exporters can be \u2013 but there will be some squeezing of its oil exports and, if it is to largely maintain export volumes, it will probably come at the cost of even bigger discounts to global prices.\n\nThe EU and United Kingdon (but not the US), last month reduced the price cap on Russian oil (backed by the threat of sanctions and loss of insurance cover) from the $US60 a barrel cap imposed in late 2022 to $US47.60 a barrel. Russia\u2019s flagship crude had been selling at $US12 to $US13 a barrel discounts to the previous cap. To maintain export volumes now that Rosneft and Lukoil have been sanctioned, Russia may well have to increase the scale of its discounts even as the cost of establishing new and more expensive ways of circumventing the sanctions increases. With oil exports accounting for about one-third of Russia\u2019s budget revenues and those revenues already under pressure from a slowing economy and an inflation rate running above 8 per cent, the impact of the sanctions on Russia\u2019s economy \u2013 if the US polices them effectively \u2013 could be material. That economy has held up far better than expected when the West first responded to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine with sanctions and the seizure of about $US300 billion ($457.4 billion) of Russia\u2019s offshore foreign exchange reserves, largely because Vladimir Putin rapidly switched its structure away from a market-driven economy to a wartime economy.\n\nPerversely, that generated increased growth, reduced unemployment and significant increases in wages as more and more of Russia\u2019s industrial base \u2013 and its citizens \u2013 were devoted to the war effort. There are, however, now signs of strain. Russia\u2019s industrial base is now devoted to producing goods that, once deployed in the war, produce no recurrent economic benefit. Investment has flowed away from other activities into military spending, increasingly starving non-military activity of funds. With oil inventories bulging and expanding and OPEC still sitting on millions of barrels a day of unused capacity, any reduction in the flow of Russian oil into the global market could be absorbed without massive price impacts. The expansion of the Russian military, and the need to replace the hundreds of thousands who have died and the other hundreds of thousands that have been wounded, is producing shortages of workers across the economy while driving up wages and inflation. Resources have been concentrated in Moscow and military centres, drawing them away from the regions and causing financial stresses and degrading services in some of Russia\u2019s poorer regions.\n\nFrom a remarkably positive 4.3 per cent growth in GDP last year, even Russia\u2019s own forecasters see growth of only about 1 per cent this year. The International Monetary Fund and World Bank both forecast growth of less than 1 per cent this year and not much more over the next few years. Loading Last week Russia\u2019s central bank cut its policy rate by 0.5 of a percentage point, to 16.5 per cent. It had been as high as 21 per cent. Economic growth of 1per cent or less and inflation of 8 per cent or more equals stagflation. Russia\u2019s economy is stagnating, with the inflation rate eroding the value of the revenues and taxes available for military spending, which accounts for about 40 per cent of Moscow\u2019s spending and about 8 per cent of GDP \u2013 about twice the amount spent before the invasion. Moscow is budgeting for flat defence and security expenditures in 2025-26. That implies a reduction in real terms and signals how tight the country\u2019s finances now are even though the government has been increasing fees, fines, taxes on individuals and companies and has foreshadowed an increase in the country\u2019s value-added tax rate to 22 per cent and a broadening of that tax\u2019s base.",

        "text": "She was sufficiently connected, however, to be in Epstein\u2019s seven-storey townhouse in Manhattan in December 2010. Unbeknownst to Epstein and Andrew, a photographer was watching them. Keating was seen leaving the house as Andrew waved her farewell at the front door. Loading Her misfortune was to be in the house at what turned out to be a pivotal moment. Epstein and Andrew went for a walk in Central Park \u2013 and the photographer, Jae Donnelly, took the shot that proved they were back in touch. Andrew chose to keep up his friendship with a man convicted of sex with a minor. Keating has never talked about why she was at Epstein\u2019s house that December. But she confirmed she went to the dinner in February. \u201cIt was a large social event,\u201d she told The Daily Mail, and she mentioned prominent media personalities who also attended. \u201cA sizeable chunk of NY society was there, including Barbara Walters, Charlie Rose and Katie Couric. At the time, I had only lived in NY about 10 weeks, and was happy to accept the odd social invitation.\u201d\n\nShe could not be contacted by this masthead for comment. All of this is fuel for those who assume the guilt of anyone who came near Epstein. Social media has spread slurs about Keating for years because of the townhouse photo. Some will add the email to the mix. But the public interest is slim. Keating does not hold any public office. She is under no obligation to answer questions about her private life. The main reason for looking into the new email is to counter the conspiracies. One assumption, for instance, is that Keating knew Maxwell and moved in the same circles as Epstein. In fact, there is no evidence that she knew Maxwell before 2014, when she interviewed her for a project called IdeaPod, published by the Huffington Post. Another assumption is that she was very close to Andrew. Instead, the friendship seems to have been with his daughters, Princess Eugenie and Princess Beatrice. Keating was photographed with Eugenie at Fashion Week in New York in 2014.\n\nAt the risk of labouring the point, there are no grounds for suggesting an intimate relationship with Andrew. Prince Andrew is under renewed pressure over his links with Epstein. Credit: AP Nor is there a reason to think Keating knew all the murky details about Epstein. The plea deal meant some of the facts did not see the light of day until years later. Keating was not alone in walking too close to the spider\u2019s web. Epstein drew many people around him from 2010 onwards, when he regained his place in New York society. Some of them were his accomplices. Others were simply invited to dinner. He used donations to charities, amplified by publicists, to try to bury the past. One New York publicist, Peggy Siegal, ensured he was invited to events. Siegal told The New York Times in 2019 that she had no trouble restarting their friendship after his prison term: \u201cThe culture before #MeToo was \u2013 \u2018You\u2019ve done your time, now you\u2019re forgiven\u2019.\u201d\n\nSiegal arranged a dinner party for Prince Andrew at Epstein\u2019s mansion in 2010, according to The New York Times. Those at the dinner included filmmaker Woody Allen and his wife, Soon-Yi Previn, as well as broadcasters Charlie Rose, Katie Couric and George Stephanopoulos. Loading Turning up to dinner did not make someone an Epstein accomplice. It might demonstrate poor judgment, or ignorance, but not necessarily guilt. Comedian Chelsea Handler attended the 2010 dinner, for instance, and later said she had no idea who Epstein was. She also asked a pointed question of Allen and his wife: \u201cSo, how did you two meet?\u201d Two key conclusions emerge from the email about Keating, Epstein and the prince. The first is that there is no evidence that Keating did anything wrong. The second is that Andrew is utterly exposed. This is the second email to emerge within the last two weeks that confirms he misled the public when he claimed that he cut off contact with Epstein on the day they walked in Central Park in December 2010.",

        "text": "A Tesla driver is desperately hoping officials can track the source of a foreign object that crashed into his windscreen while he and his wife were driving through farmland earlier this month.\n\nSouth Australian Dr Andrew Melville-Smith is lucky to be alive after the sudden collision sent \"hot\" shards of glass throughout the car, and it may even be a \"world-first\" occurrence.\n\nThe vet was driving his new Tesla on the Augusta Highway, 40km north of Port Germein, at 9pm on Sunday, October 19, when the frightening incident took place.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt's suspected that the object may have been a meteorite plummeting from space, with scientists keen to trace the object for further inspection.\n\nAndrew said it was \"pitch-black\" at the time, but it was an otherwise clear evening. He said the pair were cruising along the road listening to a podcast when they were jolted by \"a very, very violent explosion\".\n\n\"We had just picked up a new Tesla and we were driving up to Whyalla ... it was pitch black and the weather was calm \u2014 there was no rain or lightning or anything like that,\" he told ABC News Breakfast on Tuesday.\n\n\"Then there was, [what] I can only describe as a very, very violent explosion. The whole inside of the car was literally blasted with glass fragments. It was full of white smoke, and it smelled like the car was on fire.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe crash left Andrew \"stunned\" for a good 10 seconds, he said. \"I was covered in glass. My wife said, 'Oh, the car's blown up',\" he recalled. Dramatic imagery shows the massive crack in the windscreen left by the flying rock, which Andrew said was hot to the touch.\n\nRemarkably, the Tesla, in self-driving mode at the time, carried on as if nothing had occurred.\n\nThe 'crater' left by the collision was 'hot to the touch'.

After we pulled over, we saw the big crater in the windscreen.\"\n\nCould Tesla driver's 'meteorite collision' be a world first?\n\nThe 71-year-old reported the unusual incident to the South Australian Museum. According to Geologist Dr Kieran Meaney, the damage to the windshield suggested a meteorite might be responsible, but it was too soon to confirm the exact cause.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"The little detail that\u2019s really selling it for me at the moment is that whatever it was that hit the windscreen seems to have been very hot,\" Mr Meaney told The Adelaide Advertiser, noting the discolouration where the plastic laminate had been scorched.\n\nAndrew wasn't able to locate the meteorite, but there is hope that fragments in the windshield may offer clues as to the source of the foreign object.\n\n\u201cBut until we can actually find the object and have a good look at the windscreen ourselves, we can\u2019t say for certain what it was,\" Meaney said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf it's confirmed, it could be the first reported incident of its kind. Andrew said he had been \"hit by rocks a few times\" while driving over the years, but this instance was markedly different.\n\n\"As I recovered from the shock of it, I had to wipe all the glass, because I was just covered in grass fragments. This was nothing like a rock,\" he said.\n\n\"A rock, you see them, you hear them. With this, there was no warning; it was just a huge explosion as you were driving along.\" Andrew is now in the process of organising researchers at the museum to examine the windscreen.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
