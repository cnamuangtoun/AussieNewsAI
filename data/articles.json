(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan)\n\nOn August 1, new regulations in Hong Kong came into effect, allowing companies to apply for a licence to issue stablecoins.\n\nUnlike more typical cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, whose value fluctuates wildly, the value of stablecoins is pegged to that of currencies or commodities, removing the volatility that deters some investors.\n\nThey don't just account for pocket change, either.\n\nAccording to ANZ, stablecoin transactions were worth $US27.6 trillion ($42.5 trillion) last year alone.\n\nThat's more than all transactions made using Visa and Mastercard combined, and about 15 times the value of the entire Australian economy.\n\nHong Kong isn't the only jurisdiction to regulate stablecoins recently.\n\nUS President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act (officially the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act) on July 18, one of three major bills to clear the House during what was touted as \"crypto week\".\n\nUnlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, stablecoins' value is intended to be more reliable. (AP Photo/Kin Cheung)\n\n\"The regulations in the US and Hong Kong have attracted significant market attention,\" ANZ chief greater China economist Raymond Yeung wrote.\n\n\"Companies involved in issuing and trading stablecoins have seen their stock prices rally massively.\"\n\nIn Australia, meanwhile, the RBA has ruled out the idea of a central bank digital currency for now, but announced the start of a trial of tokenised currencies\ufeff, including stablecoins, in July.\n\nNot that everyone thinks they're a good idea.\n\nLaw professor and prominent crypto critic Hilary Allen compared the GENIUS Act to the pre-regulated financial era that led to the Great Depression.\n\nDonald Trump signed the GENIUS Act to regulate stablecoins last month. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\n\"It won't just be crypto taking advantage, it'll be everybody,\" Allen told CNN last month.\n\n\"And then we get to unregulated markets for all kinds of investments, which is where we were in the 1920s, and we saw how that ended.\"\ufeff\n\nThe Hong Kong regulations come as some Chinese tech giants, including e-commerce behemoth JD.com and the Alibaba-linked Ant Group, have reportedly pushed Beijing to allow stablecoins linked to the yuan to counter the surge of US dollar-backed crypto.\n\nMore than a few commentators and analysts have talked of Hong Kong acting as a testing ground for the mainland.\n\n\"The emergence of stablecoins in the 2020s gave hope to the internationalisation of the (yuan), and the passing of Hong Kong's stablecoins ordinance was viewed as a further step in that direction,\" Yeung said.\n\nAt the same time, it's no secret China wants to get away from the reliance on the US dollar in international transactions, and promote the yuan in its place.\n\nSo could a yuan-backed stablecoin offer a way to do just that?\n\nREAD MORE: Where your dog sits in the car could cost you thousands in fines \ufeff\n\nChina wants to decouple from the US dollar and promote its own currency in its place. (Chinatopix via AP)\n\nAccording to Yeung, even if Beijing does allow them, a stablecoin on its own won't drive dedollarisation \u2013 it'll come down to a host of other factors.\n\n\"Some observers think it could help,\" he wrote.\n\n\"But it's likely any currency diversification will depend on the popularity of the yuan, rather than any one technology\u2026\n\n\"Should China want to allocate less foreign reserve to $US, then stablecoins backed by other currencies are the alternative, not the yuan-backed stablecoin.\n\n\"The issuance of yuan-backed stablecoin requires sufficient high-quality liquid assets.\n\n\"This could be limited by the issuers' access to renminbi deposits, offshore China sovereign and sub-sovereign bonds and their access to the onshore bond market.\n\n\"Stablecoin issuance, and their reserve funds, will increase demand for these assets.\n\n\"But ultimately, the success of renminbi internationalisation will drive yuan-backed stablecoins \u2014 not the other way round.\"",

(Supplied: Chris Frape)\n\nGreen Music Australia's research from its NSW Venue Sustainability Health Check, released this year, found venues could save an average of $10,388 each year through environmental improvements.\n\nThis included changes like switching energy providers, improving efficiency through appliance maintenance and installing solar power.\n\nVenues could also reduce their electricity emissions to zero by switching their energy contract to GreenPower, which uses 100 per cent renewable electricity and is available through most energy retailers in Australia.\n\n\"We're trying to help venues do better for the planet, but there's some great opportunities to save money,\" Green Music Australia spokesperson Emma Bosworth told ABC Illawarra Drive.\n\n\"We launched the certification because Green Music Australia works with labels and artists and they were asking us, 'Where should we book our shows?

(ABC Central West: Hamish Cole)\n\nMs Webb said while farmers understood the impacts of climate change, she wanted to see a \"better balance\" with the rollout of renewables.\n\n\"People in the cities delegate the enormous responsibility of growing their food to farmers and we do that under very difficult circumstances,\" she said.\n\n\" Now we are also being lumped with the burden of energy production. \"\n\nLatest wind project\n\nMs Webb is president of the Binalong Bowning Community Action Group, which has been created in opposition to the latest renewable energy proposal in the area.\n\nThe company Wind Prospect is preparing a scoping report for the Bendenine Wind Farm that would feature up to 90 turbines, each 260 metres tall.\n\nEmma Webb's property near Binalong has been in her family for three generations. (ABC Central West: Hamish Cole)\n\nThe project would be located less than 2 kilometres from Ms Webb's home.\n\n\"The consequence is that our home, our community, our landscape will never be the same again,\" she said.\n\n\"There are huge impacts being felt from this proposal immediately.\"\n\nWind Prospect said it understood concerns about the number of renewable energy projects proposed across the region.\n\n\"Cumulative impacts, including social factors, will be carefully assessed as part of the Environmental Impact Statement,\" a Wind Prospect spokesperson said.\n\n\" We remain committed to open, respectful engagement and to delivering a well-considered project that minimises impacts and brings lasting local benefits. \"\n\nCouncil pressure\n\nYass Valley Council, where Ms Webb lives, has passed a motion calling for the state government to stop approving renewable projects in the district.\n\nMayor Jasmin Jones said 18,000 people lived in her community and existing wind and solar projects generated enough power for 500,000 homes.\n\nJasmin Jones says the shire has done enough to support renewable energy. (ABC Central West: Hamish Cole)\n\n\"We are not NIMBYs [Not In My Backyard], we have clearly done some heavy lifting,\" Cr Jones said.\n\n\" There seems to be no line in the sand coming from the state or federal government. \"\n\nThe council does not fall within one of the five renewable energy zones (REZ) the state government identified in 2021 as being ideal locations for wind and solar power.\n\nProponents of REZ wind farms were required to engage with councils and residents over community funding programs, consultation sessions and neighbourhood agreements among affected landholders.\n\nOpposition to renewable energy projects has been growing in the region. (ABC Central West: Hamish Cole)\n\nSince 2021, there have been 22 renewable energy projects approved within the REZs, while 25 have been given the go-ahead outside the five zones.\n\n\"These companies have really cottoned on that it is easier to get their projects approved in non-REZs,\" Cr Jones said.\n\nIn a statement, NSW Minister for Planning and Public Spaces Paul Scully said the guidelines for renewable projects ensured that communities received \"equitable benefit\" as part of the planning process.\n\n\"The guidelines are transparent, community-focused and deliver positive, tangible and long-term socio-economic benefits.\"\n\nMr Scully said the planning process for renewables projects assessed the \"social and environmental impacts,\" and how they could be managed.\n\nRural communities targeted\n\nThe neighbouring Upper Lachlan Shire is home to more than one-third of the state's operational wind turbines.\n\nThe Bango Wind Farm near Boorowa hosts 46 turbines. (ABC Central West: Hamish Cole)\n\nIn June, councillors voted 5-4 against a motion calling for the shire to be exempt from further renewable energy developments.\n\nMayor Paul Culhane said the way in which the transition to renewables was occurring was turning people away from the energy source.\n\n\"Everywhere we drive in the shire we will be seeing turbines,\" Cr Culhane said.\n\n\"It is starting to turn public opinion against renewable energy in our area, which I think is not in the national interest.\"\n\nThe Upper Lachlan Shire and Yass Valley Council are mostly made up of agricultural land. (ABC Central West: Hamish Cole)\n\nCr Culhane said there needed to be a change in how projects were assessed to ensure rural councils were not unfairly targeted.\n\n\"The framework of the planning instruments for this are pushing them towards small communities with not a lot of people and a lot of space,\" he said.\n\n\"We don't want to become a dumping ground.\"",

(ABC South West WA: Pip Waller)\n\nSamantha Enticknap runs a make-up business in Margaret River, 271 kilometres south of Perth, and said all of her social media accounts were suspended on July 14.\n\n\"I opened my email and saw due to sexually explicit content and nudity with children I had been suspended,\" Ms Enticknap said.\n\n\"I have a make-up page with pictures of make-up on women. There's no nudity.\n\n\" It was horrifying to see this accusation and it really affected both my business and myself emotionally. \"\n\n'Breach of community standards'\n\nMs Enticknap was told by Meta her account had been suspended because it had breached the tech company's community standards.\n\nCindy Kempton runs a fitness company across the Kimberley and the Pilbara and has been without her social media pages for six weeks.\n\nMeta, again, cited child abuse material as the reason for the suspension.\n\n\"Which is completely untrue. We very rarely, if ever, put children up on our Instagram because of the regulations surrounding children,\" Ms Kempton said.\n\nThe social media pages of six of Cindy Kempton's fitness companies were removed after they were flagged by Meta.

(Supplied)\n\nThe ABC understands Meta uses a combination of humans and AI technology to find and remove accounts that break its rules.\n\nHowever, according to the tech giant, there has been no increase in incorrect enforcement of its rules.\n\nIn a statement, a Meta spokesperson said the company took action on accounts that violated its policies.\n\n\"People can appeal if they think we've made a mistake,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n'Own the house, own the land'\n\nThe Small Business Development Corporation is a WA government agency that provides free advice to small businesses across the state.\n\nDirector Caragh Waller said a lot of businesses were under the misapprehension that their business page was their asset, but that was not the case when it was through a private company such as Meta.\n\n\"We would advise businesses to be careful about having all your eggs in the Meta basket,\" Ms Waller said.\n\n\"It's akin to building a house on someone else's land. Your house is your business, so make sure you own the land.\n\n\"It's a huge financial hit [for these businesses], but it's also reputational damage to be linked to something quite unsavoury on the internet.\"\n\nWhen questioned by the ABC, Meta restored Ms Enticknap's accounts, but Ms Kempton remains offline.\n\nCindy Kempton says the closure of her Meta accounts has caused a string of issues for her business. (ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\nIn the space of three weeks, Ms Enticknap said she had an 80 per cent loss in revenue.\n\n\"It's just a minefield of knowing who to speak to, who to go to, how we get our businesses back,\" she said.\n\n\"We're just small businesses trying to make money.\n\n\"Just give us an explanation of what we've done and a better review process.\"",

        "text": "Some people are also looking for natural alternatives, and they say skin irritation they have experienced from certain products has caused them to shift from conventional products. As a result, alternatives like homemade creams and mineral-based sunscreens have become more popular. Some people are also choosing to stop using sunscreen entirely. \u201cI am definitely a MAHA mom and voted for Trump so that RFK Jr could get into office,\u201d says Summer Whiteside, 31, an ER nurse from Wildomar, California, in a text message. \u201cAfter listening to his podcast on Joe Rogan, I knew he was the man for the job.\u201d On Instagram, Whiteside \u2013 who doesn\u2019t shy away from the label \u201ccrunchy\u201d \u2013 posts about things like beef tallow for sunburns and her preference for mineral sunscreen. Whiteside, who says she has concerns about the chemicals in sunscreen, uses long-sleeved rash guards on her kids and sunblock only on their faces. Some wellness figures have claimed that diet changes or building sun exposure gradually can protect against burns, which dermatologists and the scientific community strongly recommend against. Some in the anti-sunscreen movement point to studies suggesting that certain chemicals cause cancer or are absorbed too heavily into the body. But public health experts say there are no human studies that conclusively prove ingredients like oxybenzone act as carcinogens.\n\n\u201cOxybenzone has been used since the 1970s in sunscreen, so we would have found out by now if it caused harm,\u201d says Henry W Lim, senior vice president of academic affairs and former chair of dermatology at Henry Ford Health. Lim says that some groups will use testing methods and safety thresholds in studies that differ from those required for product approval in the United States. \u201cA lot of the concerns come from animal studies using high doses, but those results don\u2019t automatically translate to humans,\u201d says Lim, who is also the president of the International League of Dermatological Societies and a past president of the American Academy of Dermatology. Dermatologists say sunscreen is important for protecting skin from melanoma, at any age. Credit: Getty Images What do health experts and science say?\n\nHealth professionals warn that anti-sunscreen messaging can be harmful for the public because skin cancer remains one of the most common types of cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. Experts say sunscreen is one of the most effective tools for prevention. Adam Friedman, a professor and chair of dermatology at George Washington University, says scepticism of sunscreen is nothing new. Concerns about chemical ingredients and mistrust in federal oversight resurface every few years, often fuelled by social media and wellness trends. But he says the science has remained consistent. \u201cUltraviolet radiation is a known carcinogen; there is no debate about that,\u201d Friedman says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had decades of data showing that sunscreen plays a critical role in reducing skin cancer risk.\u201d Loading Studies have shown that regular sunscreen use significantly reduces the risk of skin cancer. A randomised controlled trial in Australia, known as the Nambour Skin Cancer Prevention Trial, followed more than 1,600 participants for about 10 years. Those who used sunscreen daily had a lower incidence of melanoma compared with those who used it occasionally.\n\nAnother prospective cohort study of more than 143,000 Norwegian women found that using an SPF 15 or higher sunscreen was associated with a 33 per cent lower risk of melanoma, compared with people using less than an SPF 15 or none at all. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, even on cloudy days. Mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are considered safe by dermatologists. Veena Vanchinathan, a board-certified dermatologist in California and a member of the American Academy of Dermatology, says the hesitation regarding sunscreen use in wellness spaces is not supported by current scientific evidence. She explained that just because a sunscreen ingredient is absorbed into the body doesn\u2019t mean it is harmful. \u201cWe see small amounts of absorption from many everyday products without any proven risk,\u201d Vanchinathan says. \u201cOur skin is designed to function as a barrier, not a sponge.\u201d Her bigger concern is that people are skipping sunscreen altogether or using ineffective unproven alternatives like coconut oil or beef tallow. This could lead to more preventable sun damage, especially among younger people who are influenced by wellness content online.\n\nIn the US, the Food and Drug Administration regulates sunscreen, but standards have not kept up. The last major sunscreen monograph proposal came in 1999. This document serves as the FDA\u2019s official guideline for which ingredients can be used in over-the-counter sunscreens. Although the agency has proposed updates in recent years, delays have left many newer active ingredients \u2013 which are already used in Europe and Asia \u2013 unavailable in the U.S. This regulatory delay has drawn criticism from dermatologists and public health experts who say the U.S. is falling behind global standards and giving consumers fewer safe options. Some people, frustrated by the lack of innovation, are turning to imported products or homemade solutions, which Friedman strongly discourages. \u201cWould you make Tylenol or Advil in your bathtub?\u201d Friedman said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to replicate the safety, testing and effectiveness of a professionally formulated sunscreen.\u201d Other countries often approve sunscreen filters faster by following a different regulatory model that emphasises post-market surveillance and international data. The European Commission evaluates sunscreen ingredients under a cosmetics framework that allows newer filters to reach the market more quickly.",

The Magpies\u2019 woes have allowed them to jump into second spot (on percentage), and the double chance is surely now within keeping. The Swans loomed as their only challenge in the final month, so Sunday\u2019s clash will be a good hitout for Chris Scott and his men. Best case: First. Worst case: Fourth. Refreshed: Patrick Dangerfield was afforded a rest against Essendon. Credit: Getty Images\n\nCollingwood What we say: This has been some fall from grace for a team that last month was 10 points clear on top of the ladder. The Magpies have since dropped four of their past five games, and appear a shell of the fluent, ball-moving side we had become accustomed to. The Magpies looked old and slow against the Hawks, and appeared too heavily reliant on Nick Daicos for creativity. The absence again of a concussed Jeremy Howe weakens a fragile defence. Now come the rampaging Crows. Surely, the Magpies will at least beat the Demons in round 24 \u2026 or so we think. Best case: First. Worst case: Sixth. Main man: The Magpies appear overly reliant on Nick Daicos for their ball movement. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Fremantle\n\nWhat we say: While the Crows have won the plaudits, the Dockers are just as hot. They have won five on the bounce, and 11 of their past 12 games, their only loss by 11 points to Sydney. They are playing a more attacking game, and the results are showing. Now comes arguably the toughest fortnight of the prospective finalists. Win both and a top-two berth could be within reach.

Wow. The loss of Lachie Neale for the remainder of the home-and-away season has hurt. The Swans troubled the Lions by going by hand as often as possible from defence on Saturday \u2013 a tactic others, surely, will follow. That\u2019s two losses in three weeks, with the Dockers to come in Perth. Lose that, and the double chance could be all but a memory. Huge week ahead. Best case: Third. Worst case: Eighth. Hobbled: Lachie Neale won\u2019t play again until the finals. Credit: via Getty Images Gold Coast What we say: It\u2019s always felt a touch odd to believe the Suns could earn the double chance, because we know their finals history \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 all too well. But with an extra game up their sleeve (the rescheduled clash against Essendon), the double chance is within reach. They should take care of the Giants this week, while the Power, at home, are still a major challenge. We\u2019ll back the Suns in to win both, leaving the Bombers clash to ultimately determine their fate. Best case: Second. Worst case: Ninth.\n\nWithin reach: Ben King and the Gold Coast Suns are on the cusp of a maiden finals run. Credit: AFL Photos Hawthorn What we say: Hokball is back, and the Hawks deserve praise. We were worried about their finals hopes, even last month tipping they would miss the top eight. But a strong performance on the road against the Crows, and a crushing win over Collingwood (we changed our projection last week and tipped the Hawks), have them all but certain finalists. They should take care of business against the Demons, leaving the trip north on the final Sunday of the home-and-away season to determine their top-four hopes. Best case: Fourth. Worst case: Ninth.

After their shocker against the Bulldogs, our top-eight projections had the Giants missing September on percentage. That was dependent on them losing to the Suns next weekend. However, if they can flip that script and win, and then take care of the Saints, they should be in. A top-four finish, though, appears a step too far. Best case: Fifth. Worst case: Ninth. Hanging on: The Giants are clinging to a finals berth. Credit: via Getty Images Western Bulldogs\n\nWhat we say: The Dogs got out of jail against the Demons to remain in the finals hunt. Had they lost, their season would have been all but over. However, Hawthorn\u2019s win over the Magpies hasn\u2019t helped the Dogs\u2019 cause, because they are running out of teams they can replace in the top eight. They will knock over the Eagles next Sunday. Then comes a season-defining clash against the Dockers. Best case: Sixth. Worst case: Ninth. On the edge: Marcus Bontempelli and his Bulldogs may miss the finals. Credit: Getty Images How we think it will play out",

For now, it is a story of \u201clow hiring\u201d. It becomes dangerous if companies start firing as well. That can turn into a self-feeding downward spiral of mass layoffs that slips control, forcing the Fed to slash rates to the bone. US jobs growth ground to a screeching halt in May and June, just as labour economists had predicted. Credit: Bloomberg The US property market is already crying out for relief. Mortgage applications have collapsed to the levels of the mid-1990s. The Freddie Mac house price index has fallen for the past five months in a row. Property owners in south-west Florida are slashing prices at the fastest rate since the subprime bust in 2007-08. Wall Street has shrugged off the slowdown, but that is because traders are betting on the \u201cFed put\u201d \u2013 Vickie Chang, from Goldman Sachs, says markets have priced in both a \u201cnegative US growth shock\u201d and a \u201cdoveish policy shock\u201d at the same time.\n\nThe two more or less offset each other. In other words, the Fed will ensure that the Schiller price-to-earnings ratio on Wall Street remains near the peak of the dotcom bubble at over 38, and junk bond spreads remain as compressed as they were at the peak of the Lehman credit bubble. Uncle Jerome will keep investors fat and happy. Loading The Fed will undoubtedly cut rates, but it is an invidious position. The next shocker may well be the core inflation figures out next week. The delayed effects of the tariffs are about to feed through with malicious and unstoppable force. Welcome to 1970s Nixonian stagflation. Donald Trump will doubtless declare that the index has been manipulated by Marxist fifth columnists. Good luck with that. The US is unable to substitute 90 per cent of its current imports with local production. Trump\u2019s trade taxes will be paid by US consumers via higher prices, and by US companies with plants abroad or reliance on foreign inputs via lower profit margins. Caterpillar has already warned that the Trump levy will cost it up to $US1.5 billion ($2.3 billion) a year. Brewer Molson Coors expects earnings to fall by 7 to 10 per cent because Trump\u2019s 50 per cent tariffs on aluminium have pushed metal can costs through the roof.\n\nWe know from early warning signals \u2013 both the ISM\u2019s service price paid index and S&P Global\u2019s composite PMI output prices \u2013 that price impulse is filtering through with the usual multi-month lag, and that headline inflation will approach an annualised rate near 5 per cent over the next three months. Durable goods prices are already rising at the fastest rate since the early 1990s. The Yale Budget Lab expects food and apparel prices to rise by almost 40 per cent. The Fed will undoubtedly cut rates, but it is an invidious position. Britain and Europe are in a different position. They are absorbing the brunt of China\u2019s galactic overcapacity, and absorbing some of its deflation too as a wave of cheap Chinese exports are diverted from the US and into their markets. They are not committing further economic self-harm by raising inflationary trade taxes themselves. I can understand the reasons for the hawkish tone of the Bank of England\u2019s rate cut on Thursday, but lingering worries of UK inflation may soon be washed away by larger global forces. \u201cThe Bank will be compelled to cut faster in 2026,\u201d said Mathieu Savary, of BCA Research, who thinks that deflation is the greater danger stalking Europe.\n\nThe eurozone\u2019s rebound has stalled. The growth spurt earlier this year was an illusion of \u201ctariff front-running\u201d. German industrial output fell 1.9 per cent in June. It is down 4 per cent from a year ago, and 10 per cent below its pre-pandemic level. \u201cIt\u2019s a cold shower for our long-held view of a cyclical rebound in German industry,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, of ING. Brzeski said Germany\u2019s Mittelstand family firms cannot blunt the impact of the tariffs by relocating production to the US. These firms have always formed the backbone of the Wirtschaftswunder (or economic miracle). They are being hammered on a second front by China, which has moved up the technology ladder and is now competing toe to toe in third markets, with the help of a suppressed exchange rate.\n\nKeynesian rearmament and a blitz of infrastructure spending will eventually lift Germany out of the doldrums. The Merz government is swinging from a primary budget surplus of 2 per cent of GDP to a primary deficit of 2 per cent by 2028. That is a big secular shift in macroeconomic policy, but it remains far away and, in the meantime, France and Italy face fiscal retrenchment. The eurozone has seen a long series of false dawns over recent years. It risks happening again if the European Central Bank continues to sit on its hands as the Wicksellian \u201cnatural\u201d rate of interest plummets. Trump\u2019s tariffs on Europe will now ratchet up to 15 per cent. The trade shock amounts to 25 per cent this year when you add in euro appreciation against the dollar, or a de facto 60 per cent shock on metal products. Trump has yet to drop his full pharma bomb. He is talking of 100 per cent tariffs on semiconductors. The market narrative that the worst is over and that stability will come will surely become a collectors\u2019 item for historians and students of the capitalist psyche. Nothing is ever stable with Trump.\n\nLoading He has just inflicted the biggest trade shock in peacetime since the origins of the modern economy in the 17th Century. He has killed Pax Americana stone dead, destroyed NATO credibility, carpet-bombed the West and smashed the rules-based order to smithereens on every level. Yet asset markets remain insouciantly priced for perfection. What can possibly go wrong? Telegraph, London",

When cafe owners start talking in these kinds of terms, it\u2019s easy for your eyes to glaze over. You\u2019ve heard it before, a hundred times. You\u2019ve watched those operators come and go, a hundred times. And often not through any particular fault of their own. Breakfast and lunch venues \u2013 let\u2019s call them, broadly speaking \u2013 are hard. Tom Cooney at Landing Bakery in Scarborough. Markus Ravik But Tom Cooney\u2019s relative youth is deceptive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s walked the talk longer than most, and has a calculated instinct for what works and what doesn\u2019t. His connections and collaborations date all the way back to Cup Roastery in Woolloongabba, and then run through all sorts of other venues, from the local outpost for Coffee Supreme to Hai Hai Ramen in Paddington to Anytime Coffee in the CBD. More recently, he\u2019s best known for Riser, the picture-perfect bakery and cafe in bucolic Toowong that slays every weekend. So, what\u2019s he doing all the way out here, in Scarborough? It\u2019s to open Landing Bakery with long-time business partner (since Anytime, recently sold) Jack Wakefield. Related Article Perspective Would SEQ beach clubs be such a bad thing? \u201cJack was born here and he knows this area really well, and he said to me, \u2018We really need to do a bakery out here,\u2019 and I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know about that,\u2019\u201d Cooney says, laughing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd then he said it another 20 times over the next three months. We came out and I sat with him at this very spot, looking out at the water across the park, and I thought, \u2018We have to do it.\u2019\u201d Cooney is still working through how he describes the difference between what comes from the oven at Riser and Landing. Because it is different. Maybe the former is more rustic while the latter cleaner and more classic, he says. The Five Mile Radius and Matthew Reynolds-designed space references the area\u2019s famous red cliffs. Markus Ravik \u201cWhen we make a croissant, say, at Riser, we\u2019re trying to be more complex, deeply flavoured, and have some resistance and some chew to them. They\u2019re an experience on their own. \u201cHere, it\u2019s more classic and cloudy and as crispy as possible. That was our aim.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt makes sense. If you\u2019re visiting Riser it\u2019s often a grab-and-go situation, given its popularity; the croissants and the sandwiches and the sausage rolls and whatever else feel like a unique expression of that venue, almost so you can take a little bit of it with you. A selection of pastries at Landing Bakery. Markus Ravik Landing feels more intended to eat in, or at the most maybe take it over the road to the park and enjoy under its strip of towering Norfolk pines. That\u2019s if you\u2019re visiting, of course, but this is a venue designed very much for locals first. And as Wakefield suspected, it\u2019s well timed to appeal to the growing number of city folk who are choosing to live out here, 40 minutes from the CBD. Landing\u2019s initial selection of pastries includes almond croissants, pain au chocolat, morning buns and gochujang scrolls. Markus Ravik\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen this masthead visits Landing during a soft service the Thursday before the bakery opens proper, they\u2019re already buzzing around, filling the light and bright space designed by Five Mile Radius and Matthew Reynolds, with its handsome pale timber communal tables, and pigmented sand-cast and concrete furnishings (intended to reflect the red cliffs of the area), going large on baker Dan Smyth\u2019s almond croissants, pain au chocolat, morning buns and gochujang scrolls. Later in the day a clutch of sandwiches \u2013 a chicken salad, a Reuben (prepared with house-made pastrami), roasted vegetable and hummus, and a porchetta roll \u2013 come on-stream. Like Riser, there\u2019s a range of bread (plain or seeded sourdough, a country loaf and a focaccia) and an abbreviated selection of pantry staples on a shelf at the front door \u2013 jarred pickles, beetroot ketchup, smoked ketchup, tomato relish and bags of Fox coffee, which has also produced Landing\u2019s house coffee blend. \u201cThe idea is to bring something interesting here, when it\u2019s building and wanting these kind of things,\u201d Cooney says. \u201cYou fill a gap. It\u2019s a simple concept, really.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt can be risky but we thought, \u2018No, this is a good time.\u2019\u201d Open Wed-Sun 6.30am-2pm 71 Landsborough Avenue, Scarborough instagram.com/landingbakery\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

        "text": "Infant deaths linked to a sexually transmitted infection in Australia have prompted health authorities to sound the alarm.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief medical officer, Michael Kidd, declared syphilis a Communicable Disease Incident of National Significance (CDINS) on Thursday, adding the declaration \"will bring together national efforts to coordinate an enhanced national response\".\n\n\n\n\n\nCDNIS refers to a disease incident that necessitates the application of national policies, interventions, public communications, or the deployment of Commonwealth resources to support the affected areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am very concerned about the ongoing impact of syphilis on public health,\" Kidd said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Infectious syphilis cases have been on the rise across Australia, resulting in tragic cases of congenital syphilis and infant deaths, which might have been prevented.\"\n\n\n\nBetween 2016 and 2024, 99 cases of congenital syphilis were reported in Australia, leading to the deaths of 33 infants. More than half were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far in 2025, Australia has recorded 3,546 cases of infectious syphilis and 11 cases of congenital syphilis, which have led to the deaths of four infants.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is everything you need to know about syphilis.\n\n\n\nWhat is syphilis?\n\nSyphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can lead to serious health problems if it is not treated.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe infection usually happens in four stages:\n\n\n\nPrimary syphilis\n\nSecondary syphilis\n\nLatent syphilis\n\nTertiary syphilis\n\nOver the past 10 years, syphilis case reports in Australia have risen significantly, according to Healthdirect, Australia's virtual public health information service.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Health has reported that since reporting started in 2004, infectious syphilis notifications reached the highest levels in 2023, \"affecting people in almost all parts of Australia\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Winter warning: Meningococcal cases rising as experts urge vigilance\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nMany people with syphilis do not notice any symptoms, and the World Health Organisation (WHO) says it can also go unnoticed by healthcare providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Similar to other sexually transmissible infections, syphilis often shows no symptoms, and can go undetected and untreated,\" Kidd said.\n\n\n\nDepending on which stage of the disease the patient is experiencing, symptoms vary.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose in the primary stage can notice a painless sore or sores in or on their mouth, anus, penis, vagina, or cervix.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second stage, symptoms include a red rash on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, chest, or back, as well as fever, hair loss, headaches, and tiredness, according to Healthdirect.\n\n\n\n\n\nLatent syphilis may have no obvious symptoms, and it can stay hidden for life or develop into tertiary syphilis, when the bacteria can damage any part of the body, causing serious disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO also says babies born with the infection can experience:\n\n\n\nRashes\n\nInflammation in the organs\n\nAnaemia\n\nBone and joint problems\n\nNeurological conditions\n\nDevelopmental delays\n\nSeizures\n\nIs it deadly?\n\nIf left untreated, syphilis can lead to serious health problems, especially for pregnant people and their babies, Kidd said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to WHO, syphilis can increase the risk of HIV infection and cause severe diseases, while tertiary syphilis \"can cause death\".\n\n\n\nHow is syphilis transmitted?\n\nAs a sexually transmitted infection, syphilis can be transmitted during unprotected skin-to-skin contact during vaginal, anal or oral sex.\n\n\n\n\n\nSyphilis is highly contagious during the primary and secondary stages; however, even in the early latent phase, when no sores are present, infected individuals can still transmit the disease to others.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disease can also spread to babies during pregnancy, leading to serious health problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt could also occasionally be transmitted by blood contamination.\n\n\n\nIs there any cure for syphilis?\n\nThe good news is that the disease is curable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Syphilis is preventable, and is easy to treat if found early. Testing and treatment are simple and accessible. Congenital syphilis can be completely prevented through early detection and treatment of syphilis in pregnant people and their partners,\" Kidd said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there is no effective vaccine for syphilis, Healthdirect suggests syphilis can also be prevented by practising safe sex.\n\n\n\nWho is at more risk?\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people remain disproportionately impacted, with infectious syphilis notification rates seven times higher than those of non-Indigenous Australians overall in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Healthdirect, other population groups that are more at risk include males who have sex with males, females of childbearing age and people living in outback areas or regional and remote Australia.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is widely expected to cut the cash rate when it meets on 12 August.\n\n\n\n\n\nEconomists are predicting a drop of 0.25 percentage points from 3.85 to 3.6 per cent., following the RBA\u2019s surprise decision in July to hold rates steady despite easing inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf announced, a cut could help lift consumer sentiment amid global uncertainty, but some experts are warning that the benefits are a 'double-edged sword'.\n\n\n\nHow likely is a rate cut?\n\nEconomists say two factors are likely to influence the RBA's decision: easing inflation and growing unemployment.\n\n\n\nRising unemployment levels could be a sign that the RBA will cut interest rates on Tuesday Source: AAP / Joel Carrett The Australian Bureau of Statistic's (ABS) June quarter Consumer Price Index figures showed annual inflation easing from 2.4 to 2.1 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nJune labour figures from the ABS also show unemployment has risen to its highest level since November 2021 at 4.2 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you put rising unemployment, overlay that with disinflationary trends, and then you look at the GDP report which painted a really tepid picture of growth for the Australian economy , it really does warrant further interest rate cuts,\" IG market analyst Tony Sycamore said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Sally Tindall from financial comparison site Canstar says that while a cut is \"highly likely\", it\u2019s important to remember that \"nothing is guaranteed until the RBA actually does make that decision at 2.30pm on Tuesday\".\n\n\n\nWho benefits from an interest rate cut?\n\nTindall said mortgage holders can expect to see the biggest benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The winners are mortgage customers, particularly those who use the market to their advantage by going and haggling with their bank or refinancing,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople thinking of buying a home may also have more borrowing power. Households that earn $150,000 before tax may be able to access more than $17,000 extra.\n\n\n\n\n\nTindall urged caution because rate cuts can sometimes be a \"double-edged sword\" as it can lead to an increase in house prices.\n\n\n\nWhy could an interest rate cut mean higher house prices?\n\nMore buyers on the market squeezes an already short supply of houses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It brings buyers to the market, buyers have deeper pockets and they can spend more on a home,\" Domain\u2019s Nicola Powell says.\n\n\n\n\n\nA report from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) found the RBA\u2019s February reduction in the cash rate saw housing prices increase by 3.1 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt forecasts that RBA rate cuts in August and November would lead to house prices rising by 6 per cent in 2025 and 4 per cent in 2026.\n\n\n\nWhere will housing prices be affected?\n\nCapital cities tend to see bigger shifts, with Sydney and Melbourne more sensitive to interest rates changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CBA also forecasts that an interest rate cut could lead to house price increases of 8 per cent in Brisbane, 7 per cent in Perth and 6 per cent in Adelaide.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News\n\n\n\nBut Canstar\u2019s Tindall says this is not a reason why the RBA shouldn\u2019t reduce the cash rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What will help cool the situation is increased stock, and I think that still needs further intervention from the government,\" she said.\n\n\n\nWhat about people who don't own a home?\n\nTindall says renters may also be hit with higher costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Rents are rising at four-and-a-half per cent every year, which is a difficult hurdle for many households to clear, and unfortunately it's still going to be tough times ahead for renters.\"\n\n\n\nAn RBA interest rate cut could make renting less affordable Source: AAP / Lukas Coch Sycamore from IG Markets says a common knock-on effect of higher house prices is that landlords may be encouraged to put up rent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And that\u2019s not really something we need at this point in time.\"\n\n\n\nSo is an interest rate cut a good or a bad thing?\n\nSycamore says an interest rate cut would be a symbol of growing optimism in the Australian market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is real benefit in terms of just lifting the gloom which has really been lingering over the Australian economy since COVID, because that's when the cost of living crisis really came to the forefront,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTindall says it is a good time to re-examine your finances to make sure you\u2019re getting the best deal for your circumstances, especially since interest rate cuts are not always passed on by banks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat ultimately matters is the rate you\u2019re currently on.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Some people are also looking for natural alternatives, and they say skin irritation they have experienced from certain products has caused them to shift from conventional products. As a result, alternatives like homemade creams and mineral-based sunscreens have become more popular. Some people are also choosing to stop using sunscreen entirely. \u201cI am definitely a MAHA mom and voted for Trump so that RFK Jr could get into office,\u201d says Summer Whiteside, 31, an ER nurse from Wildomar, California, in a text message. \u201cAfter listening to his podcast on Joe Rogan, I knew he was the man for the job.\u201d On Instagram, Whiteside \u2013 who doesn\u2019t shy away from the label \u201ccrunchy\u201d \u2013 posts about things like beef tallow for sunburns and her preference for mineral sunscreen. Whiteside, who says she has concerns about the chemicals in sunscreen, uses long-sleeved rash guards on her kids and sunblock only on their faces. Some wellness figures have claimed that diet changes or building sun exposure gradually can protect against burns, which dermatologists and the scientific community strongly recommend against. Some in the anti-sunscreen movement point to studies suggesting that certain chemicals cause cancer or are absorbed too heavily into the body. But public health experts say there are no human studies that conclusively prove ingredients like oxybenzone act as carcinogens.\n\n\u201cOxybenzone has been used since the 1970s in sunscreen, so we would have found out by now if it caused harm,\u201d says Henry W Lim, senior vice president of academic affairs and former chair of dermatology at Henry Ford Health. Lim says that some groups will use testing methods and safety thresholds in studies that differ from those required for product approval in the United States. \u201cA lot of the concerns come from animal studies using high doses, but those results don\u2019t automatically translate to humans,\u201d says Lim, who is also the president of the International League of Dermatological Societies and a past president of the American Academy of Dermatology. Dermatologists say sunscreen is important for protecting skin from melanoma, at any age. Credit: Getty Images What do health experts and science say?\n\nHealth professionals warn that anti-sunscreen messaging can be harmful for the public because skin cancer remains one of the most common types of cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. Experts say sunscreen is one of the most effective tools for prevention. Adam Friedman, a professor and chair of dermatology at George Washington University, says scepticism of sunscreen is nothing new. Concerns about chemical ingredients and mistrust in federal oversight resurface every few years, often fuelled by social media and wellness trends. But he says the science has remained consistent. \u201cUltraviolet radiation is a known carcinogen; there is no debate about that,\u201d Friedman says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had decades of data showing that sunscreen plays a critical role in reducing skin cancer risk.\u201d Loading Studies have shown that regular sunscreen use significantly reduces the risk of skin cancer. A randomised controlled trial in Australia, known as the Nambour Skin Cancer Prevention Trial, followed more than 1,600 participants for about 10 years. Those who used sunscreen daily had a lower incidence of melanoma compared with those who used it occasionally.\n\nAnother prospective cohort study of more than 143,000 Norwegian women found that using an SPF 15 or higher sunscreen was associated with a 33 per cent lower risk of melanoma, compared with people using less than an SPF 15 or none at all. The American Academy of Dermatology recommends broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher daily, even on cloudy days. Mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are considered safe by dermatologists. Veena Vanchinathan, a board-certified dermatologist in California and a member of the American Academy of Dermatology, says the hesitation regarding sunscreen use in wellness spaces is not supported by current scientific evidence. She explained that just because a sunscreen ingredient is absorbed into the body doesn\u2019t mean it is harmful. \u201cWe see small amounts of absorption from many everyday products without any proven risk,\u201d Vanchinathan says. \u201cOur skin is designed to function as a barrier, not a sponge.\u201d Her bigger concern is that people are skipping sunscreen altogether or using ineffective unproven alternatives like coconut oil or beef tallow. This could lead to more preventable sun damage, especially among younger people who are influenced by wellness content online.\n\nIn the US, the Food and Drug Administration regulates sunscreen, but standards have not kept up. The last major sunscreen monograph proposal came in 1999. This document serves as the FDA\u2019s official guideline for which ingredients can be used in over-the-counter sunscreens. Although the agency has proposed updates in recent years, delays have left many newer active ingredients \u2013 which are already used in Europe and Asia \u2013 unavailable in the U.S. This regulatory delay has drawn criticism from dermatologists and public health experts who say the U.S. is falling behind global standards and giving consumers fewer safe options. Some people, frustrated by the lack of innovation, are turning to imported products or homemade solutions, which Friedman strongly discourages. \u201cWould you make Tylenol or Advil in your bathtub?\u201d Friedman said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way to replicate the safety, testing and effectiveness of a professionally formulated sunscreen.\u201d Other countries often approve sunscreen filters faster by following a different regulatory model that emphasises post-market surveillance and international data. The European Commission evaluates sunscreen ingredients under a cosmetics framework that allows newer filters to reach the market more quickly.",

Credit: AFL Photos Geelong What we say: As we have said for weeks, the Cats have the softest run home, and they are cashing in \u2013 even resting skipper Patrick Dangerfield. The Magpies\u2019 woes have allowed them to jump into second spot (on percentage), and the double chance is surely now within keeping. The Swans loomed as their only challenge in the final month, so Sunday\u2019s clash will be a good hitout for Chris Scott and his men. Best case: First. Worst case: Fourth. Refreshed: Patrick Dangerfield was afforded a rest against Essendon. Credit: Getty Images\n\nCollingwood What we say: This has been some fall from grace for a team that last month was 10 points clear on top of the ladder. The Magpies have since dropped four of their past five games, and appear a shell of the fluent, ball-moving side we had become accustomed to. The Magpies looked old and slow against the Hawks, and appeared too heavily reliant on Nick Daicos for creativity. The absence again of a concussed Jeremy Howe weakens a fragile defence. Now come the rampaging Crows. Surely, the Magpies will at least beat the Demons in round 24 \u2026 or so we think. Best case: First. Worst case: Sixth. Main man: The Magpies appear overly reliant on Nick Daicos for their ball movement. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Fremantle\n\nWhat we say: While the Crows have won the plaudits, the Dockers are just as hot. They have won five on the bounce, and 11 of their past 12 games, their only loss by 11 points to Sydney. They are playing a more attacking game, and the results are showing. Now comes arguably the toughest fortnight of the prospective finalists. Win both and a top-two berth could be within reach. We\u2019ll back them in against the Lions, but reserve our thoughts when it comes to the Western Bulldogs. Best case: First. Worst case: Sixth. On a tear: Andrew Brayshaw and the Dockers are in fine form. Credit: Getty Images Brisbane Lions\n\nWhat we say: The Lions aren\u2019t the dominant force many thought they would be, and may have now let slip the double chance \u2013 and a true shot at their premiership defence. Wow. The loss of Lachie Neale for the remainder of the home-and-away season has hurt. The Swans troubled the Lions by going by hand as often as possible from defence on Saturday \u2013 a tactic others, surely, will follow. That\u2019s two losses in three weeks, with the Dockers to come in Perth. Lose that, and the double chance could be all but a memory. Huge week ahead. Best case: Third. Worst case: Eighth. Hobbled: Lachie Neale won\u2019t play again until the finals. Credit: via Getty Images Gold Coast What we say: It\u2019s always felt a touch odd to believe the Suns could earn the double chance, because we know their finals history \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 all too well. But with an extra game up their sleeve (the rescheduled clash against Essendon), the double chance is within reach. They should take care of the Giants this week, while the Power, at home, are still a major challenge. We\u2019ll back the Suns in to win both, leaving the Bombers clash to ultimately determine their fate. Best case: Second. Worst case: Ninth.\n\nWithin reach: Ben King and the Gold Coast Suns are on the cusp of a maiden finals run. Credit: AFL Photos Hawthorn What we say: Hokball is back, and the Hawks deserve praise. We were worried about their finals hopes, even last month tipping they would miss the top eight. But a strong performance on the road against the Crows, and a crushing win over Collingwood (we changed our projection last week and tipped the Hawks), have them all but certain finalists. They should take care of business against the Demons, leaving the trip north on the final Sunday of the home-and-away season to determine their top-four hopes. Best case: Fourth. Worst case: Ninth. Reading the room: Jack Ginnivan knows how to play the pantomime villain in Adelaide. Credit: Fox Footy\n\nGWS What we say: This is a tough one. After their shocker against the Bulldogs, our top-eight projections had the Giants missing September on percentage. That was dependent on them losing to the Suns next weekend. However, if they can flip that script and win, and then take care of the Saints, they should be in. A top-four finish, though, appears a step too far. Best case: Fifth. Worst case: Ninth. Hanging on: The Giants are clinging to a finals berth. Credit: via Getty Images Western Bulldogs\n\nWhat we say: The Dogs got out of jail against the Demons to remain in the finals hunt. Had they lost, their season would have been all but over. However, Hawthorn\u2019s win over the Magpies hasn\u2019t helped the Dogs\u2019 cause, because they are running out of teams they can replace in the top eight. They will knock over the Eagles next Sunday. Then comes a season-defining clash against the Dockers. Best case: Sixth. Worst case: Ninth. On the edge: Marcus Bontempelli and his Bulldogs may miss the finals. Credit: Getty Images How we think it will play out",

Priorities: Vegemite toast first, then I unpack as best I can, take a wander through the garden on our farm in regional Victoria, then pop a few fresh flowers around the house \u2014 vitamin D and walking is a great cure for jet lag. If all is going well, I\u2019ll bake for my family. Joy for me is definitely found in the little things. Embrace life\u2019s simple pleasures Like many parents, our lives are consumed by weekend sport. My husband James and I are human taxis, but we wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore all that begins, I love to start my Saturday with a cuppa (or two, so I can read the papers) in bed. I open up the blinds and enjoy the constantly changing view across the garden and out towards the trees. Once I\u2019ve downed my second cup, I hit the local markets to load up on groceries for the weekend, then it\u2019s time to get behind the wheel of my \u201ctaxi\u201d. Food and movement inform everything we do at home, and they help lay the foundations for a fulfilling Saturday. We\u2019re pretty active! I love to ride my bike around the farm and walk through the paddocks to check on the lambs now being born. When I first moved to the farm, I immediately asked my husband for a chook house, so weekends always involve a walk to gather those freshly laid eggs. Being with my loved ones is everything to me, so Saturdays are all about connection. I\u2019ll make sure guests have their favourite treats, I go all out on a comfy guest room, make sure there are flowers by the bed and bake up a storm (triple-chocolate brownies are a crowd favourite). I\u2019m not hugely social, but I treasure my small group of loved ones. Protect your peace I try to limit my time on the phone, especially on a Saturday. It affects your mood and I love to chat to people directly. My goal is to create a warm, beautiful home where people can relax. That means no phones at the table and, as a feng shui fan, we have no technology in the bedroom.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinding balance is my goal. My work can be bonkers and high octane, so for me to maximise that I have to be healthy. I try to rest, take my vitamins, head out into nature, deep dive into a good book and get my hands dirty in the garden. My weekends allow me to catch up and recalibrate. Go with the flow Feeding her loved ones also feeds her soul. A Saturday night for me is never straightforward. I could be hosting an event, cheering on my sporting team, at home in front of the fire (watching Getaway, of course) or cooking for loved ones. I\u2019m a Cancerian, so I always love sharing my home and feeding the troops.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m pretty easy-going, which seems to bode well for life as a traveller. I\u2019ve learned first-hand to suck the marrow out of life. None of us know what each day has in store, so I try to remain open-minded and go with the flow. The perfect Saturday doesn\u2019t need to be extravagant; my husband and I enjoy instant coffee, I love finding pretty flowers by the roadside (I keep secateurs in the glove box just in case), and packet cakes are always appreciated. It\u2019s the little things and rituals that help centre me and allow for a calm start to the week. 5 Star Saturdays are made with Saturday Lotto. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice?

        "text": "Mary Daly, the San Francisco Fed chief, hinted strongly on Wednesday that there could be three cuts this northern autumn. \u201cWe know that once the labour market stumbles, it tends to fall quickly and hard,\u201d she said. For now, it is a story of \u201clow hiring\u201d. It becomes dangerous if companies start firing as well. That can turn into a self-feeding downward spiral of mass layoffs that slips control, forcing the Fed to slash rates to the bone. US jobs growth ground to a screeching halt in May and June, just as labour economists had predicted. Credit: Bloomberg The US property market is already crying out for relief. Mortgage applications have collapsed to the levels of the mid-1990s. The Freddie Mac house price index has fallen for the past five months in a row. Property owners in south-west Florida are slashing prices at the fastest rate since the subprime bust in 2007-08. Wall Street has shrugged off the slowdown, but that is because traders are betting on the \u201cFed put\u201d \u2013 Vickie Chang, from Goldman Sachs, says markets have priced in both a \u201cnegative US growth shock\u201d and a \u201cdoveish policy shock\u201d at the same time.\n\nThe two more or less offset each other. In other words, the Fed will ensure that the Schiller price-to-earnings ratio on Wall Street remains near the peak of the dotcom bubble at over 38, and junk bond spreads remain as compressed as they were at the peak of the Lehman credit bubble. Uncle Jerome will keep investors fat and happy. Loading The Fed will undoubtedly cut rates, but it is an invidious position. The next shocker may well be the core inflation figures out next week. The delayed effects of the tariffs are about to feed through with malicious and unstoppable force. Welcome to 1970s Nixonian stagflation. Donald Trump will doubtless declare that the index has been manipulated by Marxist fifth columnists. Good luck with that. The US is unable to substitute 90 per cent of its current imports with local production. Trump\u2019s trade taxes will be paid by US consumers via higher prices, and by US companies with plants abroad or reliance on foreign inputs via lower profit margins. Caterpillar has already warned that the Trump levy will cost it up to $US1.5 billion ($2.3 billion) a year. Brewer Molson Coors expects earnings to fall by 7 to 10 per cent because Trump\u2019s 50 per cent tariffs on aluminium have pushed metal can costs through the roof.\n\nWe know from early warning signals \u2013 both the ISM\u2019s service price paid index and S&P Global\u2019s composite PMI output prices \u2013 that price impulse is filtering through with the usual multi-month lag, and that headline inflation will approach an annualised rate near 5 per cent over the next three months. Durable goods prices are already rising at the fastest rate since the early 1990s. The Yale Budget Lab expects food and apparel prices to rise by almost 40 per cent. The Fed will undoubtedly cut rates, but it is an invidious position. Britain and Europe are in a different position. They are absorbing the brunt of China\u2019s galactic overcapacity, and absorbing some of its deflation too as a wave of cheap Chinese exports are diverted from the US and into their markets. They are not committing further economic self-harm by raising inflationary trade taxes themselves. I can understand the reasons for the hawkish tone of the Bank of England\u2019s rate cut on Thursday, but lingering worries of UK inflation may soon be washed away by larger global forces. \u201cThe Bank will be compelled to cut faster in 2026,\u201d said Mathieu Savary, of BCA Research, who thinks that deflation is the greater danger stalking Europe.\n\nThe eurozone\u2019s rebound has stalled. The growth spurt earlier this year was an illusion of \u201ctariff front-running\u201d. German industrial output fell 1.9 per cent in June. It is down 4 per cent from a year ago, and 10 per cent below its pre-pandemic level. \u201cIt\u2019s a cold shower for our long-held view of a cyclical rebound in German industry,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, of ING. Brzeski said Germany\u2019s Mittelstand family firms cannot blunt the impact of the tariffs by relocating production to the US. These firms have always formed the backbone of the Wirtschaftswunder (or economic miracle). They are being hammered on a second front by China, which has moved up the technology ladder and is now competing toe to toe in third markets, with the help of a suppressed exchange rate.\n\nKeynesian rearmament and a blitz of infrastructure spending will eventually lift Germany out of the doldrums. The Merz government is swinging from a primary budget surplus of 2 per cent of GDP to a primary deficit of 2 per cent by 2028. That is a big secular shift in macroeconomic policy, but it remains far away and, in the meantime, France and Italy face fiscal retrenchment. The eurozone has seen a long series of false dawns over recent years. It risks happening again if the European Central Bank continues to sit on its hands as the Wicksellian \u201cnatural\u201d rate of interest plummets. Trump\u2019s tariffs on Europe will now ratchet up to 15 per cent. The trade shock amounts to 25 per cent this year when you add in euro appreciation against the dollar, or a de facto 60 per cent shock on metal products. Trump has yet to drop his full pharma bomb. He is talking of 100 per cent tariffs on semiconductors. The market narrative that the worst is over and that stability will come will surely become a collectors\u2019 item for historians and students of the capitalist psyche. Nothing is ever stable with Trump.\n\nLoading He has just inflicted the biggest trade shock in peacetime since the origins of the modern economy in the 17th Century. He has killed Pax Americana stone dead, destroyed NATO credibility, carpet-bombed the West and smashed the rules-based order to smithereens on every level. Yet asset markets remain insouciantly priced for perfection. What can possibly go wrong? Telegraph, London",

Picture: ABC\n\nThe board was smashed to pieces but amazingly, Bowie only escaped with a scratch and a puncture to his wetsuit. Picture: ABC\n\nWhile Bowie escaped virtually unscathed \u2013 suffering only a scratch and puncture to his wetsuit \u2013 the shark destroyed his beloved surfboard.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHis father Simon explained to the ABC his son could have \u201clost his whole leg\u201d if he was on the board properly.\n\n\u201cWe got really lucky,\u201d he said.\n\nMr Daly said it was his \u201cworst nightmare\u201d realising his son had been attacked, before paddling out with another group of surfers to help his son.\n\n\u201cThose seconds and that 20m of paddling was definitely the most intense of my life,\u201d he said.\n\nA NSW Ambulance spokesman confirmed paramedics had been called over the incident but reported no injuries.\n\nThe attack occurred at Tathra Beach on the NSW south coast. Picture: Supplied / Google Maps\n\nAccording to the Australian Shark-Incident Database (ASID), there has been an average of 20 incidents in which people have been injured by sharks.\n\nOn average, there were 2.8 fatalities each year and seven incidents in which the person was uninjured.\n\nThree fatal shark attacks have been recorded so far in 2025 \u2013 one each in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn January, 28-year-old Lance Appleby disappeared while surfing off Granites Beach, south of Streaky Bay in SA, after being attacked by a shark.\n\nThe shark caused damage to Bowie\u2019s wetsuit.

His body also could not be recovered.\n\nRising ocean temperatures due to climate change, in addition to a greater number of people swimming in the ocean, have been attributed to the steadily-rising number of attacks over the last 10 years.\n\nBowie\u2019s father Simon Daly said the pair \u2018got really lucky\u2019. Picture: ABC\n\nBond University Associate Professor and shark researcher Dr Daryl McPhee said rising water temperatures rise along the coast, specifically around the Greater Sydney region, meant bull sharks were expanding their search for food \u2013 moving further south of Sydney and down the coast.\n\nShe said an increase in prey in the area \u2013 such as humpback whales \u2013 had driven the increase of shark sightings and attacks.",

Picture: Martin Ollman / NewsWire\n\nCoalition maverick Barnaby Joyce has welcomed chatter of a road tax for electric vehicle owners, saying that EV drivers are freeloading off fuel levies paid by other road users.\n\nState and federal officials are meeting with motor industry leaders at a summit in Sydney on Monday, where they will discuss a tax as part of brainstorming to fund future roads.\n\nSenior minister Tanya Plibersek played down the talks when appearing on a morning show, saying it was \u201ca discussion that the states and territories have been leading for some time\u201d.\n\nThe Albanese government is mulling a road user charge for electric vehicles. Picture: Martin Ollman / NewsWire\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that as the number of petrol vehicles and diesel vehicles goes down, the take from fuel excise decreases,\u201d the former environment minister told Seven\u2019s Sunrise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThat means less money for building and maintaining roads.\u201d\n\nShe added \u201cthe Treasurer will be interested in the discussion today\u201d but also noted that Anthony Albanese \u201chas made clear that our tax priorities are delivering on the tax cut for every Australian that we\u2019ve promised and making sure that multinational companies pay their fair share\u201d.\n\nMs Plibersek also said: \u201cI don\u2019t think anything\u2019s happening tomorrow\u201d.\n\nAppearing opposite her was Mr Joyce, who put a different spin on Ms Plibersek\u2019s support for \u201csensible\u201d canvassing of road-funding options.\n\nA hardcore opponent of the Albanese government\u2019s green transition, he said it was about time.\n\nNationals heavyweight Barnaby Joyce has welcomed chatter of a road user charge for electric vehicles. Picture: Martin Ollman / NewsWire\n\n\u201cI have a sense there\u2019s a lot of EVs in Tanya\u2019s electorate, so she doesn\u2019t want to jump right in there,\u201d Mr Joyce said.\n\n\u201cBut we out here are overwhelming combustion engines because, as you can see, it is different terrain.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cI feel we are paying the excise that a lot of people are getting away with.\u201d\n\nHe also claimed there are no electric utes used in the country after Ms Plibersek said there were.\n\n\u201cNot out here, there isn\u2019t. I assure you, not out here. Haven\u2019t seen one,\u201d Mr Joyce shot back.\n\nThere is precedent for an EV charge.\n\nNew Zealand last week captured EVs in plans for a blanket road usage duty for light vehicles.\n\nThe duty would be based on distance travelled and vehicle weight rather than a tax at the bowser.",
