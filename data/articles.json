(AAP Image: Dave Hunt)\n\nIn Western Australia, 830 children and young people receive support on any given day \u2014 a 17 per cent increase from the year before.\n\nWA also has the highest number of people turned away from homelessness services in the country, with an average of 96 requests for assistance unable to be met on a daily basis.\n\nHomeless battle poor sleep, bad diets and stress Western Australian research is showing a strong link between homelessness and poor health, with life expectancy more than 30 years lower for people without secure housing.\n\nFor Caitlan, who has just finished her final year of high school and is a member of WA's Youth Homelessness Advisory Council, knowing there are hundreds of children and young people experiencing homelessness and trying to keep up with school is devastating.\n\n\"I experienced homelessness in Melbourne for four years, three of which I did not attend school,\" she said.\n\n\"I was very lucky that I was able to get support and stable housing [with family in WA].\n\n\"There are still so many young people out there experiencing what I had to experience \u2026 and there isn't that support accessible to them.\n\n\"Seeing the numbers and seeing the reality of the crisis here in WA is not shocking because I know that there are gaps in the system that need to be fixed.\"\n\nCoalition calls for action\n\nA coalition of peak bodies, frontline services and young people is hoping to persuade the WA government to prioritise ending youth homelessness, calling for $150 million to be spent on the issue in the upcoming WA state budget.\n\nYouth Affairs Council of WA CEO Kylie Wallace is calling for more action to address youth homelessness. (ABC News: Briana Shepherd )\n\n\"We shouldn't have a huge hidden population of hundreds of school students experiencing rough sleeping and homelessness in the wealthiest state in Australia,\" Youth Affairs Council of WA CEO Kylie Wallace said.\n\n\"For every crisis bed that becomes available each night [in Perth], 69 children and young people are competing for that one bed.\n\n\"Housing stability is foundational to education, wellbeing and future opportunity.\n\n\"[We're] calling on the state government to acknowledge this is a crisis and respond via a targeted investment in the upcoming state budget.\"\n\nKylie Wallace and Caitlin want the government to prioritise ending youth homelessness. (ABC News: Briana Shepherd )\n\nWhile Ms Wallace acknowledged the state government had boosted funding towards homelessness services, including a record investment into new social housing, she said there had been little investment directly targeted towards children and young people.\n\n\"We shouldn't have a huge hidden population of hundreds of school students experiencing rough sleeping and homelessness in the wealthiest state in Australia,\" she said.\n\n\"Commitments made in the next state budget could solve it.\"\n\nGovernment backs strategy\n\nWA's Minister for Homelessness Matthew Swinbourn said the state government had supported homelessness services like no other government had.\n\n\"We don't accept young people not being able to get a home or to be facing homelessness,\" he said.\n\n\"We're in the middle of the 10-year homelessness strategy and very soon I'll be releasing the next five-year action plan inside of that.\n\nMatthew Swinbourn says the state government is committed to supporting homelessness services. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\n\"What we find when young people experience homelessness, if we are able to get the supports around them, then typically they don't necessarily experience homelessness in later life.\"\n\nThat was a sentiment the government and those working in the sector agreed on.\n\n\"If we don't do this, WA's youth homelessness crisis will deepen,\" Ms Wallace said.",

(Supplied: Channel 9)\n\n\"I tried to go somewhere where they wouldn't broadcast it, but obviously they did,\" she said.\n\n\"Maybe some conversations can be had because I feel like at this tournament, the only private place we have is the locker room.\"\n\nOther players came out in support of Gauff's sentiments, including Iga \u015awi\u0105tek.\n\n\"The question is, are we tennis players or are we animals in the zoo, where they are observed even when they poop?\" Swiatek said.\n\n\"It's not our job [to] be a meme when you forget your accreditation. Oh, it's funny, for sure. People have something to talk about, but for us I don't think it's necessary.\"\n\nNovak Djokovic added to the debate, saying, \"I'm surprised that we have no cameras while we are taking a shower. That's probably the next step.\"\n\n'Old man' wants a cut of ticket sales\n\nWhile we're talking about Djokovic, remember what he said after his insane five-set win over defending champion Jannik Sinner in the semifinal?\n\n\"I'm an old man, I need to go earlier to sleep,\" he said after the semifinal ended way past his self-prescribed bedtime.\n\nDjokovic also made a cheeky joke that he wanted \"10 per cent of tonight's tickets sold\" because of the entertaining match he and Sinner put on. We're not sure that's how it works, though.\n\nNovak Djokovic played in his 11th Australian Open title. (Getty Images: Darrian Traynor)\n\nAfter the other semifinal between Alexander Zverev and Carlos Alcaraz, the German said he wasn't a fan of how the Spaniard utilised murky medical timeout rules.\n\n\"I didn't like it, but it's not my decision. I just said it was bulls***, basically,\" he said.\n\nAlcaraz was allowed a medical timeout late in the third set of the intense match for what he said was an adductor issue, but what many believe looked more like cramp.\n\nHe said the injury was very painful but it wasn't going to force him to retire because he \"hates giving up\".\n\n\"I always say you have to believe in yourself no matter what,\" Alcaraz said. That's a nice motivational quote!\n\nLegends say thanks\n\nStan Wawrinka has long been a favourite here at Melbourne Park, probably even before his breakthrough grand slam title at the 2014 Australian Open.\n\nBut he bid farewell to the slam after losing to ninth seed Taylor Fritz in the third round.\n\nWawrinka fought back tears as he sat on his bench after the match, before joining tournament director Craig Tiley on the court to thank an adoring crowd and sign off his Open career in the most Australian way possible.\n\n\"First of all, thank you to Craig for the wildcard invitation, not the first time,\" he said.\n\n\"For me it was a lot of emotion when you called me to give me this opportunity for one last chance to say goodbye to the people here in Melbourne.\n\n\"I'm sad to leave, but it's been an amazing journey.\"\n\nTo sign off for good, he grabbed two beers from his bag, gave one to Tiley and cracked the other himself.\n\n\"Cheers everybody, and thank you so much.\"\n\nThe 2026 Open even marked a goodbye for Frenchman Gael Monfils, who lost in the first round to Aussie Dane Sweeny.\n\n\"For me, my journey here with you guys started in 2003, when I came here for the first time,\" Monfils said.\n\n\"Now we are in 2026 and somehow it is the finish line but thank you so much for this amazing ride.\"\n\nMonfils has played his last Australian Open. (Getty: Morgan Hancock)\n\nDe Minaur's wedding confession\n\nThe trouble with being part of a tennis power couple is keeping the personal and professional separate, as Alex de Minaur found out after his win over America's Frances Tiafoe during the third round.\n\nA relieved de Minaur spoke to Jim Courier on court post-match, and after taking a few questions about his win and his opponent, talk soon turned to planning for his wedding to English tennis player Katie Boulter, which will take place this year.\n\n\"This is a 50-50 relationship, so honestly the fact that we're both tennis players [means] we are both doing as much as we can together,\" he said.\n\n\"And yeah, I've been involved so far with some of the decisions.\n\n\" I'm sure when it comes to like, the details of napkins and flowers and, you know, decoration purposes, that's not my forte. I'll leave that to Katie. \"\n\nCue a puzzled face from Boulter in the crowd \u2026\n\nOsaka feels like a Barbie\n\n\"I almost feel like I'm a Barbie that dresses up and goes on the court and does something,\" Naomi Osaka said following her fashion statement at the tournament.\n\nAhead of facing Antonia Ru\u017ei\u0107 in the first round, Osaka wore a white hat and veil, matched by flowing pants and an umbrella in the same colour.\n\n\"It's modelled after a jellyfish. I am so grateful to be able to get to do the things I love,\" she said.\n\n\"It's really beautiful.\"\n\nNaomi Osaka got the crowd talking with her outfit. (Getty Images: Quinn Rooney)\n\nHonourable mentions\n\nThe best of the rest starts with the statistical best men's player of all time reminding people of just that.\n\nAfter his quarterfinal win, Djokovic said he found it \"disrespectful\" that he was asked if he felt like he has always been the chaser, chasing Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"There's probably about a 15-year period in between where I was dominating the grand slams,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't feel like I'm chasing, to be honest.\"\n\nCanada's Felix Auger-Aliassime said he was sick of feeling \"like a punching bag\" in reference to his recent torrid injury record.\n\nAustralia's Taylah Preston said she felt it wouldn't be long until we had a local winner at the Open.\n\n\"I think there's a lot of us that are really pushing and getting super close at having really good results at these tournaments,\" she said.\n\nThanasi Kokkinakis admitted after he and Nick Kyrgios lost their men's doubles first-round match that the crowd \"saw probably a couple of shadows of our former selves\".\n\nKyrgios made an error when he said he and Kokkinakis were playing for \"millions of dollars\". (AAP: Joel Carrett)\n\nKyrgios was more focused on a controversial decision in that match, though.\n\n\"It doesn't make any f***ing sense. I'm pissed off,\" he said.\n\n\"We're playing for millions of dollars, we've been both injured, both trying to get to this stage, and then some of these rules are just so, so, so dumb.\"\n\nThe men's doubles prize money is in fact $900,000, not quite millions, but we take your point, Nick.",

        "text": "The market thinks the likelihood of the RBA lifting interest rates tomorrow is 72 per cent.\n\nBut here's a very important caveat \u2014 the market has been wrong before and at some point it will be wrong again.\n\nYou don't even have to look very far back to find a glaring example.\n\nIn July last year, the market was 96 per cent confident the RBA was about to cut rates. It was wrong.\n\nIndependent economist Nicki Hutley says the market's predictions are normally pretty good but forecasting is harder when the data on inflation is less clear.\n\n\"I think the market has overreacted to the December inflation data,\" she said. \"There is something that we need to be watching closely but it feels like it's a bit of a 'henny penny, the sky is falling' over-reaction to me.\"\n\nWhat do economists predict?\n\nWe consulted five leading economists. Here's what they think in a nutshell:\n\nNicki Hutley: Rate rise\n\nRichard Holden: Rate rise\n\nCassandra Winzar: Rate rise\n\nBesa Deda: Rate rise\n\nRobert Brooks: On the fence\n\nMs Hutley says the central bank will be feeling cautious about data showing inflation has ticked up.\n\n\"Their language has been quite hawkish in more recent months, and I think they'll feel that a precautionary tiny tweak is worthwhile,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't necessarily think it's the start of a longer cycle of tightening though.\"\n\nMonash University economist Robert Brooks is less definitive.\n\n\"There is sort of a post-pandemic concern that perhaps central banks waited a bit too long to move rates up and therefore let a bit more inflation get into the system,\" he said.\n\n\"But there is a question around timing and that timing has got a balance. So at one level, if rates increased, I don't think that would be a surprise.\n\n\"If rates stayed on hold, that wouldn't be a surprise either. I think you could make that case.\"\n\nBut Cassandra Winzar, chief economist at the Committee for Economic Development of Australia, says the argument for an increase is stronger than the case for keeping rates steady.\n\n\"[The RBA has] had quite a few months now of inflation being that bit higher than we'd like. So it's not just a one-off,\" she said.\n\n\"There's a fairly strong case that now is the time to take a bit more action and get inflation under control sooner rather than later.\"\n\nWhy would the RBA increase interest rates?\n\nMs Hutley says the case for a rate rise is due to inflation creeping above the Reserve Bank of Australia's target, which is between 2 per cent and 3 per cent.\n\n\"It's not out of hand, but it's certainly not heading in the right direction at the moment,\" she said. \"They are very concerned to make sure that inflation is heading back towards the centre of the target band, not away from it.\"\n\nUniversity of New South Wales economist Richard Holden says an increase in \"trimmed mean\" inflation will be of particular concern.\n\nIt rose in December to 3.3 per cent from 3.2 per cent in November.\n\n\"[That] is a sort of measure of underlying inflation to which the RBA pays attention, it has ticked up,\" he said. \"That's the most compelling argument [for a rate rise].\"\n\nMs Winzar says the fact that unemployment has remained low at 4.1 per cent will also give the RBA confidence to raise the cash rate.\n\n\"That gives the RBA little bit more leeway to raise interest rates to try and bring inflation back down into the [target] range without having too much of an effect on labour markets,\" she said.\n\nWhy would the RBA keep interest rates on hold?\n\nProfessor Brooks says low unemployment and moderate wage growth mean it would be safe for the RBA to keep rates where they are.\n\nHe says the RBA has in the past been concerned that high inflation could feed wage increases, which would then see a rise in prices.\n\n\"So that concern of a wage price interaction hasn't manifested itself,\" he said.\n\n\"The second reason why I think you could make a case potentially for rates staying on hold is that even in the face of recent data, inflation expectations have remained stable.\"\n\nBesa Deda, chief economist at William Buck, says the RBA will also be looking at the resilience of the global economy over the year, despite increasing uncertainty.\n\nShe says those risks have seen a sell-off of the US dollar, and a rise in the value of the Australian dollar.\n\n\"[It is] higher including in trade-weighted terms, which is the value of our currency against the currencies of the countries that we trade with the most,\" she said.\n\n\"That will help tradables inflation be restrained.\"\n\nProfessor Holden is less convinced, saying there are not many compelling arguments to hold rates.\n\nBut he says there is a chance the RBA may want to see more data before making the call to raise.\n\n\"You don't just sort of put rates up and down like yo-yos,\" he said.\n\n\"That would be the best argument I think one could muster, which is, maybe it's an anomaly, wait and see.\n\n\"But I don't think it's a very persuasive argument.\"\n\nHow high are interest rates anyway?\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia's official cash rate is 3.6 per cent.\n\nBanks use the cash rate to set their interest rates \u2014 new home loan borrowers will currently pay about 5.5 per cent.\n\nWhat should I read next?",

After Duda Sampaio had a drive tipped over the bar 40-year-old veteran Gabi Zanotti headed in from the resultant corner, skimming in off an unfortunate Catley.\n\nAs Arsenal pressed, Lele made a string of saves but was finally beaten by Lotte Wubben-Moy's 59th-minute header.\n\nFoord thought she had settled the final with a goal-bound 75th-minute shot, but a defender's desperate lunge turned it against the bar.\n\nInstead, Vic Albuquerque scored a last-gasp penalty awarded on a VAR review to force extra time.\n\nBut Foord would not be denied her moment. Late in the first period of extra time, Frida Maanum stole midfield possession and Arsenal broke. Foord stayed onside, received the Norwegian's pass, and drove her shot inside Lele's near post.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

In 2016, the world governing body retrospectively designated the winners as world champions.\n\nThe new competition features the six continental champions and will run annually, except in years involving the quadrennial 16-club Women's Club World Cup, which is due to launch in 2028.\n\nAustralian champions Melbourne City, who were a penalty shoot-out loss from qualifying for this event via last year's Asian Champions League, are at the quarterfinal stage of this season's ACL.\n\nAAP",

        "text": "When Ellie Egan heard her daughter's primary school was set to be temporarily closed due to low student numbers, she decided to take matters into her own hands.\n\nShe worked with other parents to find families interested in enrolling in Penrose Public School in the New South Wales Southern Highlands.\n\nEllie Egan says her young daughter is terrified by the prospect of having to go to another school in the next town. (ABC Illawarra: Sarah Moss)\n\nDespite their efforts, the NSW Department of Education confirmed the school would be put into \"recess\", with less than three months' notice.\n\n\"My daughter still asks me almost daily why her school is closing,\" Ms Egan said.\n\n\" She says if they knew how much she loves her school, they never would've done this. \"\n\nParents fight shutdown\n\nThe Education Department can decide to place a school in recess when there are \"questions about the school's ongoing viability\", according to department protocols.\n\nA school in recess does not enrol students, and staff and equipment are redeployed to nearby schools on an as-needs basis.\n\nPenrose is one of five regional public schools across NSW mothballed from the end of 2025 due to low enrolment numbers.\n\nKids in Penrose love their little school. (ABC Illawarra: Sarah Moss)\n\nThe school was expecting five students in 2026.\n\nBut parents argued their school's dip in enrolments was temporary and that the decision to put it in recess was premature.\n\n\"We managed to get a number of new families interested in coming to the school, but ultimately, it counted for nothing because the department didn't listen to us,\" Ms Egan said.\n\n\" We think it was basically just lip service, rather than a true consultation. \"\n\nMs Egan, on behalf of the school parents and citizens association (P&C), submitted a 25-page objection to the Department of Education.\n\nThe submission pointed to the department's own data, which showed Penrose could reach 16 enrolments by 2031.\n\nThe P&C canvassed the community for potential enrolments and claimed the figure could be higher.\n\nConcerns from the Penrose community have since been escalated to both the NSW Ombudsman and the Secretary of the Department of Education, Murat Dizdar.\n\nThe Department of Education declined the ABC's request for an interview.\n\nCapertee was one of five small regional schools put into recess at the end of 2025. (ABC Western Plains: Jonathan Hawes)\n\nConsultation 'didn't happen'\n\nSchools in Ben Lomond, Black Springs, Goolma and Capertee will also be shut down this year.\n\nIt brings the number of schools in recess across the state to 19.\n\nSchools in recess are reviewed by the department at least every two years, with sites maintained so they can be reopened if viable, or repurposed if not.\n\nWhen Shane Adams moved his family to the rural locality of Capertee, the public school was a major drawcard.\n\n\"We chose to live here because of the school. We need to think of our kids and their future,\" he said.\n\nFor spread-out farming and mining communities such as Capertee, having a centrally located school is seen as essential for growth. (ABC Western Plains: Jonathan Hawes)\n\nAcross the five schools placed into recess at the end of 2025, consultation periods ranged from as little as one month to about eight months.\n\nIn 2015, a parliamentary inquiry into NSW public school closures found a \"strong pattern\" of heavy-handed decision-making that lacked genuine community consultation, particularly in rural and primary school settings.\n\nMore than a decade on, parents said little had changed.\n\n\"The school my kids will have to go to is 4 kilometres further away, and towards nothing. This one was on my wife's way to work,\" Mr Adams said.\n\n\" The community consultation wasn't just lacking \u2014 it didn't happen at all. \"\n\nIs 'recess' different from 'closure'?\n\nUnder the 1990 Education Act, the NSW education minister must formally propose any school closure by June 15 each year, with schools forbidden from closing until the end of the following year.\n\nThis means there is at least an 18-month period to potentially reverse course on a closure.\n\nBut the legislation does not mention schools being placed in recess.\n\nGraeme Pike and Shane Adams say the department's consultation should include the broader community. (ABC Western Plains: Jonathan Hawes)\n\nThat decision is instead guided by the department's in-house procedures and guidelines, which do not set timeframes for consultation.\n\nThe guidelines list key stakeholders to be consulted, including school staff, the P&C, a NSW Teachers Federation organiser and the local MP.\n\nCapertee and District Progress Association president Graeme Pike argued that list was too narrow.\n\n\"If the Department of Education had chosen to consult with us, like they should've, then we would've told them how necessary the school is to the growth of the community,\" Mr Pike said.\n\n\" They consulted with people in Bathurst and Orange, but not with people just down the road. \"\n\nThe department said recess was preferable to closure, as the two-year review period allowed more time for enrolments to recover, compared to the 18-month process for closures mandated by the Education Act.\n\nIn the past decade, only one school has reopened after a period of recess \u2014 Premer Public School in the Liverpool Plains.\n\nFor former Goolma Public School bus driver Jean Ellis, that record offered little reassurance.\n\nJean Ellis says she is still coming to terms with the idea that Goolma Public School will not open this year. (ABC Western Plains: Jonathan Hawes)\n\nShe said she worried losing the school, however temporary, would be another nail in the Central Western community's coffin.\n\n\"When we first came here, there were multiple sports organisations, two churches, a shop, the pub, a fire shed, a village hall and the school. [Goolma] was thriving,\" she said.\n\n\"In recent years, the school became the only place left that was open and available to everyone.\n\n\"It was the only place to make community.\"",

        "text": "A baby beach tent that posed a drowning hazard and a car stand that could not support its advertised weight were among the nearly 3,000 unsafe products recently removed by online retailers.\n\nBut some businesses resumed selling the potentially fatal products, or took too long to remove them from their websites, according to a report from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).\n\nConsumer watchdog Choice said the report reveals \"product safety washing\" could be taking place in Australia's $60 billion online retail market.\n\nA baby beach tent that posed a drowning hazard was recalled by the ACCC in January 2025. (Supplied: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission)\n\nWhile some of Australia's largest retail platforms have signed up to a voluntary federal government \"safety pledge\", Choice campaign director Andy Kelly says it could instead be putting shoppers at risk.\n\nMr Kelly said safety washing happened when platforms gave the impression of upholding high safety standards without taking any meaningful action to keep consumers safe.\n\n\"The majority of Australians don't even really know that this is a problem,\" Mr Kelly said.\n\nAustralian Product Safety Pledge\n\nAmazon Australia, eBay Australia and Chinese retailer AliExpress are the current signatories to the pledge run by the ACCC, with Catch and myDeal leaving the scheme when they shut down in 2025.\n\nTemu's big Aussie ad spend infuriates mum of 9yo burnt in jumper fire Experts say Temu's strategy is causing a deluge of unsafe products to flood directly into Australian households.\n\nHowever, last year's Australian Product Safety Pledge annual report, which did not name operational retailers, said one business resumed selling unsafe products after they had been taken down.\n\nIn another case, it said a platform removed unsafe products within the required two-day timeframe in only 69 per cent of cases.\n\nAn ACCC spokesperson said the regulator was working with signatories to introduce more stringent requirements.\n\nThe Australian Product Safety Pledge is a voluntary initiative established by the ACCC in 2020. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nSpokespeople for Amazon Australia and eBay Australia said the companies had a strong commitment to product safety and used automated technology and human investigators to proactively detect and remove unsafe products.\n\nAlibaba, the owner of AliExpress, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n'Product safety washing'\n\nChoice has been calling for Australia to prohibit the sale of unsafe goods in line with the European Union, Canada and the US since 2020.\n\nCurrently, Australian laws are reactive and fines are given to companies found to have breached safety standards, with 18 companies fined since 2016.\n\nIt comes as a survey in 2024 found that most people mistakenly believe businesses are legally required to ensure products are safe.\n\nSome of Australia's largest retail platforms have signed up to a voluntary federal government \"safety pledge\". (ABC News: Yasmine Wright Gittins)\n\n\"There's a risk that certain businesses use [the pledge] to engage in product safety washing without actually taking meaningful action,\" Mr Kelly said.\n\nHe said the \"disappointing\" performance of some signatories showed the need for reform of Australian consumer law to prohibit the sale of unsafe goods.\n\nHe said online operators needed to take meaningful action on safety and not use the ACCC pledge as a \"marketing badge while falling short in practice\".\n\nTemu applies to join\n\nOne omission from the pledge is Temu, which has emerged as Australia's biggest online retailer.\n\nThe Chinese business said it would join the pledge in March 2024 after an eight-year-old girl was badly burnt while wearing a hoodie purchased from its platform.\n\nDaniella Jacobs-Herd sustained burns to 13 per cent of her body while wearing a hoodie her grandmother bought from Temu. (Supplied: Hannah Jacobs-Herd)\n\nBut last month, the company and the ACCC said its application was still in process.\n\nThe girl's mother, Hannah Jacobs-Herd, said she felt Temu's commitment to join the pledge was an example of the \"product safety washing\" referred to by Mr Kelly.\n\n\"I feel that it's just words they said to try and prolong the process and hoping this would all just be swept under the rug,\" she said.\n\nShine lawyers say Temu has deferred liability for the recalled hoodie to its Chinese supplier. (Reuters: Dado Ruvic/Illustration)\n\nMs Jacobs-Herd launched a lawsuit against Temu, which she said had stalled because the platform deferred liability for the hoodie to its Chinese supplier.\n\nTemu has banned that seller from selling children's products on its platform.\n\nA spokesperson for Shine Lawyers, the law firm handling the lawsuit, said attempts to contact the supplier directly had been unsuccessful.",

        "text": "Matildas star Mary Fowler has made her return to action in the Women's Super League, on a day of huge celebration for Manchester City.\n\nAfter nine-and-a-half months on the sidelines with an anterior cruciate ligament injury she suffered in last season's Women's FA Cup semifinal, Fowler came on as a substitute in the 75th minute of City's fabulous 5-1 victory over champions Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.\n\nShe was left beaming as she made her return with her side coasting at 5-1. City's two superstars Vivianne Miedema and Khadija Shaw, who'd both scored earlier in the game, both embraced with the 22-year-old on the touchline as they were replaced in the 76th minute.\n\nThe home crowd also rose as one to celebrate on what proved a landmark day, with City handing the ailing champions one of their worst ever WSL defeats. It felt like a changing-of-the-guard moment, with Chelsea now looking sure to be dethroned after six successive titles.\n\nFowler, inevitably, had to shake off some rustiness during her cameo but slotted in to her centre forward role comfortably enough as City eased to a win that puts them 11 points clear of neighbours Manchester United and 12 clear of Chelsea.\n\nSouth Korea boycott would be 'devastating' for Asian Cup Asian Cup organisers say they are hopeful the South Korean women's team will partake in next month's tournament despite threats of a boycott.\n\nThe visitors brought Fowler's Matildas captain Sam Kerr on early in the second half, but she proved largely ineffective with Chelsea already 3-0 down and being outclassed.\n\nTheir only consolation came from an Alyssa Thompson strike when they were 4-0 down.\n\nThe great news for Australia's Women's Asian Cup hopes is that both their key attacking threats should now be back in harness for the home tournament that begins on March 1 with a fixture against Philippines in Perth.\n\nAAP",

Behind the giant curved-class exterior on the second level, golden carpets lead to long, black bars where theatre-goers will order drinks in little plastic cups. Inside, 1500 \u201crainforest green\u201d seats stretch in front of a wide stage. The room feels intimate despite the scale of the building, which required more than 6300 cubic metres of concrete and 1500 tonnes of steel, along with all that glass. The visually stunning building was four years behind schedule. David Kelly On the stage, automated fly lines and sound shells hover at the ready, replacing hand-run systems at QPAC\u2019s older theatres. Backstage, 79 mirror spaces mean the theatre can easily accommodate larger performances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to architect Jayson Blight, who gave a tour to media on Monday, the mission of the building was to blend into the existing centre, not cast a shadow over it. He also said the complex structure of the 217 undulating panes meant they supported themselves. On stage at The Glasshouse. Julius Dennis \u201cThere is actually no structure holding up that glass,\u201d he told the crowd, some of whom laughing nervously. Named The Glasshouse after a public survey to choose a moniker, the theatre was meant to open its doors in 2022, but flooding and COVID-19 pushed it back four years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Arts Minister John-Paul Langbroek said there was no cost blowout to match, thanks to a $184 million guaranteed construction sum contract with the builder, Lendlease. The Queensland Performing Arts Centre contributed $25 million, with the rest provided by the state, he said. The level foyer behind the bending glass. Julius Dennis \u201cIt certainly has taken a long time, but it\u2019s really important to acknowledge that we\u2019re here now, and it\u2019s a wonderful theatre,\u201d Langbroek said. Public Works Minister Sam O\u2019Connor described the issues faced during the project as biblical.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe had the floods here in 2022; we had the COVID pandemic prior to that,\u201d he said, as well as laying blame at how \u201cthe former Labor government handled the CFMEU\u201d, who had a strong presence on the site throughout the project. Despite that dig, both ministers thanked the more than 2500 workers who brought the theatre to life. \u201cThey should all be proud of their efforts to produce what is truly one of the most beautiful buildings in our state,\u201d O\u2019Connor said. QPAC chief executive Rachel Healy said the new 1500-seat theatre \u2014 to go along with the 2000-seat Lyric \u2014 would attract an extra 300,000 visitors to the arts precinct annually. \u201cThe opening of the Glasshouse Theatre will also see us build on our reputation as one of Australia\u2019s most dynamic and popular cultural destinations,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the first shows to be performed at The Glasshouse is the April opening of musical The Last Ship, written and performed by Sting, the story of a British community losing their shipyard.

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe Australian sharemarket has extended its opening losses to be sharply lower at lunchtime, with shares exposed to gold and silver tumbling after the prices of the precious metals plunged over the weekend. Wall Street had an unsteady session on Friday. AP The S&P/ASX 200 was down 81.5 points or 0.9 per cent at 8787.6 in early trading, with six of 11 industry sectors lower. The Australian dollar lost ground as the US dollar rallied following President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh to be the next Federal Reserve chair. The Aussie was trading at US69.57\u00a2 at 12.33pm AEDT. Also on the agenda for local investors is the Reserve Bank\u2019s interest rates decision on Tuesday, with markets expecting the central bank to unveil its first rise in more than two years. In early trade, precious metal miners were battered with gold giants Northern Star (down 7.9 per cent), Evolution Mining (down 6.3 per cent) and Newmont (down 8.4 per cent) tumbling. Silver players also fell sharply with South32 losing 4.2 per cent. The falls came after the price of gold dropped 11.4 per cent to settle at $US4745.10 per ounce on Saturday. Gold\u2019s price suddenly lost momentum following a tremendous rally where it roughly doubled over 12 months. It topped $US5000 for the first time last week and was trading at around $US5600 at one point. Silver, which had been on a similar, jaw-dropping tear, fell even more. It plunged 31.4 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article US politics Trump taps former Federal Reserve insider to replace Powell \u201cThe total collapse in precious metals prices shows that any market can become gripped by mania,\u201d Kyle Rodda, a senior analyst at Capital.com, wrote in a note. \u201cGiven the build-up of positioning and leverage involved, the sell-off is bleeding into other markets. Effectively, a deleveraging is happening.\u201d Other mining stocks retreated. BHP lost 2 per cent, Rio Tinto fell 0.4 per cent and Fortescue dipped 0.1 per cent. Financial stocks are mixed, having shed some of their early gains. Commonwealth Bank led the way with a 1 per cent gain, while ANZ Bank added 0.8 per cent and Westpac advanced 0.6 per cent, but National Australia Bank fell 0.5 per cent. Energy stocks slid as oil prices retreated. Woodside Energy lost 0.8 per cent, Santos shed 2.2 per cent and Ampol dipped 0.1 per cent in early afternoon trade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsewhere, the founder and managing director of the embattled Corporate Travel Management, Jamie Pherous, is stepping down with immediate effect, months after trading in its shares was halted and following a scandal over alleged over-charging of government clients. Over the weekend, financial markets churned as investors tried to figure out what Trump\u2019s new nominee to lead the Federal Reserve would mean for interest rates. US stocks fell, with the S&P 500 down 0.4 per cent after sinking as much as 1.1 per cent earlier in the day. The Dow Jones dropped 179 points, or 0.4 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.9 per cent. Whoever leads the Fed has a big influence on the economy and markets worldwide by helping to dictate where the US central bank moves interest rates. Such decisions lift or weigh on prices for all kinds of investments, as the Fed tries to keep the US job market humming without letting inflation get out of control. Trump has been pushing for lower interest rates, which usually help goose the economy but can also cause higher inflation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe longtime assumption has been that the Fed should operate separately from the rest of Washington so that it can make moves that are painful in the short term but necessary for the long term. To get inflation down to the Fed\u2019s goal of 2 per cent, for example, may require the unpopular choice to keep interest rates high and grind down on the economy for a while. Kevin Warsh has been a supporter of lowering interest rates. Bloomberg The big question is what Warsh\u2019s nomination, which still requires approval from the Senate, means for the Fed\u2019s independence. Warsh used to be a governor on the Fed\u2019s board, so investors are familiar with him. That could also mean Warsh is familiar with and hopes to continue the institution of the Fed as an independent operator. And while with the Fed, Warsh criticised the central bank\u2019s buying of bonds to keep interest rates low. Some on Wall Street took Warsh\u2019s nomination as an encouraging signal for a still-independent Fed that will keep rates high, if necessary. Besides slowing the economy, higher interest rates would push downward on stock prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Warsh has also recently been critical of the Fed\u2019s current chair, Jerome Powell, and has voiced support for lower rates. Helping to limit the market\u2019s losses was Tesla, which rose 3.3 per cent. It bounced back after dropping on Thursday despite delivering better profit reports for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

Got it Share A A A\n\nDalaroo Metals has moved a step closer to de-risking its Blue Lagoon critical minerals project in southern Greenland after confirming the discovery of a zircon-dominated heavy mineral system, just as Western governments are scrambling to secure alternative supply chains outside China. Geochemical analysis results from surface and shallow auger sampling obtained during the company\u2019s maiden 2025 field program have landed in Dalaroo\u2019s inbox, and have confirmed a strong, consistent correlation between zirconium and hafnium - a textbook signature of zircon-hosted mineralisation. Lagoon and shoreline sediments at Dalaroo Metals\u2019 Blue Lagoon critical minerals project in south-west Greenland. The tight relationship suggests the heavy minerals are being naturally concentrated within lagoonal and shoreline sediments, pointing to a laterally continuous system that has already been upgraded by nature through mechanical processes. Dalaroo believes natural sedimentary and hydraulic processes have done much of the beneficiation work upfront. Wave action and shoreline sorting have concentrated dense, chemically resistant minerals into near-surface traps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018These results represent an important step in systematically de-risking the Blue Lagoon project.\u2019 Dalaroo Metals chief executive officer John Morgan The strong zirconium\u2013hafnium correlation also delivers a practical exploration advantage. The zirconium mineralisation is proving to be a practical pathfinder element, enabling handheld X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) surveys for rapid, real-time targeting in the field. This geological simplicity could be the key to future development. Heavy mineral sands systems are typically shallow, flat-lying and amenable to straightforward gravity separation. These factors can lead to shorter, cheaper development timelines, coupled with reduced technical risk compared to many hard-rock critical minerals projects. Notably, the zirconium\u2013hafnium relationship shows up across multiple sample types and locations, supporting the company\u2019s view of a broad, sedimentary heavy mineral system rather than isolated or structurally controlled occurrences - a level of consistency that materially de-risks the project at an early stage. Recent surface samples have thrown up 0.81 per cent total rare earth oxides (TREO), alongside consistently high-grade zirconium oxide reaching up to 4.42 per cent. The project has also returned substantial hafnium grades up to 99 parts per million (ppm) hafnium oxide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe project was secured by Dalaroo Metals Limited just a month ago and its initial work \u2014 the first systematic exploration since the late 1970s \u2014 has outlined a 2.7km strike zone with standout critical mineral grades, pointing to a potential district-scale rare earth elements and zirconium discovery. Zirconium and hafnium are both listed as critical minerals due to their roles in advanced manufacturing, aerospace, defence technologies and nuclear applications. Hafnium, in particular, is prized for its use in semiconductors, nuclear control rods and high-temperature alloys, and currently trades at a whopping AU$17,000 per kilogram. Zirconium, meanwhile, is essential in ceramics, refractories and nuclear fuel cladding. Blue Lagoon also holds a promising rare earths inventory, dominated by the prized elements dysprosium and terbium - critical for the manufacturing of strong, permanent magnets used in electric vehicle motors, wind turbine generators, and other renewable technologies. Crucially, uranium and thorium analyses have remained low and are well below Greenland\u2019s mandated 100ppm threshold, smoothing the regulatory path to any future development. Greenland has emerged as a focal point for Western critical minerals strategy, sitting within NATO territory and increasingly viewed as a stable, transparent jurisdiction capable of supplying zirconium, hafnium and rare earth elements into allied markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDalaroo\u2019s wholly owned Blue Lagoon project sits in the south-west corner of Greenland, well below the Arctic Circle and within the Gardar Alkaline Province, which is a globally recognised belt prospective for zirconium, niobium, hafnium and rare earth elements. Dalaroo Metals chief executive officer John Morgan said: \u201cThese results represent an important step in systematically de-risking the Blue Lagoon project. Confirming zircon as the dominant host mineral provides confidence that heavy mineral concentrations are laterally continuous and potentially amenable to simple gravity processing methods. Heavy mineral systems globally are typically associated with shallow mining, low strip ratios and straightforward beneficiation flowsheets.\u201d Next up, Dalaroo plans to bring in specialist consultants to run detailed mineralogical, metallurgical and process characterisation test work. The program will include heavy mineral separation, automated mineralogical microanalysis (QEMSCAN) and gravity recovery testing. Expanded shoreline sampling, handheld XRF mapping and additional shallow drilling are also on the to-do list. With critical minerals now front-and-centre in Western industrial and defence policy and Greenland firmly in the geopolitical spotlight, Dalaroo\u2019s Blue Lagoon project appears to be shaping up as a strategically located, technically simple and potentially scalable source of minerals the world is increasingly desperate to secure.

But can we confabulate about the comic brilliance of Catherine O\u2019Hara? These radically arcane words, like so many others, dripped off the gifted comedian\u2019s tongue so silkily as Moira, her singularly eccentric matriarch in Schitt\u2019s Creek, that you laughed well before you wondered what the heck they meant.

O\u2019Hara said she\u2019d created the character by thinking of women married to wealthy men \u2013 women who wanted to be seen as special, in their own right. Her unique look included a series of eccentric wigs. \u201cI knew a woman who would have dinner parties at her house and she would keep disappearing and coming back with different wigs.

CTM told the ASX on Monday morning that Pherous would retire as chief executive and board member, with chief commercial officer Ana Pedersen to act as chief executive of the travel agency while a permanent replacement is found. Pherous, also the group\u2019s second-largest shareholder, will move to an \u201cadvisory role\u201d under a six-month consulting agreement with the company. CTM boss Jamie Pherous is retiring amid a long-term suspension of the company\u2019s shares. Attila Csaszar Chairman Ewen Crouch said the board had determined now was the \u201cappropriate time to accelerate the transition to a refreshed corporate structure\u201d, while acknowledging the problems the company had faced. Crouch acknowledged the need for change given the scale of the scandal, which will cost investors dearly, but avoided laying any blame at the feet of CTM\u2019s charismatic founder, who started the business more than three decades ago.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe recognise his impact, but as a board, must also focus on the evolution of the business,\u201d Crouch said. \u201cClearly, we have let shareholders down over recent months. We understand that, and we\u2019ve heard first-hand their deep frustration. It\u2019s important that we learn from these events and create a strong and sustainable structure that can help us restore trust in the business.\u201d CTM chairman Ewen Crouch, pictured in 2016. Louie Douvis Crouch would not give speculate on whether CTM would be in a position to release the 2025 financial year accounts before the current financial year ends on June 30. \u201cThere is confidence that we will complete the process to enable the company to relist. I cannot give you a specific date,\u201d Crouch said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCTM shares have been suspended for months, after the company last year flagged minor accounting issues that then ballooned into massively overcharging the UK government for services including housing asylum seekers on large-scale barges including the controversial Bibby Stockholm. Related Article Opinion\n\nScandal The pitchforks are out for this Aussie travel company Elizabeth Knight Business columnist The company had previously told the ASX that these asylum seeker contracts would be worth $3 billion over several years, but the controversy over asylum seekers in the UK, and a change of government, led to abrupt changes to the deal. CTM\u2019s woes have raised concerns it was charging too much to house the asylum seekers in hotels across the UK under contracts arranged by the former Conservative government. According to UK reports, CTM has won \u00a33.9 billion ($7.7 billion) in public sector contracts over the past decade. The company also holds the contract for managing Australian government travel until 2027. Finance Minister Katy Gallagher confirmed that CTM agreed to an independent audit of its business in the light of the overcharging claims.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPedersen, CTM\u2019s acting chief executive, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been made public what the Australian government is intending on doing, and we\u2019re working very closely with them, and that process will commence very shortly.\u201d That deal to manage Australian government travel has not been implicated in the overcharging scandal and there is no suggestion Pherous was involved in the broader issues. CTM had a market valuation of $2.35 billion when shares last traded, but some analysts have halved their value of the stock and one investor has written off its valuation entirely.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nThe closure of the Afghan embassy in Canberra, in the pipeline for some time, has now been confirmed with a timeline.\n\nThe embassy will officially shut on the 30th of June this year.\n\nThe decision comes after reports late last year that the Australian government advised the embassy's ambassador, Wahidullah Waissi, that his diplomatic credentials would not be renewed.\n\nCEO of the Afghan Women on the Move organisation, Maryam Zahid, says it's a substantial loss for the Afghan diaspora in Australia.\n\n\"This announcement has created a lot of fear, confusion and disappointment. because this embassy for Afghan diaspora here in Australia, it was more than a diplomatic platform, especially for women and elders, it was a place of connection, identity. They could have or they should have worked with Afghan diaspora and ask us what we need and they didn't do that.\"\n\nThe Afghan embassy has served as a diplomatic, cultural and community bridge between Afghan Australians, civil society organisations, schools and universities, plus local, state and federal government.\n\nMs Zahid says the closure leaves a gap the government is yet to explain how it will fill.\n\n\"Because our government here in Australia hasn't offered us something to replace it in terms of having a community platform outside of religious views, community politics, and fights about who is who in the community, that hasn't been given to us, and it hasn't been invested in the Afghan community.\"]]\n\nThe diplomatic mission had been operating as an embassy-in-exile following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.\n\nIt continued to issue official documents such as passports and visas, and to verify IDs for thousands of Afghan citizens living in Australia.\n\nHowever, its services haven't been operating normally since the Taliban announced in July 2024 that it would no longer recognise consular documents issued by 14 embassies related to the former republic, including the Canberra facility.\n\nDirector of the Afghan Cultural Association of Newcastle Sami Zakhil told SBS Pashto for this reason, he doesn't expect the closure to have a significant impact.\n\n\"The embassy has largely operated in a symbolic capacity and, by its own admission, has not been in contact with the current government in Kabul. As a result, it has not been able to meaningfully assist Afghans with consular or official matters.\"\n\nProfessor of Diplomacy at Australian National University, William Maley, says the decision to close the embassy follows a demand from the Taliban that all embassies under the control of an anti-Taliban ambassador be closed.\n\n\"Even though Australia might deny a connection between the letter and the decision, this really dents, if not fatally, Australia's credibility when complaining about the human rights performance of the Taliban. It's a terrible blow not only to the Afghan community, but also to Australian service personnel who served in Afghanistan, they really would feel like the government has spat in their faces.\"\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the government doesn't intend to accept a Taliban-appointed representative in a statement which in part reads:\n\n\"We do not recognise the Taliban as the legitimate representatives of the Afghan people. We strongly condemn the Taliban\u2019s persistent systematic abuses of human rights, particularly against women and girls, and voices of dissent. We reaffirm our shared commitment to human rights and the dignity of the people of Afghanistan.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the foreign minister told SBS the Albanese government \"will not accept a Taliban representative.\"\n\nBut Professor Maley says DFAT's official statement doesn't rule it out as an option in future .\n\n\"If one looks at the statement that was put out of the Foreign Affairs Department, it's rather slippery on that particular point. It didn't say that Australia will never accept a Taliban diplomat representative or honorary consulate, it said Australia has no intention of doing so. And of course that's the kind of wording that people use if they want later to be able to say, oh, well we didn't intend it at the time, but we changed our minds.\"\n\nMs Zahid says she's firmly against the prospect of Australia accepting a Taliban representative as a diplomatic figurehead.\n\n\u201cI'd be more than upset and women like me in communities that are very much against having that kind of mind-set and ideologies to represent us. That would be a big no for us. And I'm sure we can at least rust this promise from our government, that our embassy will not be controlled or represented by those views.\"\n\nHowever, not everyone is opposed to the idea.\n\nFazal Katawazai, a former Afghan diplomat in Australia, says a relationship should be established to avoid further practical issues for Afghan Australians.\n\n\"The closure will create significant practical hurdles for Afghan Australians planning to visit Afghanistan. And also the travel documents, passport problems. In some extent, I think Australia need to have some kind of consular relationship as an honorary consular in Australia with the existing Taliban government.\"\n\nNeither the Australian government nor the embassy have outlined how Afghan citizens will receive essential consular services.\n\nErfan Abidi is the founder of an underground network of schools for girls in Afghanistan, and an active member of the Afghan community in Adelaide.\n\nHe told SBS Pashto for his community, the decision to close the embassy is about much more than being able to travel back to Afghanistan.\n\n\"For many Afghans in Australia, the Afghanistan embassy is more than an office. It is a wider symbol of identity, dignity, and connection to your homeland. It has also been the only official space where Afghans, particularly Afghan women, could raise their voices, share their concerns, and advocate for their rights. The panned closure feels like another fall of Afghanistan, but this time in exile, not in Afghanistan.\"",

        "text": "After building a life here for over a decade, all Reyna Nangan dreams for her family \u2014 especially her eight-year-old daughter, Kaia \u2014 is to call Australia home.\n\n\"Kaia did have a lot of opportunity here in Australia,\" Reyna told SBS News. \"She did thrive really well.\n\n\"That's the one thing that I don't want to be taken from her, that opportunity ... I know that she can be something, someday.\"\n\nReyna and her partner, Karin Yechoku, from the Philippines and Thailand, have lived in Australia for over 14 years. They own a restaurant in Toowoomba, where their daughter was born and has spent her entire life.\n\nNow, they are at risk of deportation.\n\n'It's not Australia that doesn't want you'\n\nReyna said their bid for permanent residency fell through after a past employer failed to follow through on a visa application, leaving them in bureaucratic limbo.\n\n\"A lot of times I questioned myself, why? Why even I'm here if Australia doesn't want me?\" she said.\n\n\"But then ... I correct myself, 'it's not Australia that doesn't want you, okay? It's just the system ... and especially it's not the people of Australia that [don't] want you. You are loved by them.'\"\n\nNangan said Kaia is \"pretty aware of what is going on ... I always keep telling her that, we do what we can, and then God will do the rest\". Credit: SBS\n\nThe family's application for ministerial intervention was denied at the end of last year, when it was found not to be a substantiative public interest case.\n\nWhile the Department of Home Affairs said it cannot comment on individual cases for privacy reasons, a spokesperson said in a statement that \"Visa applicants remain legally responsible for meeting visa criteria even where they suffer disadvantage due to employer misconduct, negligence, or failure\".\n\nThe minister does not generally intervene to \"fix\" individual visa outcomes, except in very limited, exceptional circumstances, the spokesperson said.\n\nReyna, however, has not given up and has filed a second request with the immigration minister for consideration. The family has been approved for a bridging visa while they await a decision.\n\n\"I'm the one in the family making sure that this fight will carry through,\" she said.\n\n'They are just so kind to us'\n\nReyna and her family are not alone in the fight, with community members who greet them at their restaurant with a smile and a hug telling them they support them.\n\nAlmost 4,000 people signed a petition calling for the immigration minister to intervene in the case and allow the family to stay in Australia\n\nDale Hockey, a customer of their restaurant for many years, said he was \"heartbroken\" when he heard about the family's visa situation.\n\n\"It broke my heart, it really did. They are just so kind to us ... I'll do anything I can for them,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\"They've always been the genuine kind people that they have been ... They treat you like family, and I do feel like they are family.\"\n\nToowoomba has a diverse community, according to the last census, with about 14 per cent of residents here born overseas, and many proud of the area's rich mix of cultures.\n\nJane Schuller, another customer of the family's restaurant, said the family \"deserves to be Australian\".\n\n\"They're to me what Australia wants ... These are good-hearted, honest, hardworking people and I know that they've worked all the time since they've been here,\" she told SBS News.\n\n'Finally called home'\n\nGarth Hamilton, the local Federal MP of Groom, has also joined calls for the family to be allowed to stay.\n\n\"The amount of people in my community who have reached out and said, 'We have to do something about this, this can't be right.' It's been across the board, from some of our most prominent business people to people passing me in the street,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\"I am gonna be as optimistic as possible all the way through, and I think that's what they need around them.\n\n\"Anyone in this situation needs people just to consider no other option, but that they're gonna stay and continue to contribute, be a part of our community.\"\n\nHamilton said his team is engaged with Home Affairs and they are \"working through it\".\n\nDespite the anxious wait, Reyna has been overwhelmed with the support she's received.\n\n\"I'm grateful to all of them ... We are far away from our families, but then God make sure that we have families here, too,\" she said.\n\nShe also has a message for Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke.\n\n\"We are a family that just wanted what is good for our child,\" she said.\n\n\"We just want ... Australia to be finally called our home, [so] that we don't have to think of our visa all the time.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nToday, human beings spend a great deal of time in front of their televisions.\n\nAustralians spend between two and a half and three hours watching broadcast and on-delay TV every day.\n\nIf you add in streaming services, some studies suggest that figure could be as high as six hours a day.\n\nWhich is quite an impact when you consider that it's only a hundred years since TV was invented.\n\nThe name John Logie Baird is synonymous with the history of television.\n\nHe was a businessman, but above all an inventor and he gave the first public demonstration of what would become known as television in January 1926 at his Soho Laboratory in Frith Street in London.\n\nUnlike the electronic systems that would follow, Baird's Televisor was mechanical.\n\nLewis Pollard is the Curator of Television and Broadcast, Science and Media Museum in the United Kingdom.\n\nHe says it was a breakthrough but extremely difficult to operate.\n\n\"It was very technical, very complicated and because Baird was such a pioneer in what he was doing, he had to be essentially making a lot of his equipment from scratch or using whatever you might have had around the lab. So the apparatus we have on site in the museum has parts of an old hatbox, a bicycle lamp, and it was very DIY because you couldn't just go to a shop and buy the pieces you needed because television didn't exist.\"\n\nThe BBC launched the world\u2019s first regularly scheduled TV service in 1936 in the UK, but as this newsreel footage suggests, it was viewed as a bit of a novelty, and a distraction from the serious work of radio.\n\n\"The BBC's first regular television broadcasts began on the 2nd November 1936, introduced by Leslie Mitchell. There was no colour of course, pictures were strictly black and white or, as some cynics suggested, black and dark grey. But definition improved with usage. Transmission was limited to two hours a day.\"\n\nIn 1938 Logie Baird spoke to British Movietone newsreel audiences in Australia and New Zealand, where television did not start until 1956, nearly two decades later.\n\n\"It is now 12 years ago since I produced the first little flickering television image. Today we have in London a regular television service twice daily with thousands of lookers-in (viewers). Television has grown from a scientific novelty to a commercial service. At present the range is limited to 30 miles in and about London. In this connection it is interesting to note that as far back as 1928 I spanned the Atlantic with television. That was of course purely experimental but who can foretell the future.\"\n\nCertainly there had been huge improvements since those early days.\n\nLogie Baird had to use a ventriloquist's dummy as a subject for that first broadcast as the lighting employed was so intense, anything being lit had a tendency to catch fire.\n\nBy 1953, the technology had improved so much that the BBC felt confident enough to launch its biggest outside broadcast to date - the coronation of Queen Elizabeth the second, with their program being recorded on film as it was broadcast, and sent around the world.\n\nLewis Pollard again.\n\n\"Any TV camera in the UK that could be mobilised was mobilised for use during the coronation. It was such a large media event that's why so many people remember it. We talk, here the museum about, the millions of people who watched, but one thing that people might not be so familiar with is the televisions in the 1950s were larger than Baird's Televisor, but still very small and the records say something like 17 people watched each television set, which would be half the size of a contemporary TV, maybe even smaller than that. So, for people watching at home, you know, it was such a big moment that it really helped, I'd say it really helped cement television as part of people's everyday lives. It went from this novelty that some people might have to, oh, I should have this in my home as well. And that's what really made television go as big as it did in the UK.\"\n\nThe next revolution came with the ability to record television programs in high quality for later broadcast.\n\nThe first broadcast quality video recorder was the Ampex VRX-1000, a gigantic machine which American broadcaster CBS first used in earnest in 1956.\n\nIt was the size of a piano, and cost $50,000 US - the equivalent of 900,000 Australian dollars today.\n\nLogie Baird had already foreseen the importance of being able to record video, and had come up with his own system many years earlier.\n\n\"He was also really, experimenting with the idea of being able to record television signals, because in those days, all television as it went out was live. There was no way of recording such vast amounts of data in any way, shape or form. And Baird was working with a system he called Phonovision, which was recording both the image and sound components of a television broadcast onto essentially like a vinyl disc and the really interesting story behind that is we have some of those discs in our collection, and they weren't essentially translated until much, much later, until after Baird had passed away, because he had a way of encoding the information onto a disc. We had no way of decoding it. So as far as he was aware, that system may or may not have worked. And it was until much later that we proved that actually, yes, it did work.\"\n\nFrom a flickering black-and-white novelty to cinema-quality colour in the palm of our hand, visual media has come a very long way in a hundred years.",

We don't want to be left as a second thought or an inconvenience in this ever-changing world. We want to be there in the forefront with you standing by you, not standing behind you.\u201d\n\nUncle John Baxter was deeply involved in the exhibition's creation from the planning stage.\n\nHis installation 'Not Fit For Purpose' also telling an important story.\n\n\u201cSometimes when we receive this equipment, they're not fit for purpose. We think that they may be, or somebody else has thought on our behalf that, oh yes, uncle needs a wheelchair, so we'll give them a wheelchair. They may not realize that Uncle lives in a remote community. There are no footpaths. There are no sealed roads. You're going down dirt tracks. Uncle wants to be a part of his culture.\u201d\n\nAccessibility is woven into the exhibition's design, including elements such as tactile panels, audio descriptions, Auslan interpretation and large print materials.\n\nThis is Trevor Ahearn, the major projects lead in the First Nations department at the Australian Museum.\n\n\u201cWe also wanted to create a design language that sort of made access prominent, a prominent theme, not just for people with access needs, but for people who able bodied people, people who don't have access needs to come in and be aware of what it takes to make a thing accessible.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, about one quarter of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people report having a disability.\n\nThis exhibition also highlighting the intersection of ableism and racism.\n\nThis is Gayle Kennedy, a Wongaiibon Clan member.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to know us, look at our eyes, see the power in them, see the strength. And not only as Aboriginal people, but as people with disabilities, because as far as I'm concerned, we are the most marginalized people in any society worldwide.\u201d\n\nA vessel for truth telling - each of the 30 participants told their story on their own terms.\n\n\u201cI think that you could see that in all of these photographs.

        "text": "Kazuyo Kitada used to work seven days a week \u2014 9am to midnight on weekdays, and 9am to 5pm on weekends.\n\nOn one occasion, a client called the office at 2am. The following day, Kitada\u2019s employer asked her why she wasn't there.\n\n\"I need sleep,\" she recalls thinking.\n\nIt was the 1990s, and Kitada was working in Japan for an IT company where she would ultimately spend two decades. At the time, she was putting in long hours on a tough project for a difficult customer, she tells SBS News.\n\nSince moving to Australia 16 years ago, she's observed a workforce culture that she says focuses much more on the individual than the company.\n\n\"If someone is ill, of course, that project would be delayed,\" she says, contrasting the relative flexibility in Australian workplaces with the unmoving project deadlines she previously experienced.\n\n\"Twenty years ago, in Japan, if something happened on the first day of a family trip, you have to [go] back to the company, right?\n\nIt's company: number one. Working: number one.\n\nThose expectations weren't unusual in Japan, which has long struggled with a notoriously punishing work culture marked by long hours and untenable workloads, driving a host of work-related health problems.\n\nDeath by overwork became so familiar in Japan that it has a name: karoshi.\n\nBut like many countries, Japan has seen a significant shift in attitudes towards work over the past decade, particularly among younger people and notably since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe issue was thrust back into the spotlight in October with the appointment of a new prime minister, whose personal attitude to work has fuelled controversy at home and abroad.\n\nA leader who will 'work, work, work, work, work'\n\nWhile the extreme work culture of decades past has been on its way out for some time, overwork remains a major social flashpoint.\n\nThat's why it sparked such debate when Japan's new leader, conservative Sanae Takaichi, made a personal commitment to abandon work-life balance, vowing to \"work, work, work, work, work\" and encouraging her party's members to do the same.\n\nShe made international headlines again in November last year, when she called a 3am meeting with aides, claiming she sleeps as little as two to four hours a night.\n\nIt stirred concerns that she is modelling a work ethic that many Japanese people are striving to move away from.\n\nJapan's National Defense Counsel for Victims of Karoshi said her comments \"could force workers, including government employees, to overwork and work long hours and could revive an outdated mentality\".\n\nIt also drew backlash from labour unions and some members of parliament.\n\nYoshihiko Noda, a former prime minister and leader of the main opposition party, called the 3am meeting \"crazy\" in an interview with the New York Times.\n\n\"It\u2019s a very sad attitude for the top leader of the country to show,\" he said.\n\nTakaichi's \"work, work, work\" remark earned the title of Japan's 2025 buzzword of the year, awarded by publishing house Jiy\u016b Kokumin Sha, and sparked further backlash from the families of karoshi victims.\n\nSanae Takaichi, leader of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, was elected prime minister by Japan\u2019s parliament last October. Source: Getty / Rodrigo Reyes Marin/Pool/Anadolu\n\nAt the award ceremony, Takaichi emphasised that she did not intend to suggest that long working hours are a virtue, nor to encourage them among the public.\n\nStill, Hiroshi Ono, a professor of human resources at Tokyo's Hitotsubashi University, tells SBS News the prime minister's original messaging sent the \"wrong signal\".\n\n\"That's exactly what we're not supposed to do,\" he says.\n\n\"If that was not Takaichi [and] that was a private company, they'd be blacklisted.\n\nCalling a meeting at three in the morning \u2014 no, you can't do that.\n\nIn Japan, \"black companies\" refer to employers known for exploitative labour practices and excessive working hours. Since 2017, the government has published lists of companies that violate employment laws.\n\nTakaichi is also looking to relax Japan's overtime restrictions, currently capped at 45 hours a month, as employers contend with significant labour shortages and a shrinking working-age population.\n\nThat overtime cap was introduced as part of work-style reforms passed in 2019, which were intended to \"correct this work culture of excessive work hours, karoshi\", Ono says.\n\nTakaichi's approval rating sky high\n\nDespite her controversial remarks about work, Takaichi has received exceptionally high approval ratings \u2014 north of 70 per cent in some polls \u2014 with very strong support from younger voters.\n\nIn December, her approval stood at more than 92 per cent among voters aged 18 to 29 and 83 per cent among those aged 30 to 39, according to a joint poll by the Sankei Shimbun newspaper and Fuji News Network, a television network.\n\nA small survey of 100 Japanese working women aged 20 to 49 last year found that more than half took Takaichi's remarks about work positively, with many viewing it as a personal declaration of her resolve.\n\nAnother survey, conducted by the Shufu JOB Research Institute, found that respondents had \"high expectations\" for the new administration regarding the promotion of women's workforce participation.\n\nYounger generations, particularly those raising children, appeared to hold high hopes that the appointment of the first female prime minister would lead to improvements in working conditions.\n\nREAD MORE Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi dissolves parliament after three months in office\n\nRyoko Yoshida is a 38-year-old who works in Japan's automotive industry.\n\nShe tells SBS News that while Japan is growing out of the \"work, work, work\" mentality, she suspects Takaichi felt compelled to aggressively promote her own work ethic as the first woman in the role.\n\nBut Yoshida doesn't read the prime minister's rhetoric as a call for the working population to mirror it.\n\n\"It's still a society where women [are] quite looked down upon,\" she says.\n\n\"You can see how motivated she is as a PM. I think it worked for younger people.\"\n\nThis month, Takaichi, who took on the premier role after her predecessor resigned, called a snap election for 8 February. She told reporters she wanted \"the people to decide directly whether they can entrust the management of the country to me\".\n\nUnwinding a deeply-embedded culture\n\nIn the decades following World War Two, Japan's rapid economic rebuild entrenched a work-first culture that prioritised output, endurance and company loyalty.\n\n\"There was no upper bound to your work hours. And so literally, we had people that were working to death,\" Ono says.\n\nMore than five decades since the first documented case of karoshi, Japan records thousands of compensation claims for death and illness linked to excessive work each year, according to government data, including cases involving stroke, heart disease, mental health issues and suicide.\n\nRecognised cases of karoshi linked to heart or brain failure have declined over the past decade, according to data from Japan\u2019s health ministry, but a record number of people applied for mental health-related compensation in 2024.\n\nAlong with cost of living pressures, stagnant wages and entrenched gender roles, Japan's strenuous work culture is widely blamed for making it difficult for young people to raise families, exacerbating the country's perennially low birthrate.\n\nIn a bid to remedy that, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government introduced a flexible work system in April that gives employees the option to work four days a week while maintaining the same total working hours over a four-week period.\n\nGovernment figures show that working hours for full-time employees declined sharply in 2019, the year that work reforms were legislated, while uptake of paid leave started to rise.\n\n\"The work-style reform act of 2019 seems to have had some impact in improving the quality of life and quality of work in Japan,\" Ono says.\n\nFull-time employees in Japan receive a legal minimum of 10 to 20 days of annual leave, depending on length of service. The 2019 reforms stipulated that employers ensure workers take at least five days of paid leave a year.\n\nA generational shift\n\nOno, who is in his 50s, says his generation \"didn't ask questions\" and stuck to the status quo when it came to work.\n\n\"There is definitely a significant generational divide,\" he says. \"Younger people these days definitely value their personal time, and they're very much against this long-working-hour culture.\"\n\nSimilarly, Kitada, 57, who now works as a producer for SBS Japanese, says young people in Japan have the courage to \"speak up more than my era\".\n\nReflecting on how she used to work, she says it's \"really crazy\" to think about.\n\n\"But at that time, it's normal, because everybody worked the same way.\"\n\nYoshida, a millennial working in supply chain management, says her work hours are pretty flexible, and she's rarely expected to do overtime.\n\nShe believes younger generations are more broadly aware of their entitlements and prioritise work-life balance.\n\n\"I think younger people are not afraid to speak up to their bosses, and they don't mind being judged for [it],\" she says.\n\nThis is our boundary.\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with SBS Japanese, with additional reporting from Kate Onomichi.\n\nReaders seeking crisis support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14, the Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467 and Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800 (for young people aged up to 25).\n\nMore information and support with mental health is available at beyondblue.org.au and on 1300 22 4636.\n\nEmbrace Multicultural Mental Health supports people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "Around 600 feral camels in central Australia have been culled this week following an emergency meeting to overcome the animals wreaking 'havoc' in remote communities.\n\nA dry spell has led to large herds coming into Indigenous communities as they search for water, damaging mains and fences in their path.\n\nWorking as an area manager for MacDonnell Regional Council, Damien Ryan has experienced the issue firsthand.\n\n\"One morning last week, there was a leak off one of the buildings ... there were 80 camels clambering to get that little bit of water,\" he said.\n\n\"They just walk through six-foot-high security fences and they knock the taps off the outside walls ... they will break water mains a metre underground just to get to water.\"\n\nDamien Ryan says the camels are very destructive and a large cleanup will be required. Source: Facebook\n\nThis month, a dozen homes in the community of Mount Liebig \u2014 about 320km west of Alice Springs \u2014 were left without a water supply due to the damage, on days over 40C.\n\n\"There's a big cleanup operation,\" Ryan said.\n\nAs many as 800-1000 camels travelling in one direction \u2014 known as a 'camel train' \u2014 have been reported by residents, spanning 5km in length near Mount Liebig and Papunya.\n\nAccording to government assessments, this can happen in summer or during droughts, when herds congregate.\n\nWe're talking about large bull camels weighing hundreds of kilos that just want water and they're willing to do anything. NT Environment Minister Josh Burgoyne\n\nBurgoyne said the issue has caused \"absolute havoc\".\n\n\"Imagine waking up one morning and seeing hundreds of camels in your local community, and they can get quite aggressive\", he said.\n\nRyan said when water sources dry up, the camels \"smell water\" and find what they can.\n\n\"I've lived in central Australia all my life. They're some of the biggest camels I've ever seen,\" he said.\n\nThe Arabian camel, which is the only species found feral in Australia, weighs between 450 and 650kg. Source: Supplied / Damien Ryan\n\nA joint taskforce has been set up between the NT government, MacDonnell Regional Council and the Central Land Council (CLC), which approved a three-day aerial cull this week to assist.\n\nThe CLC says around 150 camels are being killed each day once they're moved from exclusion zones such as communities, outstations and roads.\n\nWhen rain returns, they disappear 'like fairy floss'\n\nCamels were first introduced to Australia in 1840, and by 2008, around one million of them were roaming the arid lands of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Queensland.\n\nAccording to a State of the Environment report by the federal government, the Australian Feral Camel Management Project between 2008 and 2013 removed more than 160,000 camels, at a cost of $19 million.\n\nThe project also supported the development of a commercial feral camel industry and contributed to a reduction of the feral population to around 300,000.\n\nThe distribution of feral camels in Australia in 2008. (Sourced: Australia State of Environment Report 2016) Source: Supplied\n\nExperts say a severely dehydrated camel can drink 100 litres of water in ten minutes.\n\nAs soon as rain returns, Ryan said the camels move on.\n\n\"Saturday night we got a little rain and Sunday night we got a good storm, and next morning the camels had disappeared like fairy floss,\" he said.\n\n\"The issue still stands, there are thousands of camels now, the camel experts say between seven and nine years, the herd doubles.\"\n\nLarge herds of camels in Mount Liebig have caused damage to fencing and water infrastructure. Source: Supplied / NT Government\n\nCalls for federal support\n\nBurgoyne says the NT government is doing what it can, but thinks \"the emphasis has really gone off\" solving the problem, calling for more money to undertake larger-scale culls.\n\n\"Local councils are quite literally having to hunt these camels out in the morning so that the communities can be safe,\" he said.\n\nYou imagine in Sydney or Melbourne, if a mob of feral camels came in, dug up the local water supply and residents were without water for a week or two, I think we would see absolute outrage.\n\nThe federal government said states and territories have primary responsibility for the management of invasive species.\n\nA Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water spokesperson said in a statement: \"Through the Saving Native Species program, the Australian Government has invested over $4.9 million in two projects delivered by the Northern Territory Government and Central Land Council.\"\n\n\"These projects aim to improve the habitat and help threatened species recover in the MacDonnell Ranges and include activities such as feral camel control.\"\n\nSafety and looking after animal welfare\n\nThe Central Land Council (CLC), which represents 90 elected Aboriginal men and women across southern NT, said there's a need to protect threatened species and country while keeping people safe.\n\nCLC representative Mischa Cartwright told SBS News the council culled more than 1,400 camels in 2025.\n\n\"There's really no other options than to go through a humane culling process,\" she said.\n\n\"I think communities, as long as they're consulted properly as part of that project, they're quite comfortable ... because it is about protecting our certain species in our country and the safety of our communities as well.\"\n\nConcerns have also been raised about the animals' welfare as local governments can't turn on water for huge numbers of camels.\n\n\"There maybe needs to be some outlying water points in the future for camels in that situation. And when I say outlying, they need to be a fair way away from communities,\" Ryan said.\n\nRyan has seen camels get stuck, as damaged water taps leak and make the ground muddy.\n\nDamien Ryan says camels are often found bogged in muddy ground after water taps are damaged. Source: Facebook / Tash Hughes\n\n\"They're perishing because of no water,\" he said.\n\n\"No matter what amount of pulling and tugging, we are not always successfully getting them out alive. They're stuck in the mud and it's very dangerous. They'll swing their head around, they'll give you a good old bite, they can damage you.\n\n\"Camel populations are not going to disappear and hopefully there's a business opportunity for somebody, but you can't create a business opportunity when the crisis starts. You need to do that well before.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "Elena Rybakina has upstaged two-time champion Aryna Sabalenka to shed her tag as a one-slam wonder with a high-octane Australian Open final triumph in Melbourne.\n\nAvenging her lost to the Belarusian in the 2023 title decider, Rybakina roared from a service break down in the deciding set to deny Sabalenka in three sets on Saturday night to add the Open crown to her 2022 Wimbledon trophy.\n\nThe fighting victory completed a rare golden double after the big-hitting Kazakh also defeated the top-ranked Sabalenka in last year's prestigious season-ending championship in Saudi Arabia.\n\nAfter taking out world No.2 Iga Swiatek and the sixth-ranked Jessica Pegula on her charge to the final, Rybakina is the first woman since Naomi Osaka in 2019 to claim the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup with three consecutive wins over top-10 rivals.\n\nRunner up Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus holds her trophy after losing the women\u2019s singles final against Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan. Source: AAP / Joel Carrett\n\nWith rain hitting Melbourne for the first time all tournament, the match was played under a closed roof on Rod Laver Arena, creating perfect indoor conditions for the women's game's two heaviest hitters.\n\nSabalenka and Rybakina were the first duo to joust for the title after contesting the season-ending final showpiece since Martina Hingis beat Lindsay Davenport in 1999.\n\nThe championship climax shaped as an intriguing showdown, with neither powerhouse combatant dropping a set en route to the final and Sabalenka shading their head-to-head record 8-6 and boasting a phenomenal 26 wins from her past 27 matches at the Open.\n\nBut the queen of Melbourne Park was taking on a fearsome foe who had won 19 of her past 20 matches herself and, among active players, only veteran former world No.1 Venus Williams boasts more wins over Sabalenka than Rybakina.\n\nUnder seige\n\nAnd the world No.1 was quickly under siege.\n\nWith booming groundstrokes, fifth-seeded Rybakina broke Sabalenka in the opening game of the match, then held to love in a clear early statement.\n\nRybakina was in trouble at 15-40 in the eighth game but fired down four huge serves to hold for 5-3 before coolly closing out the set.\n\nThe first woman since Hingis in 2002 to appear in at least four straight AO finals, Sabalenka had several opportunities to hit back early in the second set but squandered three break points in a 10-minute second game.\n\nSabalenka finally nabbed her first break of the match with Rybakina serving to stay in the second set at 4-5, the top seed levelling the contest after an hour and 25 minutes.\n\nFittingly, the first two women to clash in the final without having lost a set in the tournament since Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin in 2008 headed into a decider.\n\nSabalenka appeared on course for victory after surging to a 3-0 lead, only to dump a backhand into the net to allow Rybakina back on serve.\n\nThe lapse led to the world No.1 mentally unravelling as the Kazakh reeled off four straight games and sealed victory with an ace on her first match point after two hours and 18 minutes.\n\nWhile the 26-year-old rejoiced in becoming a dual grand slam champion, Sabalenka was left to digest suffering back-to-back finals defeats after also losing last year's title decider to Madison Keys.\n\nAs well as walking off with the trophy, Rybakina pocketed a monster cheque for $4.15 million and can look forward to a rankings rise to world No.3 on Monday.\n\nNo luck for Aussie doubles pair\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the Australian pair, Jason Kubler and Marc Polmans lost the Australian Open men's doubles final.\n\nKubler, partnering with fellow Australian Marc Polmans as plucky wildcards, went down against sixth seeds Christian Harrison and Neal Skupski in two sets in Saturday's tournament decider.\n\nBetter luck next time for Australian Open men's doubles runner-up, homegrown heroes Jason Kubler and Marc Polmans. Source: AAP / Joel Carrett\n\nBecoming the fifth British man to win multiple major doubles titles, former No.1 Skupski defied nerves to serve out the match.\n\nIt ends an unforgettable fortnight for newly engaged pair Kubler and Inglis, who between them have pocketed a life-changing $902,350.\n\nIf Kubler and Polmans had won the doubles final, that figure would have ballooned to a combined $1.27 million.\n\nKubler was vying for his second Australian Open men's doubles crown after teaming up with Rinky Hijikata to win the 2023 final.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "The Manuellas are one of the first families to arrive in Australia under a new treaty with Tuvalu, as rising sea levels threaten their homeland.\n\nHailed as a global first, each year 280 people from the Pacific Island nation can now relocate to Australia thanks to a special visa program, created under the terms of the Falepili Union treaty between the two countries.\n\nThe visa was partially designed to assist those on the front-line of climate change and rising sea levels.\n\nHowever, with a small Tuvaluan diaspora here, those like the Manuella family will face challenges to settle while maintaining a connection to their community and culture.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Telieta and Kaumaile arrived in Melbourne with their four children.\n\nLISTEN TO First cohort of migrants under Tuvalu deal arrive in Australia SBS News 05:48 English\n\n\"It\u2019s a new home and it\u2019s a new journey ... Tuvalu will always be in our heart and our home, but Australia is another new chapter to our family journey,\" Telieta said.\n\nShe worked for Tuvalu's department of labour, while her husband Kaumaile was in the government's public works department with a background in architecture.\n\nThe couple are among the more than 8,700 people to apply for the Falepili Mobility Pathway visa, which grants permanent residency to those chosen.\n\n\"We came to the conclusion that in case we were selected, it would be a good opportunity in terms of better life, better education for our children, better job opportunities,\" Telieta said.\n\nThe prospect of being chosen was a one in more than 30 chance.\n\nREAD MORE Why over a third of this nation's citizens want to migrate to Australia\n\nKaumaile recalled the moment he heard the news that his family had been successful.\n\n\"It was funny, I was in the shower and then came out of the room, and my wife was on the phone. I saw her face was like changing, it was like surprised. So I said 'oh, what happened?' and I thought something happened to her family or relative. But actually she just told me that we got an email saying that we'd been selected.\"\n\nPermanent residency granted\n\nProfessor Jane McAdam, director of the University of New South Wales' Evacuations Research Hub, explains the visa doesn't require applicants to have work or study plans already arranged.\n\n\"It provides opportunities for what we call livelihood diversification, it enables kids to go to school in Australia, for people to acquire further skills and training which they might want to use here, but equally might want to take back to Tuvalu,\" McAdam told SBS News.\n\n\"I think that's why this is something that the Tuvaluan government actually requested from Australia, because it sees it as embedding that skills diversification, that broader opportunity for remittances to be sent back to Tuvalu to support the economy there, rather than this being a one-way street for people to leave Tuvalu.\"\n\nThe Tuvaluan diaspora in Melbourne is small but tight-knit, and the Manuellas consider themselves lucky to be staying with their relative, Niuelesolo Boland, who is deeply involved with the community.\n\nBoland believes the government could do more to help new arrivals settle in Australia.\n\n\"I think it's falling back on the Tuvaluan diaspora in Australia to pick up the burden,\" he said.\n\n\"Like a lot of them are looking at forms like 'what is this?' you know? Coming from Tuvalu, where we don't even have tax file numbers, you know? Or a Medicare scheme. So to them it's totally foreign.\"\n\nIs random selection a concern?\n\nWhile the Falepili Mobility Pathway has proven hugely popular in Tuvalu, some experts have taken issue with the random nature of the visa ballot system.\n\nDr Yvonne Su, from Harvard University's School of Public Health, points out that the visa was partially designed to assist those on the front-line of climate change and rising sea levels.\n\n\"Climate change is not random. Climate change doesn't just happen to anybody, unfortunately,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\"So, because climate change is not by chance, it frightens me that we've allowed the people on this visa, that I have to say has been branded with climate change resilience as a big part of it, and saying climate mobility and saying you're protecting them from climate change as a big part of it, you're saying that could be by chance.\"\n\nFederal Minister for Pacific Affairs, Pat Conroy, said the random selection of the ballot was critical to ensure Tuvalu avoided brain drain, the large-scale emigration of highly skilled and educated individuals.\n\n\"If you didn't have a ballot system that introduced an element of random selection, in the end the people who would qualify first for this visa would be the people with the highest educational and professional qualifications within Tuvalu, and that would lead to a brain drain,\" he said.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

Behind the giant curved-class exterior on the second level, golden carpets lead to long, black bars where theatre-goers will order drinks in little plastic cups. Inside, 1500 \u201crainforest green\u201d seats stretch in front of a wide stage. The room feels intimate despite the scale of the building, which required more than 6300 cubic metres of concrete and 1500 tonnes of steel, along with all that glass. The visually stunning building was four years behind schedule.

Backstage, 79 mirror spaces mean the theatre can easily accommodate larger performances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to architect Jayson Blight, who gave a tour to media on Monday, the mission of the building was to blend into the existing centre, not cast a shadow over it. He also said the complex structure of the 217 undulating panes meant they supported themselves. On stage at The Glasshouse. Julius Dennis \u201cThere is actually no structure holding up that glass,\u201d he told the crowd, some of whom laughing nervously. Named The Glasshouse after a public survey to choose a moniker, the theatre was meant to open its doors in 2022, but flooding and COVID-19 pushed it back four years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Arts Minister John-Paul Langbroek said there was no cost blowout to match, thanks to a $184 million guaranteed construction sum contract with the builder, Lendlease. The Queensland Performing Arts Centre contributed $25 million, with the rest provided by the state, he said. The level foyer behind the bending glass. Julius Dennis \u201cIt certainly has taken a long time, but it\u2019s really important to acknowledge that we\u2019re here now, and it\u2019s a wonderful theatre,\u201d Langbroek said.

Despite that dig, both ministers thanked the more than 2500 workers who brought the theatre to life. \u201cThey should all be proud of their efforts to produce what is truly one of the most beautiful buildings in our state,\u201d O\u2019Connor said.

Wall Street had an unsteady session on Friday. AP The S&P/ASX 200 was down 81.5 points or 0.9 per cent at 8787.6 in early trading, with six of 11 industry sectors lower. The Australian dollar lost ground as the US dollar rallied following President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh to be the next Federal Reserve chair. The Aussie was trading at US69.57\u00a2 at 12.33pm AEDT. Also on the agenda for local investors is the Reserve Bank\u2019s interest rates decision on Tuesday, with markets expecting the central bank to unveil its first rise in more than two years. In early trade, precious metal miners were battered with gold giants Northern Star (down 7.9 per cent), Evolution Mining (down 6.3 per cent) and Newmont (down 8.4 per cent) tumbling. Silver players also fell sharply with South32 losing 4.2 per cent. The falls came after the price of gold dropped 11.4 per cent to settle at $US4745.10 per ounce on Saturday. Gold\u2019s price suddenly lost momentum following a tremendous rally where it roughly doubled over 12 months. It topped $US5000 for the first time last week and was trading at around $US5600 at one point. Silver, which had been on a similar, jaw-dropping tear, fell even more. It plunged 31.4 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article US politics Trump taps former Federal Reserve insider to replace Powell \u201cThe total collapse in precious metals prices shows that any market can become gripped by mania,\u201d Kyle Rodda, a senior analyst at Capital.com, wrote in a note. \u201cGiven the build-up of positioning and leverage involved, the sell-off is bleeding into other markets. Effectively, a deleveraging is happening.\u201d Other mining stocks retreated. BHP lost 2 per cent, Rio Tinto fell 0.4 per cent and Fortescue dipped 0.1 per cent. Financial stocks are mixed, having shed some of their early gains. Commonwealth Bank led the way with a 1 per cent gain, while ANZ Bank added 0.8 per cent and Westpac advanced 0.6 per cent, but National Australia Bank fell 0.5 per cent. Energy stocks slid as oil prices retreated. Woodside Energy lost 0.8 per cent, Santos shed 2.2 per cent and Ampol dipped 0.1 per cent in early afternoon trade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsewhere, the founder and managing director of the embattled Corporate Travel Management, Jamie Pherous, is stepping down with immediate effect, months after trading in its shares was halted and following a scandal over alleged over-charging of government clients. Over the weekend, financial markets churned as investors tried to figure out what Trump\u2019s new nominee to lead the Federal Reserve would mean for interest rates. US stocks fell, with the S&P 500 down 0.4 per cent after sinking as much as 1.1 per cent earlier in the day. The Dow Jones dropped 179 points, or 0.4 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.9 per cent. Whoever leads the Fed has a big influence on the economy and markets worldwide by helping to dictate where the US central bank moves interest rates. Such decisions lift or weigh on prices for all kinds of investments, as the Fed tries to keep the US job market humming without letting inflation get out of control. Trump has been pushing for lower interest rates, which usually help goose the economy but can also cause higher inflation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe longtime assumption has been that the Fed should operate separately from the rest of Washington so that it can make moves that are painful in the short term but necessary for the long term. To get inflation down to the Fed\u2019s goal of 2 per cent, for example, may require the unpopular choice to keep interest rates high and grind down on the economy for a while. Kevin Warsh has been a supporter of lowering interest rates. Bloomberg The big question is what Warsh\u2019s nomination, which still requires approval from the Senate, means for the Fed\u2019s independence. Warsh used to be a governor on the Fed\u2019s board, so investors are familiar with him. That could also mean Warsh is familiar with and hopes to continue the institution of the Fed as an independent operator. And while with the Fed, Warsh criticised the central bank\u2019s buying of bonds to keep interest rates low. Some on Wall Street took Warsh\u2019s nomination as an encouraging signal for a still-independent Fed that will keep rates high, if necessary. Besides slowing the economy, higher interest rates would push downward on stock prices.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Warsh has also recently been critical of the Fed\u2019s current chair, Jerome Powell, and has voiced support for lower rates. Helping to limit the market\u2019s losses was Tesla, which rose 3.3 per cent. It bounced back after dropping on Thursday despite delivering better profit reports for the latest quarter than analysts expected.

Got it Share A A A\n\nDalaroo Metals has moved a step closer to de-risking its Blue Lagoon critical minerals project in southern Greenland after confirming the discovery of a zircon-dominated heavy mineral system, just as Western governments are scrambling to secure alternative supply chains outside China. Geochemical analysis results from surface and shallow auger sampling obtained during the company\u2019s maiden 2025 field program have landed in Dalaroo\u2019s inbox, and have confirmed a strong, consistent correlation between zirconium and hafnium - a textbook signature of zircon-hosted mineralisation. Lagoon and shoreline sediments at Dalaroo Metals\u2019 Blue Lagoon critical minerals project in south-west Greenland. The tight relationship suggests the heavy minerals are being naturally concentrated within lagoonal and shoreline sediments, pointing to a laterally continuous system that has already been upgraded by nature through mechanical processes. Dalaroo believes natural sedimentary and hydraulic processes have done much of the beneficiation work upfront. Wave action and shoreline sorting have concentrated dense, chemically resistant minerals into near-surface traps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018These results represent an important step in systematically de-risking the Blue Lagoon project.\u2019 Dalaroo Metals chief executive officer John Morgan The strong zirconium\u2013hafnium correlation also delivers a practical exploration advantage. The zirconium mineralisation is proving to be a practical pathfinder element, enabling handheld X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) surveys for rapid, real-time targeting in the field. This geological simplicity could be the key to future development. Heavy mineral sands systems are typically shallow, flat-lying and amenable to straightforward gravity separation. These factors can lead to shorter, cheaper development timelines, coupled with reduced technical risk compared to many hard-rock critical minerals projects. Notably, the zirconium\u2013hafnium relationship shows up across multiple sample types and locations, supporting the company\u2019s view of a broad, sedimentary heavy mineral system rather than isolated or structurally controlled occurrences - a level of consistency that materially de-risks the project at an early stage. Recent surface samples have thrown up 0.81 per cent total rare earth oxides (TREO), alongside consistently high-grade zirconium oxide reaching up to 4.42 per cent. The project has also returned substantial hafnium grades up to 99 parts per million (ppm) hafnium oxide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe project was secured by Dalaroo Metals Limited just a month ago and its initial work \u2014 the first systematic exploration since the late 1970s \u2014 has outlined a 2.7km strike zone with standout critical mineral grades, pointing to a potential district-scale rare earth elements and zirconium discovery. Zirconium and hafnium are both listed as critical minerals due to their roles in advanced manufacturing, aerospace, defence technologies and nuclear applications. Hafnium, in particular, is prized for its use in semiconductors, nuclear control rods and high-temperature alloys, and currently trades at a whopping AU$17,000 per kilogram. Zirconium, meanwhile, is essential in ceramics, refractories and nuclear fuel cladding. Blue Lagoon also holds a promising rare earths inventory, dominated by the prized elements dysprosium and terbium - critical for the manufacturing of strong, permanent magnets used in electric vehicle motors, wind turbine generators, and other renewable technologies. Crucially, uranium and thorium analyses have remained low and are well below Greenland\u2019s mandated 100ppm threshold, smoothing the regulatory path to any future development. Greenland has emerged as a focal point for Western critical minerals strategy, sitting within NATO territory and increasingly viewed as a stable, transparent jurisdiction capable of supplying zirconium, hafnium and rare earth elements into allied markets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDalaroo\u2019s wholly owned Blue Lagoon project sits in the south-west corner of Greenland, well below the Arctic Circle and within the Gardar Alkaline Province, which is a globally recognised belt prospective for zirconium, niobium, hafnium and rare earth elements. Dalaroo Metals chief executive officer John Morgan said: \u201cThese results represent an important step in systematically de-risking the Blue Lagoon project. Confirming zircon as the dominant host mineral provides confidence that heavy mineral concentrations are laterally continuous and potentially amenable to simple gravity processing methods. Heavy mineral systems globally are typically associated with shallow mining, low strip ratios and straightforward beneficiation flowsheets.\u201d Next up, Dalaroo plans to bring in specialist consultants to run detailed mineralogical, metallurgical and process characterisation test work. The program will include heavy mineral separation, automated mineralogical microanalysis (QEMSCAN) and gravity recovery testing. Expanded shoreline sampling, handheld XRF mapping and additional shallow drilling are also on the to-do list. With critical minerals now front-and-centre in Western industrial and defence policy and Greenland firmly in the geopolitical spotlight, Dalaroo\u2019s Blue Lagoon project appears to be shaping up as a strategically located, technically simple and potentially scalable source of minerals the world is increasingly desperate to secure.

        "text": "The notorious pedophile who abused former Australian of the Year Grace Tame when she was a student will likely be declared unfit to face trial on harassment charges.\n\nNicolaas Ockert Bester, a former teacher at Hobart private schools, was found guilty of sexually abusing Ms Tame - later named Australian of the Year - when she was his student in 2011.\n\nHe was also convicted over child exploitation material in 2016 and in 2022 was accused of three counts of using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe former teacher allegedly made public posts on social media about and directed at Ms Tame in April, July and August of 2022.\n\nBester's deteriorating health, delays to health assessments and the slow-moving court system has delayed the matter for over three years.\n\nOn Monday, the frail 73-year-old returned to Hobart Magistrates Court, arriving and leaving with the help of a walking frame.\n\nBoth his lawyers and prosecutors agreed there was insufficient evidence to show Bester was fit to stand trial, and that his health was unlikely to improve.\n\nLa Trobe University professor Simon Crowe, enlisted to provide assessments of the abuser's condition, told the court he was previously a \"high-functioning individual\".\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHowever, he had suffered at least three strokes, a number of falls, a brain clot and other issues in recent months.\n\nFormer Australian of the Year Grace Tame was allegedly subjected to social media harassment in 2022. (Ethan James/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"Mr Bester has vascular dementia in my view as a consequence of the cumulative effect of the ... strokes as well as the falls,\" Prof Crowe told the court under questioning from prosecutor Ruth Champion.\n\n\"The likelihood that he could ever come back from this very profound set of brain-impacting events is very, very low indeed.\"\n\nBester's lawyer Todd Kovacic told the court his client was \"not really following\" proceedings.\n\nMagistrate Andrew McKee deferred the matter to February 24, which he said would be \"formalising what I think we all know is going to occur\".\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile his condition means he is unlikely to have to enter pleas or face trial, the matter is still listed to proceed with a further directions hearing listed for April 8.\n\nNicolaas Bester had two further court dates set despite being unlikely to plead or face trial. (Ben McKay/AAP PHOTOS)\n\nIf the charges are proved beyond reasonable doubt, the magistrate could still impose punishments, such as restraining orders.\n\nBester was released from prison in 2013 after serving one year and nine months for grooming and abusing Ms Tame, then 15, while a teacher at St Michael's Collegiate school.\n\nPrior to his 2022 charges, the 2021 Australian of the Year called out Bester's alleged public and private online harassment on the X social media platform.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"This has been the reality for 12 years now, behind closed doors for my family and me,\" Ms Tame said.\n\nBester, who previously managed The Hutchins School boarding house, also studied for a PhD at the University of Tasmania after his jail term.\n\n1800 RESPECT (1800 737 732)\n\nNational Sexual Abuse and Redress Support Service 1800 211 028",
