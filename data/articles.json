        "text": "In a country that ranks poorly internationally for gender equality, the new president of Japan's long-governing Liberal Democrats, and likely next prime minister, is an ultra-conservative star of a male-dominated party that critics call an obstacle to women's advancement.\n\nSanae Takaichi, 64, admires former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and is a proponent of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's conservative vision for Japan.\n\nTakaichi is the first female president of Japan's predominantly male ruling party that has dominated Japan's postwar politics almost without interruption.\n\nSanae Takaichi, the newly-elected leader of Japan's ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). (AP)\n\nShe hardly touched on gender issues during the campaign, but on Saturday, as she tried out the party president's chair and posed for a photo as is customary for the newly elected leader, Takaichi said: \"Now that the LDP has its first female president, its scenery will change a little.\"\n\nFirst elected to parliament from her hometown of Nara in 1993, she has served in key party and government posts, including minister of economic security, internal affairs and gender equality.\n\nFemale lawmakers in the conservative Liberal Democratic Party who were given limited ministerial posts have often been shunned as soon as they spoke up about diversity and gender equality. Takaichi has stuck with old-fashioned views favoured by male party heavyweights.\n\nTakaichi celebrates with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba after winning the LDP leadership election. (Getty)\n\nTakaichi also admits she is a workaholic who would rather study at home instead of socialising. After unsuccessfully running for party presidency twice in the past, she made efforts to be more sociable to build connections as advised, she said.\n\nBut on Saturday, as she called for an all-out effort to rebuild the party and regain public support, she asked all party lawmakers to \"work like a horse.\" Then she added, \"I will abandon the word 'work-life balance.' I will work, work, work and work.\"\n\nThe \"work-life balance\" quickly trended on social media, triggering mixed reactions \u2013 support for her enthusiasm and concern about her work ethic.\n\nJapan's politics are largely male-dominated. (AP)\n\nWomen comprise only about 15 per cent of Japan's lower house, the more powerful of the two parliamentary chambers. Only two of Japan's 47 prefectural governors are women.\n\nA drummer in a heavy-metal band and a motorbike rider as a student, Takaichi has called for a stronger military, more fiscal spending for growth, promotion of nuclear fusion, cybersecurity and tougher policies on immigration.\n\nShe vowed to drastically increase female ministers in her government. But experts say she might actually set back women's advancement because as leader she would have to show loyalty to influential male heavyweights. If not, she risks a short-lived leadership.\n\nTakaichi has backed financial support for women's health and fertility treatment as part of the LDP policy of having women serve in their traditional roles of being good mothers and wives. But she also recently acknowledged her struggles with menopausal symptoms and stressed the need to educate men about female health to help women at school and work.\n\nTakaichi supports the imperial family's male-only succession, opposes same-sex marriage and a revision to the 19th-century civil law that would allow separate surnames for married couples so that women don't get pressured into abandoning theirs.\n\nShe is a wartime history revisionist and China hawk. She regularly visits Yasukuni Shrine, which Japan's neighbours consider a symbol of militarism, though she has declined to say what she would do as prime minister.\n\nPolitical watchers say her revisionist views of Japan's wartime history may complicate ties with Beijing and Seoul.\n\nHer hawkish stance is also a worry for the LDP's longtime partnership with Komeito, a Buddhist-backed moderate party. While she has said the current coalition is crucial for her party, she says she is open to working with far-right groups.",

        "text": "How did a tropical reptile, only slightly bigger than a dinner plate, end up on Western Australia's south coast hundreds of kilometres from home?\n\nThat's what wildlife carers have asked after a juvenile green turtle, in poor condition, washed up on a beach in Esperance, 800 kilometres south-east of Perth, last week.\n\nThe juvenile sea turtle was found in poor condition at Wylie Bay, a popular beach just east of Esperance. (Supplied: Lori-Ann Shibish)\n\nThe unlikely traveller, usually found in the warm waters along the north-west of WA, had a large gash above its front flipper, was sluggish and had what appeared to be an eye infection.\n\nRush to help\n\nThe injured animal was quickly transferred to the nearby Esperance Wildlife Hospital by a young family who found it washed ashore at Wylie Bay, about 10km east of town.\n\nHospital co-founder Lori-Ann Shibish said the initial treatment over several days was done alongside Dr Alex Hockton under the advice of Perth Zoo veterinary staff.\n\nLori-Ann Shibish says she was surprised a tropical sea turtle was found this far south. (ABC Esperance: Andrew Williams)\n\n\"It had a huge gash on the top of its right flipper. It was cut right open and you could see the muscle,\" she said.\n\n\"And the last issue it had was when we put it in the water, it was floating, so it could not dive, which indicated it somehow had air trapped in its shell.\"\n\nMs Shibish said a plan was then hatched to transport the turtle to Perth for more specialist care, with a call put out on social media for any potential volunteers to make the drive.\n\nJade Sing agreed to help and was dubbed the \"turtle taxi\".\n\nJade Sing volunteered to transport the injured turtle 800km to Perth. (Supplied: Lori-Ann Shibish)\n\nIt takes a village\n\nWA Wildlife Hospital chief executive Dean Huxley said the turtle was in poor condition on arrival.\n\n\"When it came to us, it was very lethargic and quite weak,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to the large wound on its front flipper, it appeared to have had a run-in with a predator in the past.\n\nThe green turtle had a large gash across one of its front flippers. (Supplied: WA Wildlife Hospital)\n\n\"Its back flippers had sustained an old injury \u2026 so at some point it's been attacked, potentially by a shark,\" Mr Huxley said.\n\n\"Both of its back flippers were pretty much bitten in half, so it really only has the use of its two front flippers.\"\n\nFortunately, the turtle is on the road to recovery, and Mr Huxley said it could not have been done without help from the community.\n\nDean Huxley says saving the turtle would not have been possible without the community coming together. (Supplied: WA Wildlife Hospital)\n\n\"This is a really good example of the whole community working together. There were a lot of different groups involved in this turtle's rescue,\" he said.\n\n\"It just goes to show that no one group can do all this, and it really does take a village.\"\n\nMr Huxley said the turtle would remain under the hospital's care until it fully recovered and would then be transported back to its natural habitat.\n\nThe WA Wildlife Hospital has cared for the young turtle since it arrived in Perth. (Supplied: WA Wildlife Hospital)\n\n\"It's going to have to be flown back up north so that it can be released back into its normal area,\" he said.\n\n\"Probably somewhere near Broome or Port Hedland.\"\n\nNot the first vagrant\n\nThe green turtle is not the first \"vagrant\" to have been found in the waters near Esperance in the last few years.\n\nIn January 2023, a westland petrel was found at Wylie Bay, the first time the species had ever been recorded in WA.\n\nThe green turtle was found by a young family at Wylie Bay, just east of Esperance. (ABC Esperance: Andrew Williams)\n\nThen, just months later, three Fiordland crested penguins, one of the world's rarest species of penguin, were found along the Esperance coastline.\n\nThe penguins are normally found along the south-western tip of New Zealand's South Island, almost 4,000km away.\n\nIn 2023, Lori-Ann Shibish helped nurse three Fiordland crested penguins back to health. (ABC Esperance: Emily Smith)\n\n\"A lot of these animals show up and they're very malnourished and in poor physical condition,\" Ms Shibish said.\n\n\"There is something happening in the lives of these animals which is causing them to move further away from their normal habitats.\n\n\" We're just not sure what that is. \"\n\nUncommon but not unheard of\n\nMurdoch University researcher Jenna Hounslow is a movement ecologist who studies where animals move and why.\n\nShe said while the juvenile green turtles' appearance in the state's south coast waters was not the norm, it was not unheard of.\n\nJenna Hounslow says green turtles rarely travel further south than Shark Bay. (Supplied: Jenna Hounslow)\n\n\"This is definitely outside of their southerly range limit [Shark Bay],\" Dr Hounslow said.\n\n\"Any further south and the water would be getting a bit cold for them.\"\n\nShe said there could be many reasons as to why the reptile ranged so far south.\n\n\"It may have been caught on the warm water Leeuwin current, which runs north to south down the west coast,\" she said.\n\n\"And it could also be related to the marine heatwave that WA has been experiencing since this time last year.\"",

(Supplied: Orange-bellied Parrot Program)\n\n'No-go zones' should be in environmental reforms\n\nSenator Waters said the renewables rollout should be accelerated with long-awaited reforms to environmental laws.\n\nLabor tried to pass those reforms in the last term, balancing the concerns of environmental groups and businesses who say major projects take too long to obtain a \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nEfforts have been renewed under Murray Watt and appear closer to success, but the government has not detailed any changes to the proposal that failed to pass in the last parliament.\n\nThe Greens want the environment minister to be required by law to consider the impacts of major infrastructure projects on climate change, viewing renewables projects more favourably and effectively preventing new fossil fuel projects.\n\n\"That will continue to be a core demand of ours. You can't have environmental laws that don't protect the environment or think about the climate impacts of what we do,\" she said.\n\nSenator Waters said the government should end native forest logging and should ensure its environmental laws designate \"no-go zones\" where applications are not considered, citing the Bowen Basin.\n\nThe Greens leader did not endorse the Climate Change Authority's advice that wind power should quadruple by 2035 in alignment with its recommended emissions reduction goal of 62 to 70 per cent on 2005 levels.\n\n\"I support quadrupling renewable energy. I have an open mind as to what particular technology will be the most efficient,\" she said, adding Labor's climate target was \"pathetic\" and \"will imperil us all\".",

(Supplied)\n\nAt first glance, the latest hepatitis B data for the Northern Territory appears to paint a grim picture.\n\nThe figures provided by NT Health, which only cover the first six months of each year, show diagnoses almost tripled between 2022 and 2024.\n\nBut rather than being a cause for concern, healthcare workers say it's actually a sign the Northern Territory is leading the nation in terms of care for the viral infection.\n\nGeorge Gurruwiwi says prevention efforts are working in his home community of Galiwin'ku. (Supplied)\n\nMr Gurruwiwi says he has seen the change firsthand, having noticed fewer hepatitis B deaths in his community in recent years.\n\nSince 2019, he has been a key partner with NT hepatitis B prevention program HEP B PAST, working to improve access to testing and treatment in Arnhem Land as both a community liaison and researcher.\n\n\"I mentor through a cultural perspective, through kinship,\" he said.\n\n\"The difference is people understand.\"\n\nFalling morality rates\n\nSeventy per cent of people who have hepatitis B in the Northern Territory are Indigenous, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Viral Hepatitis.\n\nLandmark hepatitis study tracks ancient human movements Photo shows footprints in the desert In what they believe is an Australian first, researchers have used a unique strain of hepatitis B virus to deduce ancient human population movements into Australia.\n\nThe territory is also home to an aggressive strain of hepatitis B called C4, which has only ever been diagnosed in Aboriginal people, and particularly Aboriginal people in the NT.\n\nHepatitis B can lead to severe liver degradation, and liver cancer in some cases if left untreated.\n\nWhile non-chronic infections can be cured, most NT cases are chronic, and can be treated \u2014 though not cured \u2014 through regular check-ups to monitor liver function.\n\nAnngie Everitt, a nurse who runs a hepatitis clinic in Darwin, said the main way hepatitis B was transmitted in the NT was from mother to child, during birth.\n\n\"It's babies, it's people that either contract from birth, or at a really young age, that are most likely to develop chronic hepatitis B, which requires lifelong treatment,\" she said.\n\nAnngie Everitt runs a Darwin clinic for all types of hepatitis. (ABC News: Tilda Colling)\n\nMr Gurruwiwi said often people did not even realise they had the infection until they developed serious liver problems.\n\n\"Young people, especially, they don't notice it in their bodies,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of them \u2026 I've seen it, they passed [away].\"\n\nThe HEP B PAST program includes an app that distributes information about hepatitis B in multiple Indigenous languages. (Supplied)\n\nBut health workers say the tide is turning.\n\nAccording to WHO research, since 2011, the Northern Territory has recorded the biggest decrease in hepatitis B mortality rates of any Australian state or territory.\n\nMenzies School of Health Research Professor Jane Davies runs the HEP B PAST program in the Northern Territory, which has been nationally recognised as leading the nation in hepatitis B reduction.\n\nThe success of the HEP B PAST program, pioneered by Jane Davies, has been acknowledged by Australia's national hepatitis B strategy. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nHaving started in 2018, the program visits remote Aboriginal communities to deliver a \"one stop liver shop\", providing all the care needed for hepatitis B diagnosis and surveillance \u2014 like bloods and ultrasounds \u2014 in one day.\n\nIt also offers an app that translates healthcare information into 11 different Indigenous languages.\n\n\"You can imagine being told you have this chronic condition, that you could get liver cancer, that you need care every six months \u2014 that can be really scary, [and] that can be even scarier if it's not in your first language,\" Professor Davies said.\n\nThe program provides key hepatitis care, including blood tests, in a single day. (ABC News)\n\nThe HEP B PAST program has been recognised at a national level for its groundbreaking work, and has been recommended in national strategies as a successful model that could be rolled out in other jurisdictions to help eradicate hepatitis B in Australia.\n\nProfessor Davies said the improvement in the data indicated the Northern Territory had actually closed the gap in hepatitis care.\n\nThe HEP B PAST program has partnered with Aboriginal health organisations and traditional owners across the Northern Territory. (Supplied)\n\n\"Ten years ago we definitely were not meeting national strategy targets for people being diagnosed, for them being engaged in care and for them being on treatment \u2026 [but] very recently we're able to say we're achieving the national strategy targets,\" she said.\n\n\"That means that we have 99 per cent of people diagnosed \u2026 and the national target is 80 per cent.\n\n\"We have 86 per cent of people engaged in care and the national target is 50 per cent, and we have 24 per cent of people on treatment and the national target is 20 per cent.

Kick-off times, pre-game entertainment and all the players taking the field. Here's everything you need to know for grand final day in Sydney.\n\nNo club has played in more grand finals in the NRL era, with Melbourne's 12 four clear of the next best, the Sydney Roosters.\n\nSunday's decider against Brisbane will also mark Craig Bellamy's 11th as coach, taking him past Wayne Bennett for the most in history.\n\nAnd on joining the Storm in 2017, Hughes immediately saw what made them the winning machine he once envied.\n\n\"I've got a lot of respect for Craig and what he's done,\" Hughes said.\n\n\"I know he's a big reason for it, just what he brings to the club, and how hard he works. He demands that from his players, and his staff as well.\"\n\nHughes is not alone.\n\n\"Because they're so successful, I think it's hard to like the Storm when you're a fan of another team,\" prop Josh King said.\n\n\"I certainly never hated them that much that I was actively cursing them or anything.\n\n\"But when you're a young fella and probably don't understand much about footy, it's easy to dislike a team that wins all the time.\n\n\"Once I started to play professionally and tried to better myself, that's when the Storm became really intriguing to me.\"\n\nFor others, there were obvious reasons to like the Storm.\n\nHarry Grant says he always had respect for the Storm and its Queensland contingent.

(ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nSeven years ago, the pair stumbled upon a 15-centimetre bronze Buddha, buried beneath 20cm of topsoil near a roadside.\n\n\"When I first lifted the statue from the ground, its weight struck me, and as I turned it over in the late afternoon sun, the worn gold shimmered,\" Mr Thompson said.\n\nThe discovery has seen them spend considerable time and money investigating theories about how the small statue came to rest in the red dirt of the WA's north.\n\nLeon Deschamps says, to his knowledge, no-one has returned to the site where the Baby Buddha was discovered to see what else might lie beneath the sands. (ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\n\"However it got here, it was carried by someone who held it sacred and potentially who had it in their family for centuries prior to that,\" Mr Deschamps said.\n\n\" It's four or 500 years old, it's only been buried for the last couple of hundred. \"\n\nShayne Thompson at the 2025 Perth Multicultural Festival. (Supplied: Shayne Thompson)\n\nA seven-year mystery\n\nAfter finding the Buddha, the pair were convinced it was from a Ming \"treasure\" ship, large wooden vessels that sailed from China in the 15th century.\n\nDespite their efforts, including engaging a television shipwreck hunter program, the theory has never been proven.\n\nThe bronze Buddha has a chocolate-brown patina, with worn gilding that glows gold under sunlight. (Supplied: Shayne Thompson)\n\nIan MacLeod of the West Australian Museum identified that the Buddha was buried between 100 and 150 years ago, and it was verified as from the Ming Dynasty by Asian art expert Lee Young.\n\nMr Thompson said Ming Dynasty Buddhas were typically made of gilt bronze using the lost-wax casting method.\n\n\"This process involves creating a wax model of the statue, enclosing it in a clay mould, melting the wax to create a cavity, and then pouring molten bronze into the cavity,\" he said.\n\nFrom the red sands of Shark Bay, the finders hope Baby Buddha will one day return to its homeland in China. (Supplied: Shayne Thompson)\n\n\"After the metal cools, the mould is broken away, and the bronze casting is then finished with gilding, which applies a thin layer of gold to the surface.\n\n\"Once a year, on Buddha's birthday, devotees pour water over the statue's shoulders while reciting three mantras: do good deeds, speak good words, and think good thoughts.\"\n\nMr Deschamps believed the sands of Shark Bay kept many secrets of the past.\n\n\"We're still not sure what lies beneath where we found the Buddha, we'd love to see an archaeological dig at the location,\" he said.\n\nPearls of history\n\nThe pearling lugger Galli-Cuci (also known as \"The Galla\"), once used in the pearling industry by Dennis Holt\u2019s father. (Supplied: Dennis Holt)\n\nA more commonly accepted theory is the Buddha belonged to one of the early pearlers in the Shark Bay region.\n\nOnce only accessible by ship, Shark Bay was the birthplace of Western Australia's pearling industry in the 1850s, driven by demand for pearl shell to make buttons.\n\nPearlers used Malay, Chinese and Aboriginal people as labourers, but eventually Chinese-owned pearling operations established their own camps in the region.\n\nToday a popular tourist destination, the town of Denham was once a thriving fishing community. (Supplied: Dennis Holt and ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nAccording to the WA Museum, a 1886 census counted 200 people involved in the Shark Bay pearl fishery consisting of 60 Europeans, 102 Chinese and 68 Malays, with the Chinese controlling seven of the 68 vessels in the Bay.\n\nBut the population then dwindled later that year, after the government restricted the number of pearling leases Chinese people could buy, leading to a tense stand-off with armed police.\n\nMr Deschamps said this history should be recognised.\n\n\"In Broome, you see the Japanese pearling industry acknowledged and honoured, and it's a massive part of their tourism industry, we want that for Shark Bay,\" he said.\n\n\"So part of what we'd really like to see is a [Chinese] memorial of some description, we'd love to see a Buddhist peace memorial.\"\n\nRed sands and tidal waters, the locals often refer Shark Bay to where the desert meets the sea. (ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nAn act of diplomacy\n\nMr Deschamps wants Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to give the infant Buddha statue to Chinese President Xi Jinping to be passed to the Buddhist community in China as a symbol of peace and recognition of history between the countries.\n\n\"It's important that this isn't done quietly; we could hand it back tomorrow to a Buddhist organisation in China, and no-one would ever hear about this,\" he said.\n\n\"What's important is having the government acknowledge its importance as a sacred item, and acknowledge the importance of repatriating that item to the people that it belongs to.\"\n\nFossicking through the pearling camps\n\nDennis Hoult has uncovered several historical artefacts, including what appear to be Chinese cash coins, once used up until the 20th century. (ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nDennis Hoult has spent his life in the Shark Bay region as a commercial fisher, but his father was the last pearler in Shark Bay, taking over the family business from his father.\n\nNumerous remnants of old pearling camps have been discovered across Shark Bay. (ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nHis great-grandmother was half Malay and half Aboriginal, while his great-grandfather was a Malay man from Broome, drawn to the area to find the area's unique pearls with gold lustre and abundant pearl shell.\n\nUnder the Pearling Act, Shark Bay licences were issued by the WA government to regulate and control the industry. (ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nHe remembers his family speaking about the pearling camps scattered across the region, and himself fossicking and finding some trinkets, belt buckles and coins.\n\n\"I have a map that we collated together with my uncle before he passed a few years ago, and we've got all the names of all the pearling camps, and there was something like 55,\" he said.\n\nDennis Hoult descends from one of Shark Bay's pioneering pearling families. (ABC Midwest and Wheatbelt: Chris Lewis)\n\nHonouring Nick's legacy of peace\n\nMr Deschamps' quest for public acknowledgement of Chinese pearlers is motivated by his late friend Nick Pedrocchi, who died in 2022.\n\nMalgana man Nick Pedrocchi, who passed in 2022, was a cherished friend to Leon and Shayne.

Look how green and lush it is',\" he said.\n\n\"Well, that's called a green drought because there's no bulk in that green, there's no fibre in that green, and that is unusual but that's part of the problem we have when we have a drought.\n\n\" To the eye it looks great but when you're farming you know it's not anywhere near it where it would be. \"\n\nBack in the Adelaide Hills, even with some rain, Ms Burr said she has struggled to grow grass and her fields have been overcome with weeds.\n\nMs Burr says she has to keep the weeds if she wants to maintain moisture. (ABC News: Ashlin Blieschke)\n\n\"There is a lot of green around but if you have a look, it is capeweed \u2014 all that yellow flower is capeweed,\" she said.\n\nMs Burr said she had no choice but to keep the weeds if she wanted any hope of maintaining moisture in the ground.\n\nFarmers forced to innovate\n\nThe challenge of drought has also presented opportunities for innovation, as farmers find new ways to keep producing under the strain of the conditions.\n\n\"I think the positive from these dry seasons really has been our ability to grow grain on so little rainfall,\" Mr Wundersitz said.\n\n\"Even as little as 10 years ago we would have basically produced just about nothing, but we just keep edging forward and our productional farming systems just become more and more sustainable.\"",

(ABC News: Dunja Karagic)\n\nBut some analysts, such as head of energy research at MST Financial, Saul Kavonic, argue Woodside should be more worried about the project's financial viability.\n\n\"The cost of the development itself ... leave us with a questionable set of economics for the project,\" he said.\n\nBig up-front costs\n\nThe gas industry has had its eyes on Browse for decades, but past efforts have failed to clear the economic hurdle of drilling for gas in such a remote location.\n\nWoodside needs to build a drilling platform, two floating production facilities and drill around 20 gas wells almost 300 kilometres off WA's Kimberley coast.\n\nTo process the gas, it would need to be transported via a 900-kilometre pipeline to the North West Shelf facility in Karratha.\n\nMr Kavonic said the idea was considered and then abandoned 15 years ago.\n\n\"They [also] looked to do the James Price Point development [in the Kimberley], which turned out to be too costly,\" he said.\n\n\"They looked to do floating LNG which turned out to be too risky.\"\n\nWhen Woodside abandoned plans to develop Browse as a floating LNG project in 2016, the WA premier at the time said the company was facing engineering costs above $50 billion.\n\nComplicated joint venture\n\nAnother hurdle for the project is its complicated corporate structure.\n\nWhile Woodside is the company the public associates with Browse, the project is a joint venture between several gas players who have agreed to share responsibility for its profits, losses and costs.\n\nBrowse joint venture Company Interest (%) Woodside 30.6 BP Developments Australia 44.33 Japan Australia LNG 14.40 PetroChina International Investment 10.67\n\nMr Kavonic said any of the partners could effectively veto the project if they decided it was not in their interest.\n\n\"So you need to herd a lot of cats, a lot of disparate interests, in order to get this over the line,\" he said.\n\nOptimistic oil price\n\nMr Kavonic is not the project's only sceptic.\n\nA new report from climate research group Accela Research states many of the assumptions driving Browse's profitability are \"fragile\".\n\nOne of those is the long-term price of oil \u2014 the yardstick commonly used when the oil and gas industry plans for the future.\n\nDeveloping Browse would mean drilling gas wells within 10 kilometres of the remote Scott Reef.

(Sydney Opera House/Tallis Scholars: Jess Mac)\n\nBut Phillips wanted to specialise in a cappella music, which ranges from intimate, secret masses written for three to five voices, to choral extravaganzas.\n\nThomas Tallis, the group's namesake, wrote a 40-part vocal piece called Spem In Alium, which requires at least 40 singers to perform.\n\nMuch of this music was consigned to the archives.\n\nBut today, thanks to groups like the Tallis Scholars, they have become incredibly popular.\n\nFrom amateurs to Renaissance rock stars\n\nThe Tallis Scholars are famed for their unique, crystal-clear singing, which has become the gold-standard for many choirs.\n\nMembers of the original group started as amateurs, but over the years, they became professional a cappella singers with a huge catalogue of recordings.\n\nThe group's extensive catalogue amassed a following, earning them the accolade of \"renaissance rock stars.\"\n\nThe Tallis Scholars first came to Australia in 1985 and have made frequent visits over the years. (Sydney Opera House/Tallis Scholars)\n\nPhillips says many of these albums were recorded in a church in the English countryside.\n\nThe group also started touring, first to Belgium and Europe, before taking on the world, including Australia in 1985.\n\n\"Australia was our first big tour,\" Phillips says. \"We were completely inexperienced, but we had to shape up.\"\n\nSingers like Moore remember travelling all over the world and connecting with fans on these tours.\n\n\"The Tallis Scholars managed to capture the imagination of everyone who was going to geek out about this music,\" Moore says. \"And [those fans] would listen to everything they recorded.\"\n\nWorking with centuries of choral music\n\nThe group usually takes 10 singers on tour, but they perform pieces as wide-ranging as 12th-century chants by Hildegard von Bingen to music by living composers Arvo P\u00e4rt and Nico Muhly.\n\nFormer organist for Queen Elizabeth shares what it's like working with royals Photo shows A close-up shot of organist James O'Donnell in a suit with pocket hankerchief, seated at an organ. James O'Donnell was the former Organist of Westminster Abbey, directing music heard during historic occasions. He shares his favourite moments working with the royals.\n\n\"The sound is just coming from the small group of singers who are on the stage, so it can feel quite intimate,\" says Elisabeth Paul, one of the singers currently touring Australia.\n\n\"I get comments from audience members I meet after concerts who are blown away by [the sound].\"\n\nWhile in Australia, The Tallis Scholars will also be joined by Melbourne bass-baritone Lachlan McDonald, who was invited to sing with the group after one of their regular singers became unavailable.\n\nPhillips says music written more recently can go hand in hand with the centuries-old music that The Tallis Scholars are known for.\n\nOne reason this works is because composers of church music throughout history often use chant melodies harking back to one of the oldest sources of written notation: the Gregorian chant tradition.\n\nIf you're familiar with these chants, you can find them like clues in music across the centuries, Phillips explains.\n\nOne of the staples of the group's touring repertoire is Miserere by 17th-century composer Gregorio Allegri, which incorporates plainchant and more elaborate renaissance polyphony.\n\nThe performance features offstage soloists, including a spine-tingling high C in the treble part.\n\n\"It's the one piece that everybody knows and it's the one piece they want to hear,\" Phillips says.\n\nMany chamber choirs and small ensembles have been formed since The Tallis Scholars brought sacred Renaissance polyphony to global concert stages.\n\nMoore now works and sings with The Song Company, an Australian vocal ensemble that was formed in 1984.\n\nThey often perform the same kind of music as The Tallis Scholars, as well as choral music written by Australian composers today.\n\nDespite the ease of finding this music on streaming platforms, Moore says there's something special about witnessing singers performing live on stage.\n\n\"There's a tremendous power in the human voice, in its ability to reach, touch and move people,\" Moore says.\n\n\"Sometimes we're trying to make them laugh, sometimes we're trying to make them cry, but as singers, our primary goal is always trying to connect with the audience through music.\"\n\nThe Tallis Scholars are touring Australia from October 5-12, performing in Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney.

        "text": "Echoing amongst the gum trees under the blazing sun of Willawong in Brisbane's south is a sound typical of the Irish countryside for countless generations.\n\nThe thwack of a leather ball flying off an ash stick, the whip-like crack of ash on ash.\n\nThe ancient Irish sport of hurling has been a part of life in rural Ireland for centuries.\n\nThe sport's roots are steeped in the mythological tales of Fionn mac Cumhaill and C\u00fa Chulainn, and its earliest written reference is in a document from over 3,000 years ago.\n\nOn the face of it, this most Irish of sports may not be synonymous with modern Australia.\n\nYet hurling, along with Gaelic football, has been playing a key role in the life of Irish expats for over 150 years, both as a tie to a distant home and an enduring symbol of Irish identity.\n\nThe Australasian Gaelic Games Championships\n\nHurling is a mix of lacrosse, hockey and football all mixed into one. (Supplied: An Astr\u00e1il/Julie Anne Miller)\n\nAround 400 players, representing 19 teams from across Australia and New Zealand, converged on Brisbane for the 2025 Australasia Gaelic Games Championships on Friday, with the finals set for Sunday.\n\nThe championships have been contested almost every year since 1974 and feature a mix of expat Irish players and an increasing number of Aussies who have stumbled across the sports.\n\nThe players are, particularly in hurling and camogie (the women's version of the game, which is nearly identical bar the name) predominantly expats.\n\nVictoria has representatives of 15 different Irish counties in its 27-man hurling squad, with defender Tommy Gallagher playing inter-county for Westmeath.\n\nVictoria defender Tommy Gallagher played inter-county hurling for Westmeath. (ABC Sport: Simon Smale)\n\n\"Hurling, on a summer's day like this, it's the best sport in the world,\" Gallagher says after his side beat out Queensland 3-18 to 2-12 in a fierce battle in the midday sun.\n\nGallagher, like plenty of his teammates, is a hurler of some repute.\n\nHe was a part of the Westmeath side that won the second-tier Joe McDonagh Cup at Croke Park in 2021.\n\nGallagher has lived in Australia for three years, working in the Melbourne construction industry, and, like many of the Irish diaspora, the local GAA club was his first port of call when he landed.\n\nVictoria held off a late surge from Queensland to win their opening clash of the 2025 Australasia Championships. (ABC Sport: Simon Smale)\n\n\"Really, wherever I went in the world, you'd always go and find the GAA club,\" Gallagher says.\n\n\"You make your contacts there and like, if you ask any of the lads here, the GAA club is really where you get work, and that's across the board anywhere in the world.\n\n\"I was in New York and the same thing, you went to the GAA club and you've got a job straight away.\n\n\"The Irish community abroad is great like that. You really look after each other.\"\n\nA home away from home\n\nCamogie is the women's version of hurling, although there are no discernible differences between the sports aside from the name. (Supplied: An Astr\u00e1il/Julie Anne Miller)\n\nAs an often-used Irish phrase, N\u00edl aon tinte\u00e1n mar do thinte\u00e1n f\u00e9in, will tell you, there's no place like home.\n\nYet for many of the 100,000-plus Ireland-born people living in Australia and 2.4 million who claim Irish descent, sport is helping to make a mockery of the 16,000km distance between the two nations.\n\n\"It's kinda nearly like a home away from home,\" NSW camogie coach Ciara Holden tells ABC Sport of the atmosphere at her local GAA club on the Central Coast.\n\n\"You know everybody is there because they want to be playing and have the same interests, I suppose it's like your family, in a way.\"\n\nCiara Holden is a former camogie player with Kilkenny. (ABC Sport: Simon Smale)\n\nHolden played camogie for powerhouse county Kilkenny but has been in Australia almost six years now, and underlined how important the local club was for expats, whether they played the sport or not.\n\n\"It's such a good way to meet people,\" Holden says.\n\n\"When you come over, at first it's daunting having to start again, new teams and clubs.\n\n\"The social aspect is just as important for people coming over \u2026 whether you play or you don't play.\"\n\nVictorian Gaelic footballer Orlagh Farmer agrees.\n\n\"I suppose that's the beauty of sport,\" Farmer tells ABC Sport.\n\n\"It brings people together and, particularly the Irish community, no matter where you are, you just fit in \u2026 it's just that sense of belonging and sense of community is really important.\n\nSix-time All-Ireland winner Orlagh Farmer is enjoying her time in Australia. (ABC Sport: Simon Smale)\n\n\"Just speaking to some of the girls on the Victorian team, they were kind of saying they'd be lost without Gaelic, that had they not joined the club here, they would have struggled to make friends and to make memories \u2014 and that's what it's all about.\n\n\"We'll never again be this team. We'll never play [together]. So you kind of have to appreciate that for what it is as well. Like, it's one moment in time, it's going to be gone on Sunday, hopefully after we win and we'll have even better memories.\n\n\"But look, what is it they say? The medal will tarnish, but the memories won't. I'm a big believer in that, too.\n\n\"Obviously, we want to win and we want to have those good times too, but at the same time, it's the people, that's what matters at the end of the day.\n\n\"You won't really look back in 20, 30 years' time, 'where's my medal from the State Games', you look back and say, 'it was brilliant, we nearly sizzled in the sun there back in Brisbane,' but that's what you want.\n\n\"And that's the joy of sport, I guess. That's what it can bring.\"\n\n'It's in our blood'\n\nThe Senior Ladies Gaelic Football Championship featured the highest quality of players. (Supplied: An Astr\u00e1il/Julie Anne Miller)\n\nThe community aspect of the GAA is a huge part, but so too is the competition, the standard of which is astonishing.\n\nAnd Farmer should know \u2014 she has summitted the pinnacle of the sport, winning six All Ireland ladies football championships with Cork in front of 50,000 fans at Croke Park.\n\n\"I've been living and working in Australia the last year and I always wanted to, I suppose, play my national sports in another country,\" Farmer says.\n\n\"It's that pride and being able to actually represent your national sports abroad.\n\n\"I just think it's amazing that you can travel, you get to play with other people, you get to meet new people \u2026 it's fantastic.\"\n\nPlayers representing all 32 counties of the island of Ireland are represented. (Supplied: An Astr\u00e1il/Julie Anne Miller)\n\nIrish sports are not entirely unfamiliar to Australian sports fans \u2014 the so-called Irish experiment brought Jim Stynes to Melbourne in the 1980s, while semi-regular contests between Ireland and Australia in the International Rules from 1984 also exposed Australians to the national sport of Ireland.\n\nThere is evidence to say that Ireland's sporting connection to Australia goes much further back than that.\n\nNewspaper reports suggest that hurling has been played in Australia since the 1840s, decades before the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) instigated a hurling revival in Ireland in the 1880s.\n\nThe GAA grew from a small organisation into a sporting and cultural behemoth in Ireland, intrinsically linked to a sense of Irishness forged as the nation fought for its independence from Britain in the early 20th century.\n\n\"It's just a common thread, it's almost like an unseen thing,\" Farmer says.\n\n\"It's in our blood. It's in our DNA, being a GAA player.\"\n\nThe Aussies\n\nSiena Covino stumbled into Gaelic football by chance. Now, she's hooked. (ABC Sport: Simon Smale)\n\nNot all the players taking part have such a rich Gaelic footballing heritage as Farmer.\n\nSiena Covino is no stranger to playing football \u2014 she was named best and fairest for National Premier Leagues SA side Campbelltown City SC this past year \u2014 and it was through those soccer connections that she was introduced to Gaelic.\n\n\"I've grown up playing soccer my entire life,\" Covino says.\n\n\"In 2018-ish I had a soccer friend and she said, 'Oh, we need some numbers to fill a Gaelic footy team, can you come and join?' and I said, 'absolutely, number one and number two, what's that?'\"\n\nUndaunted and prepped with a couple of YouTube tutorials, Covino turned up at training with Flinders O'Neill initially just to keep up her soccer fitness during the summer, then for a genuine love of the sport.\n\n\"Soccer is a very technical, very strict sport where I feel in Gaelic I am able to be more creative and build more confidence on the ball,\" Covino says.\n\n\"There's a bit more flexibility, I always say it's like if AFL and soccer had a baby, that's what Gaelic is, and so I could use a lot of my soccer skills and felt confident in that.\n\n\"But to me it's just like an art form on the pitch. So I really enjoy playing it.\"\n\nSiena Covino has represented the Australia-born team at the GAA World Games. (Supplied: An Astr\u00e1il/Julie Anne Miller)\n\nIt helps that the community is so welcoming as well.\n\n\"I don't know, I just love the Irish community. I find the Irish very similar to the Italian [community],\" Covino, a second-generation Italian, says.\n\n\"Very family-oriented, very community, very welcoming, it kind of feels like home. It feels familiar.\"\n\nWatching Covino play, alongside her South Australian teammates in the intermediate ladies football competition as they ran North Queensland ragged in a 1-10 to 0-2 victory, it's hard to tell that she's a relative novice.\n\nEnergetic and blessed with impressive pace, Covino has that eye for space innate to footballers, coupled with the sense of where pressure is coming from and how to escape from it.\n\nIt's easy to see how, just five years after hearing about the sport, she was playing for the Australian-born Australasian team at the GAA World Games in Derry.\n\nA large number of the South Australian players do not have an Irish background. (Supplied: An Astr\u00e1il/Julie Anne Miller)\n\n\"That was just an insane experience,\" Covino says.\n\n\"I'd spent three months or four months already travelling at that point, so being able to play sport, have competition, have a community like your team but then also meeting so many people from all different areas of the world.\n\n\"Oh man, it's just like all my favourite things in one.\"\n\nGaelic games go global\n\nTrina Murray was appointed president of the Ladies Gaelic Football Association in March 2025. (ABC Sport: Simon Smale)\n\nThat GAA World Games says a lot about the expanded reach of Gaelic sport.\n\nAt that 2023 World Games, more than 1,500 players representing 93 teams from as diverse locations as Australia, Argentina, Canada, Europe, Asia and the Middle East took part in a four-day event.\n\nTrina Murray, the newly appointed president of the Ladies Gaelic Football Association, said it was \"incredible\" to see Gaelic sports flourishing all around the world.\n\n\"It's just incredible to see, so far away from home, to have so many people playing our sport,\" she says.\n\n\"There's so many homegrown [Australian and New Zealand] players now and you wouldn't actually know that they weren't Irish, their skill is immense and they've really embraced our sport.\n\n\"It's fantastic, it's grown and grown. I'm so proud of ladies football and the Gaelic family as a whole and it's wonderful to see so many players playing our sport and they've really embraced it, they've embraced the culture and the spirit of our game. It's just immense.\"\n\nThe connection between the Ladies Gaelic Football Association and Australia is perhaps even larger than in men's football due to the large number of Irish players making their way to the AFLW in recent years.\n\nTwo-time AFLW Premiership player with Brisbane Orla O'Dwyer has played both football and camogie at All Ireland level for Tipperary. (Getty Images: Sportfile/Piaras \u00d3 M\u00eddheach)\n\nFar from seeing this as a drain of talent, though, Murray says it shows the value Gaelic football \u2014 which remains staunchly amateur \u2014 has.\n\n\"I think we've over 30 players now from our inter-county teams playing out here [in the AFLW],\" Murray says.\n\nIrish influx is shaping the game in AFLW Photo shows A Geelong AFLW player on one knee in the goalsquare raises a fist in celebration after kicking a goal. The AFLW has had an influx of Irish talent in recent years, with the new talent helping change the game.\n\n\"It's a fantastic opportunity for the players, and look, you can't blame them, you've got everything here, you've got the weather, it's a professional sport as well.\"\n\nDespite her pedigree, Farmer says she has not been tempted to try out for an AFLW team: \"I think I've kind of gone past that,\" she says, adding that the number of players in the league is a \"credit to Gaelic football\".\n\nInstead, she will stick with the round ball, helping to inspire the next generation of homegrown players.\n\n\"A lot of Irish are here now over the last 10 years and their kids are playing,\" she says.\n\n\"I actually coach a team in Melbourne now, Young Melbourne, and you've over 100 young kids turning up on a Sunday morning to train in Gaelic football, camogie, hurling \u2014 and it's just fantastic to see.\n\n\"No matter where you go, you can bring the hurley stick and you can bring the Gaelic football.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

Wallabies save their worst for last\n\nThe Wallabies\u2019 11th loss in a row to the All Blacks in Perth is an unwanted record that has crept up stealthily, and as it now spans three coaching regimes, it is not solely owned by the current group.\n\nBut what will frustrate them after the 28\u201314 loss \u2014 their widest margin of defeat in the Rugby Championship \u2014 is the nagging suspicion that they lost too many of the effort areas in the second half.\n\nBy my count, there were three kick chases in which the All Blacks showed more urgency, all leading to either turnovers or an accumulation of pressure. While black jerseys swarmed around the ball, there were fewer Wallabies in support, and by the final 10 minutes, the struggling Tane Edmed was almost an isolated figure in the backfield.",

Credit: The Age Collingwood Draft picks: 34, 52, 64, 70\n\nKey players: Brody Mihocek, Mason Cox, Tom Mitchell, Bobby Hill Coach Craig McRae said he wanted a balance between securing established talent, while also having a good draft hand. Swans key forward Jack Buller is Magpies-bound on a two-year deal, and that should not be too complicated a trade, but they are not likely to pursue Demons defender Steven May. Jamie Elliott will stay, rejecting a three-year offer from the Suns to re-sign for two seasons, but Brody Mihocek is headed to Melbourne. Bobby Hill only recently signed a contract extension, but rival clubs have asked about him, after personal issues impacted the end of his season. Collingwood encouraged Mason Cox and Tom Mitchell to explore their options elsewhere. \u2013 Jon Pierik Essendon\n\nDraft picks: 4, 5, 22, 25\n\nKey players: Sam Draper, Zach Merrett Hawthorn wait with bated breath to see if the Bombers will trade captain Zach Merrett after his shock meeting with Hawks coach Sam Mitchell. The six-time club champion wants to play finals football and contend for flags, both of which have proven elusive at Essendon. Sam Draper has already announced he is leaving in free agency for Brisbane. The Bombers were aggressively pursuing in-demand Sun Sam Flanders but missed out, and are battling Port Adelaide for Gold Coast\u2019s free agent winger Brayden Fiorini. Hawks key defender Jai Serong is also a player of interest, while they could make a play for young Roo Zane Duursma, brother of Xavier. Delisted defender Jayden Laverde will sign with GWS post-draft. \u2013 Marc McGowan Sam Draper has played his last game for the Bombers. Credit: Getty Images Fremantle Draft picks: 11, 29, 38, 47, 65\n\nKey players: Will Brodie, Liam Reidy\n\nAfter being starved of opportunities, Will Brodie and Liam Reidy will head to Port Adelaide and Carlton, respectively, while speculation about Sean Darcy\u2019s future happens every year \u2013 and every season he stays. Fremantle have convinced mobile Melbourne defender Judd McVee to play alongside Jordan Clark, but will need to broker a trade with the Demons, who were disappointed to lose him. They are also open to trading their first pick in this year\u2019s heavily compromised draft, which will be pushed back by academy and father-son selections. \u2013 Peter Ryan Judd McVee is on his way out of Melbourne. Credit: AFL Photos Geelong Draft picks: 17, 35, 53, 71\n\nKey players: Rhys Stanley The Cats are bringing in ex-Hawk and local lad James Worpel on a four-year deal to add to their midfield depth. While Worpel is not an A-grader, Geelong\u2019s lack of midfield depth was obvious in the grand final. They are in the hunt for Charlie Curnow, the Blues forward keen for a fresh start, although a trade will be extremely complicated. St Kilda ruckman Rowan Marshall has requested a trade to the Cats, although the Saints have previously said they won\u2019t budge. It shapes as a fascinating trade period for Geelong, who want to remain in the premiership hunt. \u2013 Jon Pierik\n\nGeelong have landed James Worpel. Credit: AFL Photos Gold Coast Draft picks: 6, 13, 16, 31, 56, 67\n\nKey players: Connor Budarick, Sam Flanders, Bailey Humphrey, Malcolm Rosas jnr Champion Demon Christian Petracca has requested a trade to the Suns, and looms as the club\u2019s biggest recruit since Gary Ablett jnr. Now they need to appease Melbourne in a deal, and this is their priority over any potential Charlie Curnow pursuit, which is looking unlikely. Gold Coast are so far resisting making Bailey Humphrey available, but the forward-midfielder has interest from three clubs, including the Dees, who are also in a four-way race for Sam Flanders. Connor Budarick and Malcolm Rosas jnr requested trades to Western Bulldogs and Sydney, respectively, while Port Adelaide and Essendon are keen on free agent winger Brayden Fiorini. The Suns missed out on Jamie Elliott in free agency, but have met with troubled Bulldog Jamarra Ugle-Hagan and registered interest in contracted Swan James Rowbottom. \u2013 Marc McGowan GWS\n\nDraft picks: 12, 30, 32\n\nKey players: Jacob Wehr, Leek Aleer, Wade Derksen The Giants will ask for a first-round selection for Leek Aleer, but the Saints won\u2019t be handing one over easily despite the lucrative contract on offer, and the fact he played the final 13 matches in defence. Wade Derksen is in limbo; the Demons lost interest after trying to land him last season as he seeks more AFL opportunities, while Jacob Wehr is off to Port Adelaide as a free agent. Essendon\u2019s Jayden Laverde has joined the Giants, and they are interested in Demon Clayton Oliver, who has fallen out of favour. \u2013 Peter Ryan Hawthorn Draft picks: 8, 26, 55, 69\n\nKey players: James Worpel, Jai Serong, Henry Hustwaite, Cam Mackenzie Restricted free agent midfielder James Worpel has left for Geelong on a four-year deal, but Sam Butler resisted West Coast\u2019s strong interest to ink a new two-year deal. He will now hope for more midfield time. Jai Serong, who was hindered by the additions of Josh Battle and Tom Barrass this year, has been linked to North Melbourne, Essendon and Sydney. Cam Mackenzie played 12 games this year, and has interest from the Saints, while midfielder Henry Hustwaite had little opportunity this year, with Richmond among his suitors. \u2013 Jon Pierik\n\nLoading Melbourne Draft picks: 23, 53, 59\n\nKey players: Steven May, Judd McVee, Clayton Oliver, Christian Petracca, Charlie Spargo The Demons\u2019 flag-winning era is officially over, with coach Simon Goodwin sacked, Christian Petracca requesting a trade to Gold Coast, and both Steven May and Clayton Oliver encouraged to explore opportunities elsewhere. Charlie Spargo, who also played in the 2021 premiership, inked a free agency deal with North Melbourne, while wanted defender Judd McVee requested a trade home to Fremantle. Melbourne have lured Collingwood forward Brody Mihocek on a three-year deal, which could be via trade or free agency, while they hope to trade for St Kilda ruckman Max Heath. Beyond them, new coach Steven King has met with contracted Sun Bailey Humphrey. They are no longer interested in untried Giant Wade Derksen. \u2013 Marc McGowan North Melbourne\n\nDraft picks: 20, 21, 39, 57\n\nKey players: Jy Simpkin Contracted skipper Jy Simpkin wants more midfield time, but is yet to put in a trade request. If he did, the Kangaroos would drive a hard bargain for any suitors. Melbourne premiership forward Charlie Spargo joins as a free agent after an injury-riddled two seasons. An elite kick inside 50, Spargo is a handy, cheap addition if he can get on the park regularly. They are in the market for Hawks key defender Jai Serong after missing out on St Kilda\u2019s Marcus Windhager, who re-signed, and Gold Coast\u2019s Connor Budarick, who nominated the Western Bulldogs instead. \u2013 Peter Ryan Will the Roos lose their co-captain Jy Simpkin? Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Port Adelaide Draft picks: 24, 42, 60\n\nKey players: Zak Butters\n\nLoading It will be interesting to see how the Power position themselves heading into Josh Carr\u2019s maiden season in charge. Fremantle midfielder Will Brodie, contracted until the end of 2027, has requested a trade to Alberton, seeking greater opportunity. Giant Jacob Wehr, a running defender and wingman, has signed with the Power as an unrestricted free agent, while they are trying to convince Gold Coast\u2019s Brayden Fiorini to join them as a free agent. Silky midfielder Zak Butters will be a restricted free agent next year, but could be lured home to Victoria despite the Power and his manager insisting he will remain. He has been offered a two-year extension, plus a player option to extend it by a further six years, but he is yet to sign. \u2013 Jon Pierik Richmond Draft picks: 2, 3\n\nKey players: Tylar Young Much-improved defender Tylar Young requested a trade to West Coast after a strong second half of the season, in a blow to the Tigers, who remain in rebuilding mode and are unlikely to be overly active in the trade period. They missed out on Gold Coast goalsneak Malcolm Rosas jnr, who picked the Swans over them, but those are the cheap types they are most likely to target. Richmond are willing to trade their No.3 pick, which they acquired from North Melbourne, for the right deal after selecting seven players in the top 30 last year. \u2013 Marc McGowan\n\nRowan Marshall wants out of the Saints as Tom De Koning arrives. Credit: AFL Photos St Kilda Draft picks: 7, 43, 58\n\nKey players: Rowan Marshall, Jack Steele, Callum Wilkie All-Australian defender Callum Wilkie entertained a serious offer from the Bulldogs before deciding not to push for a trade with two years remaining on his contract. Rowan Marshall might reach Geelong, but there is plenty of water to go under the bridge, while skipper Jack Steele is set to stay, too, despite the Saints encouraging him to look around. St Kilda have landed free agents Tom De Koning and Jack Silvagni, and have the Giants\u2019 Leek Aleer and West Coast\u2019s Liam Ryan wanting to join them. The Suns\u2019 Sam Flanders has nominated them as his new home \u2013 the No.7 pick is likely what gets the deal done. It\u2019s an unprecedented opening of the piggy bank as they attempt to return to premiership contention. It may lose them Marshall. \u2013 Peter Ryan Sydney\n\nDraft picks: 9, 27, 45, 63\n\nKey players: James Rowbottom Gold Coast forward Malcolm Rosas jnr has chosen Sydney as his preferred new home, but it\u2019s Charlie Curnow whom the Swans dearly want. The star Blue has three clubs he is keen to get to \u2013 Gold Coast, Geelong or Sydney. However, as the Cats said, it\u2019s going to take something special to get a deal done for a man who is contracted to Carlton until the end of 2029. The Swans delisted Aaron Francis and Robbie Fox, who are now on the Giants\u2019 radar. James Rowbottom is contracted for three more seasons, but the Suns are interested in the tough midfielder. \u2013 Jon Pierik Malcolm Rosas has nominated the Swans as his preferred new home. Credit: AFL Photos West Coast Draft picks: 1, 15, 19, 33, 51\n\nKey players: Oscar Allen, Tyler Brockman, Campbell Chesser, Liam Ryan\n\nLoading It has already been an eventful off-season for the wooden-spooners, with Richmond defender Tylar Young requesting a trade west and dual premiership-winning Lions defender Brandon Starcevich agreeing to join them as well. The Eagles plan to trade for Starcevich instead of signing him in free agency, to avoid diluting their compensation for Allen leaving for Brisbane. The AFL awarded West Coast an end-of-first-round selection as part of an assistance package, which could be the key piece in trading for Starcevich. Campbell Chesser and All-Australian forward Liam Ryan requested trades to Carlton and St Kilda, respectively. Close friend Ryan\u2019s impending exit could lead to Tyler Brockman exploring his options as well. \u2013 Marc McGowan Western Bulldogs Draft picks: 10, 28\n\nKey players: Buku Khamis, Jamarra Ugle-Hagan The Bulldogs made a big offer to St Kilda\u2019s Callum Wilkie in a long-shot attempt to prise him out of the Saints as they seek to bolster their defence, but he is set to stay after a pay rise. Buku Khamis wants a trade to the Blues, while Jamarra Ugle-Hagan has almost certainly played his last match for the club. He will either be traded to the Suns on a new contract or take a long road back to the AFL. The Dogs also landed the big body they were after, with the Suns\u2019 Connor Budarick asking to be traded to the Kennel. But they missed out on Deven Robertson, who chose West Coast instead as his preferred new home. \u2013 Peter Ryan",

Darkness cloaked the surface of the deep. Not for long. The Earth cooled. Far to the south, glaciers formed. The skirts of the ocean were pulled back, revealing a coastline of striped yellow limestone. And then, over a few thousand years, waves and wind did their work, battering the shoreline into a dramatic form of environmental stonemasonry. A view of the Twelve Apostles, which remains a popular tourist attraction. Credit: Nicole Cleary Today, we call it the Twelve Apostles \u2013 a natural formation that continues to draw millions of tourists from across the country, and the world. There was a time when at least 13 limestone pillars were part of the natural formation. Five of those pillars now sit below the water, gaining the term the \u201cdrowned apostles\u201d by researchers. The last apostle to drown came crashing down in 2005, leaving just seven standing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoastline experts say it is a matter of when and not if the next sea stack crumbles into the ocean. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one fell down next week,\u201d says David Kennedy, a professor of coastal geomorphology at the University of Melbourne. \u201cI do wonder if I\u2019ll see one collapse each time I visit there.\u201d Despite their collapsing state, the Twelve Apostles remain a popular tourism attraction. Credit: Nicole Cleary Anticipation of the next collapse is against a backdrop of debate about whether visitors should be charged to view the natural attraction while surrounding geological wonders remain closed to the public due to concerns about coastal erosion. Last week, the Great Ocean Road Regional Tourism group and local council called for the introduction of a visitor payment scheme to maintain facilities and help protect the fragile coastline. The push comes after the state government announced completion of a rooftop structure last month as part of a new $126 million visitor centre being built in a redevelopment of the area. The centre will also include shops, eateries and a garden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrincetown resident Dion Webber has been flagging concerns about water discharge at the Twelve Apostles and access closures at nearby sites, including Gibson Steps, Loch Ard Gorge and The Arch. Webber worries that construction work at the Twelve Apostles tourism site is contributing to cliff instability. And he says the closures result in a poorer experience for tourists, who make the trip to the south-west coast, as well as locals. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible to see all this happening,\u201d Webber says. Dion Webber has been raising concerns with water runoff at the Twelve Apostles site. Credit: Nicole Cleary Richard Riordan, Liberal MP for Polwarth, which covers the south-west, says the closure of so many of the area\u2019s tourist sites calls into question the value visitors receive, particularly if they will be charged to visit in future. \u201cThis is such a lost opportunity. It\u2019s such an important part of Victoria\u2019s tourism offer,\u201d he says. \u201cSadly, it\u2019s at risk of being a huge white elephant.\u201d Riordan says the government spending on the Twelve Apostles redevelopment is not commensurate with the condition of the sites, which he argues have been poorly managed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, a state government spokeswoman says the Twelve Apostles redevelopment will transform the destination, ensuring it is safer and easier to experience while encouraging people to stay longer in the region. She says no decisions have been made about charging visitors. A spokesman for the Great Ocean Road Coast and Parks Authority says Gibson Steps will reopen soon and Loch Ard Gorge is still a great place to visit with a new blowhole lookout now open. The authority confirmed it is investigating feasibility options for stairs at Loch Ard Gorge. It is also considering the effect of rain and stormwater volume entering the drainage system from the Twelve Apostles visitor centre site. Asking whether more apostles will fall down misunderstands the landmark, scientists say. They are constantly in the process of eroding and collapsing. \u201cWe are looking at a snapshot in time of 6000 years of the coast retreating,\u201d says Kennedy. \u201cThey are a geographical quirk.\u201d The coastline around Port Campbell was laid down hundreds of millions of years ago, when sea levels were tens of metres higher and the area was a shallow marine bay known as the Otway Basin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwarms of shellfish and single-celled protozoans were born, lived and died here, their shells laid down in sediment that eventually became rich yellow limestone. The sea gradually retreated, no longer sitting atop the rock but now chiselling at its edges. Some rock is too hard to be eroded, like the shoreline at Wilsons Promontory. Some is so soft it could not support the weight of a stack and crumbles away to a cliff-face, like those at Anglesea. Loch Ard Gorge where there have been some access closures. Credit: Nicole Cleary Here, the limestone is just soft enough to weather slowly, but with enough strength to hold up hundreds of tonnes of rock. \u201cThe sea eats at them, and eventually, they fall,\u201d says associate professor Stephen Gallagher, a micropalaeontologist at the University of Melbourne. The problem is predicting just when that collapse might happen.\n\nAdvertisement",

The cut will be backdated to balances on 1 June before indexation was applied.\n\n\n\nThe government estimates about three million Australians will see their debt reduced.\n\n\n\n\n\nA person with an average debt of $27,600 will see $5,520 wiped.\n\n\n\nWhen will my debt be reduced?\n\nThe ATO will begin applying the cut from mid-November, with about half of those with student loans to see their debt slashed by the end of the month. Most others will see the cut applied by mid-December.\n\n\n\nWhy is the debt being cut?\n\nThe government says the debt relief is about recognising the financial pressure faced by many Australians, particularly younger Australians. About 70 per cent of student debt is held by Australians aged 35 or younger.\n\n\n\nDo I need to do anything?\n\nNo, the reduction will be automatically applied to your balance by the ATO.\n\n\n\nWill I still receive the cut if I have paid off my loan?\n\nIf you have repaid your student loans and don\u2019t have a debt balance as of 1 June 2025 you will not receive the cut. The reduction will only apply to debt that exists as of 1 June 2025.\n\n\n\nHow can I check my debt?\n\nYou can check your loan balance via the myGov website after linking your account to the ATO's online services.\n\n\n\nHow much will it cost the government?\n\nThe government expects the reduction will wipe out about $16 billion in student debt.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How does a HECS debt affect your home loan borrowing power?\n\nThis is in addition to $3 billion that was removed after the indexation on student loans was tied to the lower of the wage price index or consumer price index.\n\n\n\n",

It was also good for him that someone was looking after him,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nMilostnik said that, as her children are now grown up, she has largely stopped using location tracking apps, but for years she was comforted by knowing when they returned from school.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also previously used the apps to monitor her mother with dementia, who would sometimes get lost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Having that helped me a lot because there was one day that she got a little bit confused from going to the church in the morning, coming back, and then I could ask a friend of mine to pick her up,\" she said.\n\n\n\nPutting some 'nobility' around it\n\nDespite safety and privacy concerns, an increasing number of Australians are tracking the whereabouts of their children, ageing parents, and sometimes even partners and friends, 24 hours a day, using phone applications such as Life360, Find My iPhone, and Find My Device.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exact number of people in Australia tracking others or being tracked remains unknown.\n\n\n\n\n\nApple said that it doesn't have access to this information, and Life360 \u2014 which has previously reported having more than two million users in Australia \u2014 didn't respond to an SBS News request for information.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Helpful or spying?

We say, well, because life isn't as safe as it used to be, then this is a reflection of how much I love my family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn many ways, Australia is actually safer than it ever was.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of offenders police dealt with in 2023\u201324 was at its lowest recorded level since 2008 to 2009, while we've seen a reduction in homicides and robbery, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the number of certain crimes, such as domestic violence-related assaults and sexual assaults, has increased in recent years.\n\n\n\nData from the ABS shows that there were 40,087 victims of sexual assault recorded in Australia in 2024, a 10 per cent increase from the previous year.\n\n\n\n\n\nShaw said that, with consent, location-tracking can be an immensely useful safety tool in some situations \u2014 such as when a friend tracks another's first date or someone monitors a loved one's trip in an Uber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are ways which are very much in the individual's control, where they can invite people in and then exclude them at other times,\" Shaw said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think in those sorts of ways, where there is regular checking in on consent, the clarity of purpose, all of that is actually a great benefit in how we live our lives.\"\n\n\n\nA normalisation of surveillance?\n\nHowever, some are concerned by what they consider to be a normalisation of surveillance occurring alongside the uptake of location-tracking apps.\n\n\n\n\n\nBridget Harris, director of the Monash Gender and Family Violence Prevention Centre, told SBS News that society has clearly experienced a shift in norms around privacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's how much information we share, the devices we share, and also expectations about that. So, expectations that we are, for instance, findable by our partners, by our children, by everybody,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said that, as digital surveillance creeps into ever-more aspects of our lives \u2014 work, education, interactions with the government \u2014 we come to normalise surveillance in our personal lives.\n\n\n\nResearch shared by the eSafety Commissioner in May showed that almost one in five young adults aged 18 to 24 think it's reasonable to expect to track a romantic partner whenever they want.\n\n\n\n\n\nHarris says the normalisation of location-tracking may lead to victims' calls for help not being taken seriously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If someone's trying to articulate the violence of their experience ... it might be discounted by someone else. They might say, 'Oh no, that's really normal. My partner and I do it too,' but what is actually happening is very different,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShaw said it's \"very important\" that intimate partners openly discuss the use of such technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even if someone dresses up their behaviour as good intentions or caring and concern, if the other doesn't experience it that way, then the issue has to be dealt with.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO 'It's about power': How sexual harassment affects those on the margins SBS News 09:58 English\n\nShaw also warns that, even if it's mutually agreed upon, tracking a partner can shift expectations in a romantic relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People are judging the speed at which their partner responds: 'You didn't respond for an hour, so that means you don't love me',\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are conflating, sometimes, access with love and devotion.\"\n\n\n\n'It's definitely spying'\n\nSome, like Alyssa Carter, say they would never allow their partners to track their locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I wouldn't like a partner to track me at all. I think it is absolutely, for myself, an invasion of my own privacy ... There is no reason for a partner, as far as I'm concerned, to want to know where you are,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarter has always refused to monitor the whereabouts of her 16-year-old daughter, and says her daughter would be horrified at the suggestion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's definitely spying \u2026 I think she would feel absolutely that it was an invasion of her privacy and her autonomy,\" Carter said.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you or someone you know is impacted by family and domestic violence, call 1800RESPECT on 1800 737 732, text 0458 737 732, or visit 1800RESPECT.org.au .

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nAmeerah Silo is carefully packing her bag before hockey training.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's one of the many Yazidi refugees in Toowoomba who are part of a program hoping to give migrants a taste of the sport.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 21-year-old moved to Australia in 2023 and says playing the sport has helped her build English skills and meet new people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the speaking, I don\u2019t know anybody, difficult, first time living in a different country. Like when I go to hockey, like we make a friend and trying together and talking together and we are running together, everything is together.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nToowoomba has the largest Yazidi population in Australia, according to data from the last census.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany now call the regional centre their home, after fleeing Islamic State in northern Iraq and Syria.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis hockey initiative is aiming to build language skills and a sense of belonging for a community with complex needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n18-year-old Asmhan Kankah is also one of the program's participants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hockey Australia has helped us to forget what we've endured before coming to Australia. It has helped us Yazidis to be happier, and that's what I like about it most.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHelping to run the program every Friday is Toowoomba Hockey Association manager Jessie McCartney.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says improving self esteem has helped some Yazidis to find employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We knew that when they first came that they would be nervous and their English language was still developing and they had never played the sport before, so it was really important that we had a very nurturing environment that was just about building connections with people. What we've learnt through the Belong Hockey program is that we actually have to create an environment where people feel like they belong and then that integration happens automatically.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA big part of making the program accessible is through providing transport to training.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocals like Geoff and Karen Murdoch are some of the many retirees that volunteer each week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey drive Ameerah to practice and also help out on the field.\n\n\n\n\n\nKaren says she's made many new young friends, which makes her feel younger too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We felt these kids deserve to have people welcome them into their circle and it took a little while but I think they have come out here and they have found their group. We have been welcomed into their homes at different times for cups of tea or meals and I think they have looked upon us as mentors and almost grandparents and we have just lapped it up and loved it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGeoff says bringing together locals and the refugee community has also helped breakdown misconceptions about refugees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had no understanding of their plight, when we first started. I hadn't heard of Yazidis and where they came from and we have done quite a bit of research on it and you get a much better understanding of what they've been through and what they are trying to deal with and it makes you a lot more caring and understanding of people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of these players like Ameerah have also joined local hockey clubs.\n\n\n\n\n\nJessie again.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "This article contains graphic descriptions and imagery.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween the hours of 9am and 5pm, Joel Bateman is a \"mild-mannered government official\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when night hits, those mild manners are put to bed as he's pummelled into glass panes, thrown off ladders into beds of thumbtacks, and even endures a live whipper snipper ripping the skin raw from his back.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's all pretty standard fare for the life of a deathmatch wrestler.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The stunts we do in deathmatch wrestling are only limited by our imagination,\" Bateman tells SBS News.\n\n\n\nWhen Joel Bateman isn't working his government job, he's making himself bleed in unique and gruesome ways. Source: Supplied / Jake Hurdle (@jhmedia.jpeg) \"The fluorescent light tube is the staple of modern deathmatch wrestling. It's the same thing you'd find in your garage. But all the green initiatives are actually making them harder to find and more expensive \u2014 so we have to get more creative,\" Bateman says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We tend to wrap anything we can find in barbed wire, including the [wrestling] ring itself.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWeapons in a deathmatch wrestler's arsenal might include: staple guns, fire, concrete blocks, cactus plants, gusset plates, thumbtacks and drawing pins, panes of tempered glass (because \"it won't cut you to the point where you need to go to the hospital\"), and perhaps the most surprising \u2014 whipper snippers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've only done whipper snippers three or four times. Every time I do it, I don't remember it being that bad the last time. And then I do it and I go, 'Oh, it hurts exactly as much as I thought it did last time',\" Bateman says.\n\n\n\nIt's like being pink-bellied 150 times in the space of a quarter of a second.\n\nBateman started wrestling in 2001 at the tender age of 11. He had his first match two years later, and his first deathmatch in 2006 at age 16.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe now 36-year-old estimates he's performed over 200 deathmatches \u2014 a number that accelerated significantly since the launch of his own wrestling promotion (business), Deathmatch Downunder.\n\n\n\nIn the world of deathmatch wrestling, anything goes \u2014 even eating glass tubes, like Japanese professional wrestler Abdullah Kobayashi here. Source: Supplied / Jake Hurdle (@jhmedia.jpeg) At first glance, anyone could think death matches are just blood, gore and violence \u2014 and, look, that's partially right \u2014 but for those in this niche little world, it's about so much more.\n\n\n\nWelcome to the world of deathmatch wrestling\n\nDeathmatch wrestling is a subgenre of professional wrestling, Bateman explains.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's standard professional wrestling. Think: World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), with big names like John Cena and The Rock.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, under that umbrella is hardcore wrestling. That's a more turbo version of your standard wrestling match, involving weapons such as chairs, ladders, tables and garbage bins.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there's deathmatch wrestling, which takes hardcore wrestling and turns the dial up by 100.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Instead of using things like chairs and tables, we find ourselves using things like barbed wire, fluorescent light bulbs and fire,\" Bateman says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's like the Police Academy stunt show at Movie World, crossed with a live-action horror movie with the performance art of pro wrestling.\"\n\n\n\nThe first time Jordan Whyte and Joel Bateman wrestled each other in a deathmatch, Jordan got a fluorescent light tube straight to the face. Source: Supplied / Jaden Lee (@jiwcphotos) While professional wrestling is pre-determined (not to be confused with fake), all props used in deathmatch wrestling are 100 per cent real. Matches are a hotbed of creativity with no rules \u2014 except that there needs to be blood. And lots of it.\n\n\n\n\n\nBateman describes it as a \"wide barometer of bloodletting\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Everything is legitimate. Through repetition, you learn how to take these household objects and use them in a way that you could draw blood with them safely \u2014 like the most [bonkers] surgeon you've ever seen,\" he says.\n\n\n\nA double life\n\nThe first time budding primary school teacher Jordan Whyte met Bateman in the ring, he was smashed in the face by a fluorescent light tube.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhyte is relatively new to the deathmatch scene. While he's wrestled under the name Jesse Flynn for about four years, he competed in his first deathmatch in Sydney two months ago \u2014 with Bateman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We had light tubes, chairs, tables and gusset plates \u2014 the things that hold houses together \u2014 which aren't nice,\" Whyte says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The first time I got hit was with the glass tube. I thought it was really hot in there.\n\n\n\nThen I wiped the sweat from my face and was like, 'Oh, I'm gushing blood'.\n\n\"Then Joel set his knee on fire and kneed me in the face.\"\n\n\n\nJordan Whyte first entered the niche world two months ago in a match with legacy deathmatcher, Joel Bateman. They say trust and a good relationship are key components of the process. Source: Supplied / Jaden Lee (@jiwcphotos) The venue held about 120 people. One spectator was a university classmate of Whyte's, who was shocked to see the soon-to-be primary school teacher dripping blood on stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhyte says he's still not sure how to balance his double life, especially with classrooms filled with tiny people on the horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Part of me thinks I should finish my degree, then hang the boots up, but then part of me is hoping that I could still wrestle on weekends while teaching,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know a few wrestlers who are teachers, but they're a very different [wrestling] style \u2026 but I'm like, no \u2014 hit me over the head with a chair. I think that extra step is what makes it such an insane comparison.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, a chair on the head is the least of Whyte's problems. Instead, he says there are three weapons that rank the highest on the pain scale.\n\n\n\nSkewers in the head is one of the most painful stunts in deathmatch wrestling, Jordan Whyte says. (Pictured: Jordan Sampson and Aidan Osbourne). Source: Supplied / Jaden Lee (@jiwcphotos) The first is wooden skewers, which are pierced into the victim's forehead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I knew that would hurt, but when we did it, I was like, I don't want to do this again,\" Whyte says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second is barbed wire.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It gets caught on you,\" Whyte explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'll say yes to using it as long as it stays out of my hair \u2014 I don't want to cut my hair.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third: a Guitar Hero guitar, which Whyte describes as \"weirdly painful\".\n\n\n\nIn deathmatch wrestling, anything goes: even Guitar Hero. Source: Supplied / Jaden Lee (@jiwcphotos) \"It was very solid. When I got it off Facebook Marketplace, the lady was like, 'Are you sure you want it? It doesn't work.' And I was like, 'That's fine, I don't need it to work',\" Whyte says.\n\n\n\nControversial, even in the wrestling world\n\nThere's a lot of stigma that follows deathmatches, even in the professional wrestling world.\n\n\n\n\n\nBateman says before he started his promotion, he'd need to convince promoters to let him do a deathmatch \u2014 and if he managed to get it over the line, they'd often be so traumatised by the event that they'd refuse to host it again.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says it's often been called \"organised barbarism\" by critics and that this controversy isn't new by any means.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the late 1980s, Japanese wrestler Atsushi Onita founded a hardcore promotion in Japan called Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, giving birth to the death match genre.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe promotion staged the first-ever 'Exploding Ring Death Match' in 1990.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's exactly what it sounds like on the tin: barbed wire surrounded the ring and triggered explosions when touched. One iteration featured a countdown timer that, at zero, would cause the entire ring to explode (yes, with people still inside).\n\n\n\nThe death match style started to seep into American television in the 1990s, as a ratings war \u2014 known as the Monday Night Wars \u2014 that erupted between WWE and its competitors, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the three largest Western wrestling dynasties jostled for the top position, one thing became clear \u2014 sex and blood were key, and shock was currency.\n\n\n\n\n\nWWE dabbled in a tamer version. Its 'Buried Alive' match involved tossing an opponent into an open grave and burying them 'alive' with soil. Another derivative was WWE's 'Hell In A Cell' concept, which witnessed two opponents trapped in a ring surrounded by a five-metre-tall wire cage.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver at ECW, things were far more extreme.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach week, matches won with DIY weapons became the standard, making the promotion synonymous with the bloody and violent subculture, but also a haven for those who wanted a more brutal viewing experience. Both Whyte and Bateman credit ECW as the inspiration for their own careers.\n\n\n\nNew Jack was one of the most controversial hardcore wrestlers of all time and carried the label of one of the most dangerous and unpredictable people in the industry's history. Source: Supplied / ECW But it was not without risk: one ECW house show resulted in a 17-year-old aspiring wrestler being injured after he was 'bladed' (the act of intentionally and discreetly cutting oneself in a match to draw blood for dramatic effect) too deeply by another wrestler, New Jack, severing two of his arteries and almost killing him.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother incident led to New Jack and Vic Grimes falling 15 feet, with a miscue sending them straight to the concrete ground. New Jack sustained brain damage and lost sight in one eye.\n\n\n\n\n\nA year later, in a rematch, New Jack allegedly tried to kill Vic Grimes by intentionally going off-script, tasing him and throwing him off the scaffolding. In the wrestling documentary Dark Side of the Ring, New Jack said: \"I was trying to throw his ass to the floor \u2026 He was lying in the ring and I told him, 'Now we're even, you f**cker.\"\n\n\n\nJordan Whyte and Joel Bateman were both inspired by Extreme Championship Wrestling in the 90s, which became synonymous with deathmatch-style wrestling. Source: Supplied / Jaden Lee (@jiwcphotos)\n\n'Organised barbarism' unfairly 'demonised'\n\nWrestling's great debate lies in what constitutes a \"shoot\" \u2014 something real and unscripted \u2014 and a \"work\" \u2014 an intentional and predetermined part of the script that's designed to look spontaneous and real.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven today, there are still debates over whether New Jack's attempted killing of Vic Grimes was real or just a masterful example of 'kayfabe' \u2014 the wrestling term for portraying events in a fictional narrative as real and genuine.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhatever the truth, deathmatches in the mainstream died as WWE's competitors did. With the company now firmly in its 'PG Era', blood and violence on screen are largely a thing of the past.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome say that's for good reason.\n\n\n\nDeathmatch wrestling has its share of critics \u2014 even from those within the professional wrestling industry. Source: Supplied / Jaden Lee (@jiwcphotos) Critics of deathmatch wrestling say it is inherently dangerous, violent for the sake of violence, and a lesser form of professional wrestling. Others say it's for the talentless and has a low bar for skill. Some say it's dangerous for fans, gives wrestling a bad name, or is just plain repetitive with a limited repertoire.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhyte found that after he entered the world of deathmatches, some local Australian promotions were hesitant to work with him. \"It can be pretty frowned upon,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Certain companies won't use you if you're doing deathmatches.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Bateman says the subgenre is unfairly \"demonised\".\n\n\n\nI take a lot of pride in the fact that we have such a safe space \u2014 both for our performers and fans.\n\n\"In over 60 events we've run [in our promotion] in five years, we've never had an insurance complaint. We've never had a fan injured,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Any fans who have gotten little cuts and scratches from flying glass absolutely love it \u2026 we'll ask if they want a bandaid and they're like, nah, we're fine. We love it. This is why we come here.\"\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, glass is one of the safer weapons in deathmatches. Joel Bateman says it's because they use tempered glass, which \"won't cut you to the point where you need to go to the hospital\". Source: Supplied / Jake Hurdle (@jhmedia.jpeg) Bateman says the Australian scene was almost decimated in 2002 after a \"disgruntled wrestler\" went to the media about a particular \"family-friendly\" deathmatch, calling it \"organised barbarism\" and claiming blood was sprayed on the crowd. In three weeks, crowd numbers went from 1,200 people to 80.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt almost killed the scene entirely, but it's starting to pick up again, albeit slowly, he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Other companies in Melbourne are pushing the envelope more in that deathmatch direction,\" he says, crediting long-term Australian deathmatch wrestlers like KrackerJak and Mad Dog, who have been performing for over 20 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBateman says there is \"quite a roster\" of deathmatch wrestlers in Australia right now, estimating there are between 30 and 40 of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[Attitudes] are starting to change and people are becoming more accepting of it,\" he says.\n\n\n\nMore than blood\n\nDeathmatches are a visceral, violent experience. But for Bateman, they're about so much more \u2014 a place to connect with his First Nations identity.\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil he started his promotion, the Wotjobaluk man wasn't comfortable leading with his Aboriginality as a character trait in the professional wrestling space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't something I leaned into because anytime I did, I was met with a good amount of racism and a good amount of bullying. It was something I pushed down,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you're a face in a crowd, people feel comfortable saying racist shit.\"\n\n\n\nAt first glance, deathmatch wrestling might look like needless violence. But for Joel Bateman, it's also about expressing his First Nations identity. Source: Supplied / Jaden Lee (@jiwcphotos) But Bateman says that launching the promotion at the start of the Black Lives Matter movement was a \"turning point\" for him and gave him the confidence to show himself wholly on stage.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe's since changed his entrance music to Solid Rock by Goanna, a song about Aboriginal land rights. He also started wearing the Aboriginal flag on his tights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remember being kind of nervous to do it,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remember finishing the match and just bursting into tears and then opening my eyes and seeing there was a standing ovation.\n\n\n\nIt was this culmination of 18 years of suppressing my genuine self.\n\nHe says his outward display of his identity has allowed other First Nations wrestlers to lean into theirs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's probably more death match wrestlers in the country than there are First Nations wrestlers in the country, which is something I'm trying to rectify. But it's a very long and very slow journey to do so,\" he says.\n\n\n\nJoel Bateman never felt comfortable with his Aboriginality on display in the ring under he started Deathmatch his promotion (business). Now, he hopes to inspire other First Nations wrestlers in Australia. Source: Supplied / Jake Hurdle (@jhmedia.jpeg) The promotion also started in the midst of professional wrestling's own #MeToo movement \u2014 #SpeakingOut \u2014 which exposed systemic emotional, physical and sexual abuse in the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis meant that, for Bateman, inclusivity was at the forefront of his promotion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We came at a time when people really needed to feel safe, and we put a lot of time and energy into creating that space,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says trans people have come out as their authentic selves for the first time in public at his shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's something that means the absolute world to me. I have a trans son \u2026 the first time they ever [went out in public as themselves] was at a wrestling show as well,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's easy to hate deathmatch wrestling from a distance, he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But there's never been a single person I can recall who's taken the time to come and immerse themselves in an event who hasn't then left and said, 'This is kind of special. There's something different about this'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The world is a tough place in 2025 \u2026 but in wrestling, the real world just stops when you come into that door. It's a form of escapism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can come and be your authentic self.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders seeking support can ring Lifeline crisis support on 13 11 14 or text 0477 13 11 14, visit lifeline.org.au or find an Aboriginal Medical Service here .

And when you're fatigued, you don't really want to tell your male manager, who will say something like 'Oh, what's endometriosis?',\" Hosking said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And you're like, 'dude, I just want to lie in a ball right now, please look it up'.\"\n\n\n\nHosking is one of an estimated one million Australians with endometriosis, a chronic condition where tissue similar to the uterus lining grows outside of the uterus, sometimes in the pelvis or in organs like the ovaries or fallopian tubes.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach month, this tissue thickens and bleeds, which can cause chronic pain, inflammation, fertility issues, and other symptoms like fatigue, bloating and heavy bleeding.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, Endometriosis Australia, the nation's peak endometriosis charity, announced a workplace accreditation scheme designed to address the stigma surrounding the condition in the workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe course, open to all businesses in the country, contains education for employers on endometriosis and how to better support staff.\n\n\n\nRachael Eleanor Hosking poses from a hospital bed on the day she received her endometriosis diagnosis. Living with endometriosis led her to pursue research in the same field. Credit: Supplied Monica Forlano, chair of the board at Endometriosis Australia, said the program \"signals to employees that these employers who are accredited [through the program] understand the condition, and it's a safe place\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know that 70 per cent of people with endo have to take unpaid time off because they've exhausted their personal leave, and people are losing their jobs because they can't make ends meet, and a lot of people actually give up work altogether,\" Forlano told SBS News.\n\n\n\nBillions lost in productivity\n\nEndometriosis affects one in seven Australian women, and a lack of awareness around the disease is costing the country billions each year.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2019 government study found endometriosis costs Australia between $7.4 billion and $9.7 billion per year, with roughly two-thirds of that figure attributed to lost productivity.\n\n\n\n\n\nForlano said the actual figures for the economic loss were likely to be significantly higher.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That $9.7 billion was based on 2018 numbers and we know now that to the age of 49, one in seven women will have endometriosis, so we can only assume that figure is much greater,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian government contributions to research have led to a surge in awareness, but she said we are still far behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We now know that there's not just one type of endometriosis \u2014 there's at least three, and in regards to understanding this condition, we are where breast cancer was 20-30 years ago,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe study further highlighted two key factors that contributed to productivity loss: 'absenteeism', where workers are forced to take leave to manage their symptoms at home, and 'presenteeism', where people may be present in the workforce but are unable to work to their full capacity due to their symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen 52-year-old Calli Brown started her career in media, managing her endometriosis symptoms at work was a \"shameful\" and stressful process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The stress compounded and it was so debilitating, there was a lot of shame, no-one really talked about periods and so there wasn't an environment that was conducive to actually talk about what was going on for you,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown said she would need to take sick days off because of \"excruciating\" pain, which would often lead her to black out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But because you're junior and you're female, and it's a busy environment, and everybody is supposed to be tough, and there are some women who don't experience period pain, there were very few people I felt like I could turn to for support and for understanding,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And so that was very shameful. I would have to take sick days, and at the beginning of your career, you don't want to be having sick days all the time.\"\n\n\n\nLiving with an 'invisible' illness\n\nA survey of 389 workers with endometriosis conducted by Southern Cross University and Western Sydney University, which was supported by Endometriosis Australia, found one in six had lost their jobs to their diagnosis, while one in three said they had been passed over for promotions due to their condition.\n\n\n\nAnna Fragkoudi, a research fellow at The University of Adelaide's School of Public Health, said because endometriosis is an \"invisible\" disease, managers and superiors might not be understanding of the various methods people may need to manage their pain, such as taking sick leave or working from home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is an invisible condition, so people might think, 'Oh, you're all right, so why would you like need to take leave if there is nothing wrong with you?',\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey found that flexible work arrangements introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic were the biggest contributor to increased productivity for people with endometriosis.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Forlano said the real challenge is being able to discuss the diagnosis at work and confronting the stigma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of anxiety and stigma raising your diagnosis, because you are seen as potentially unreliable and consistent,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And that's the experience that I had in my career, when managing the symptoms got so bad that I couldn't function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Chronic pain brings up real mental health issues because it's it's exhausting, and with the fatigue that comes with that, it was really hard to take on high-stress roles.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said \"some kind of empathy\" from employers could go a long way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some little things will make so much difference, commuting when you're having an endo flare just makes symptoms worse so if you can log in at home from your bed, close to your bathroom that you can fill a hot water bottle whenever you need to, or even have a nap at in your lunch break just so you can perform and work \u2014 that's huge for someone with with endo and they can thrive,\" she said.\n\n\n\nBrown said her experience navigating endometriosis in the workplace affected her mental health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You're having to push it down, which then just compounds your symptoms, because you're already really stressed. How can you improve your symptoms and get over something when you're stressed and holding it inside? It just compounds the depression, it compounds the anxiety, it compounds the shame,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said initiatives like the accreditation scheme were important because they established credibility towards a historically hidden and undermined disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of the time, women feel like it has to be a secret \u2014 to actually have a formal process means it's a conversation opener, right? The world is changing, a lot of women are working in male dominated industries and this makes it safe for them to actually start the conversation in a way that is already legitimate.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown said she was happy that her daughter, who has endometriosis, won't have to go through what she did.\n\n\n\nCalli Brown and her daughter are both diagnosed with endometriosis. Credit: Supplied But Hosking, who now researches endometriosis at The University of Adelaide's Robinson Research Institute, said when it came to endometriosis in Australia, awareness was still the \"most important\" step.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's important not only for women to know so that they can know that their period pain is not normal, but knowing that men are also part of this conversation is something that is so important, because men make up [nearly] 50 per cent of the population, and if 50 per cent of the population do not understand the severity of what we are going through, then we're stuck in this sort of rock and a hard place,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's been too long that women have stayed silent, people with endometriosis have just suffered in silence, hid their period products, their TENS machines, their Panadol, they've said, 'Oh, can I just pop to the restroom quickly?'. And then been denied that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said awareness was the first step, and now it's: \"How can we help?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReaders seeking support with mental health can contact Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636.

        "text": "When Margaret Kirkwood broke her hip falling up the stairs of her home in Sydney, she could have become a statistic: falls are the leading cause of hospitalisation and injury deaths in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, the 83-year-old made a remarkable recovery. The day following her surgery, she was standing. Less than two weeks later, she was walking with the aid of a single crutch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The doctor said, 'You're a textbook case'. Your body is in fantastic condition,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nKirkwood credited her recovery to her yoga practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the past 25 years, she has attended Iyengar Yoga classes twice a week.\n\n\n\nKirkwood said it taught her about her body and has given her strength, which she notices while moving about the house and doing chores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If I weren't strong, I would have had a really bad fall,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a surprising new study from The University of Sydney has found that Iyengar yoga \u2014 a distinct form of yoga that uses props and is popular among older people \u2014 should not be recommended as a fall prevention measure.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the biggest clinical trial investigating the effects of yoga on falls, researchers found that while yoga improved self-confidence and mobility, older people who practised yoga experienced a significantly higher incidence of falls.\n\n\n\nAn unexpected result\n\nThe study recruited 700 people over the age of 60 and invited them to participate in two yoga classes each week for a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nHalf of the cohort did Iyengar yoga, while the other half did seated breathing and stretching. Researchers then tracked the number of falls experienced by both groups over the course of that year.\n\n\n\nThere were limitations to the study, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced the classes online. Source: Supplied / Sue-Ellen Kohler Anne Tiedemann, lead researcher and professor of physical activity and health at The University of Sydney, said the results were \"the opposite of what we expected\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have a lot of evidence that exercise, challenges, and balance can prevent falls ... We also know that older people like to do yoga, so we thought it's important to know whether it also prevents falls,\" Tiedemann said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe yoga cohort reported 33 per cent higher rates of falls than the non-yoga-based group, with 276 falls compared to 164. However, there was only a slight increase in the rate of injury, with only 15 per cent of the yoga group and 13 per cent of the non-yoga group experiencing cuts, grazes, dislocations, sprains, fractures, or brain injury as a result of the fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a combination of the environment, your behaviour, and your physiology which determines if you fall or not,\" Tiedemann explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In our study, we identified that people who did the yoga-based exercise showed an improvement in their balance confidence ... So we think what has happened is that people have felt more confident in their abilities, and there was also an indication that they moved about more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTiedemann pointed out that the trial had limitations. Initially, the classes were held face-to-face, but when COVID-19 emerged, they transitioned online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People might not have pushed themselves as far as they would if they had an instructor in the room,\" Tiedemann said.\n\n\n\nYoga can't 'prevent falls forever'\n\nJean Leow runs Yoga Ink, teaching Iyengar to seniors in Sydney's south and in aged care facilities across the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I love working with seniors. When they come to a class, they really take it on and I'm surprised by how well they adapt,\" she said.\n\n\n\nJean Leow teaches Iyengar classes customised for the needs of her senior students. Source: Supplied / Jean Leow Leow said that while she appreciated the study looked at the effects of yoga over a whole year, rather than just a few weeks, she stressed it's up to the instructor to ensure the classes are tailored to the needs and abilities of each student if they want to see the benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can't emphasise enough the amount of customisation we as teachers have to be accountable for,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSue-ellen Kohler, who has been a yoga instructor for 30 years and teaches at Black Lotus in Sydney's inner-west, expressed concern that having the classes online may have influenced the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The teacher needs to actually look at how the body is working and how the body is using its muscles. Online, you don't get any of that. They're just going to be making shapes,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeow also said it's important to recognise the purpose of yoga isn't to \"prevent falls forever\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The aim is to help the older person understand what to do when they do fall, and how to correct themselves so they can arrest it and rebalance. That means they may still fall, but they're not going to hurt themselves in the process,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For my own students, some of them are avid travellers, some are gardeners. How do they recover from the things they love doing and protect their bodies enough to sustain their lifestyle?\"\n\n\n\nPreventing falls\n\nEvery day, 14 Australians aged 65 and over will die from a fall, according to the Falls, Balance and Injury Research Centre at Neuroscience Research Australia. A further 364 people will be hospitalised due to a fall each day.\n\n\n\nIn June, the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care updated its falls guidelines for the first time since 2009. It emphasised the benefits of exercise for older people, recommending that two to three hours of exercise per week is crucial in preventing falls. It stated that the primary targets should be balance, mobility, and strength.\n\n\n\n\n\nTiedemann said for people whose main aim is fall prevention, there is evidence to show that activities like Tai Chi and classes that focus on functional balance training can be effective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would not be promoting this type of yoga program for falls as the outcome, but it did have other benefits. People were more active and more likely to reach the goals they set,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe pointed out that some of the participants in the study enjoyed yoga so much they continued after the program ended.\n\n\n\n\n\nKirkwood, who is still recovering from her fall, believes yoga is still \"perfect\" for her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I wouldn't be like this without Iyengar. I've got a really good teacher.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Charlie Curnow is exploring his options but is contracted to the Blues. Credit: The Age Collingwood Draft picks: 34, 52, 64, 70\n\nKey players: Brody Mihocek, Mason Cox, Tom Mitchell, Bobby Hill Coach Craig McRae said he wanted a balance between securing established talent, while also having a good draft hand. Swans key forward Jack Buller is Magpies-bound on a two-year deal, and that should not be too complicated a trade, but they are not likely to pursue Demons defender Steven May. Jamie Elliott will stay, rejecting a three-year offer from the Suns to re-sign for two seasons, but Brody Mihocek is headed to Melbourne. Bobby Hill only recently signed a contract extension, but rival clubs have asked about him, after personal issues impacted the end of his season. Collingwood encouraged Mason Cox and Tom Mitchell to explore their options elsewhere. \u2013 Jon Pierik Essendon\n\nDraft picks: 4, 5, 22, 25\n\nKey players: Sam Draper, Zach Merrett Hawthorn wait with bated breath to see if the Bombers will trade captain Zach Merrett after his shock meeting with Hawks coach Sam Mitchell. The six-time club champion wants to play finals football and contend for flags, both of which have proven elusive at Essendon. Sam Draper has already announced he is leaving in free agency for Brisbane. The Bombers were aggressively pursuing in-demand Sun Sam Flanders but missed out, and are battling Port Adelaide for Gold Coast\u2019s free agent winger Brayden Fiorini. Hawks key defender Jai Serong is also a player of interest, while they could make a play for young Roo Zane Duursma, brother of Xavier. Delisted defender Jayden Laverde will sign with GWS post-draft. \u2013 Marc McGowan Sam Draper has played his last game for the Bombers. Credit: Getty Images Fremantle Draft picks: 11, 29, 38, 47, 65\n\nKey players: Will Brodie, Liam Reidy\n\nAfter being starved of opportunities, Will Brodie and Liam Reidy will head to Port Adelaide and Carlton, respectively, while speculation about Sean Darcy\u2019s future happens every year \u2013 and every season he stays. Fremantle have convinced mobile Melbourne defender Judd McVee to play alongside Jordan Clark, but will need to broker a trade with the Demons, who were disappointed to lose him. They are also open to trading their first pick in this year\u2019s heavily compromised draft, which will be pushed back by academy and father-son selections. \u2013 Peter Ryan Judd McVee is on his way out of Melbourne. Credit: AFL Photos Geelong Draft picks: 17, 35, 53, 71\n\nKey players: Rhys Stanley The Cats are bringing in ex-Hawk and local lad James Worpel on a four-year deal to add to their midfield depth. While Worpel is not an A-grader, Geelong\u2019s lack of midfield depth was obvious in the grand final. They are in the hunt for Charlie Curnow, the Blues forward keen for a fresh start, although a trade will be extremely complicated. St Kilda ruckman Rowan Marshall has requested a trade to the Cats, although the Saints have previously said they won\u2019t budge. It shapes as a fascinating trade period for Geelong, who want to remain in the premiership hunt. \u2013 Jon Pierik\n\nGeelong have landed James Worpel. Credit: AFL Photos Gold Coast Draft picks: 6, 13, 16, 31, 56, 67\n\nKey players: Connor Budarick, Sam Flanders, Bailey Humphrey, Malcolm Rosas jnr Champion Demon Christian Petracca has requested a trade to the Suns, and looms as the club\u2019s biggest recruit since Gary Ablett jnr. Now they need to appease Melbourne in a deal, and this is their priority over any potential Charlie Curnow pursuit, which is looking unlikely. Gold Coast are so far resisting making Bailey Humphrey available, but the forward-midfielder has interest from three clubs, including the Dees, who are also in a four-way race for Sam Flanders. Connor Budarick and Malcolm Rosas jnr requested trades to Western Bulldogs and Sydney, respectively, while Port Adelaide and Essendon are keen on free agent winger Brayden Fiorini. The Suns missed out on Jamie Elliott in free agency, but have met with troubled Bulldog Jamarra Ugle-Hagan and registered interest in contracted Swan James Rowbottom. \u2013 Marc McGowan GWS\n\nDraft picks: 12, 30, 32\n\nKey players: Jacob Wehr, Leek Aleer, Wade Derksen The Giants will ask for a first-round selection for Leek Aleer, but the Saints won\u2019t be handing one over easily despite the lucrative contract on offer, and the fact he played the final 13 matches in defence. Wade Derksen is in limbo; the Demons lost interest after trying to land him last season as he seeks more AFL opportunities, while Jacob Wehr is off to Port Adelaide as a free agent. Essendon\u2019s Jayden Laverde has joined the Giants, and they are interested in Demon Clayton Oliver, who has fallen out of favour. \u2013 Peter Ryan Hawthorn Draft picks: 8, 26, 55, 69\n\nKey players: James Worpel, Jai Serong, Henry Hustwaite, Cam Mackenzie Restricted free agent midfielder James Worpel has left for Geelong on a four-year deal, but Sam Butler resisted West Coast\u2019s strong interest to ink a new two-year deal. He will now hope for more midfield time. Jai Serong, who was hindered by the additions of Josh Battle and Tom Barrass this year, has been linked to North Melbourne, Essendon and Sydney. Cam Mackenzie played 12 games this year, and has interest from the Saints, while midfielder Henry Hustwaite had little opportunity this year, with Richmond among his suitors. \u2013 Jon Pierik\n\nLoading Melbourne Draft picks: 23, 53, 59\n\nKey players: Steven May, Judd McVee, Clayton Oliver, Christian Petracca, Charlie Spargo The Demons\u2019 flag-winning era is officially over, with coach Simon Goodwin sacked, Christian Petracca requesting a trade to Gold Coast, and both Steven May and Clayton Oliver encouraged to explore opportunities elsewhere. Charlie Spargo, who also played in the 2021 premiership, inked a free agency deal with North Melbourne, while wanted defender Judd McVee requested a trade home to Fremantle. Melbourne have lured Collingwood forward Brody Mihocek on a three-year deal, which could be via trade or free agency, while they hope to trade for St Kilda ruckman Max Heath. Beyond them, new coach Steven King has met with contracted Sun Bailey Humphrey. They are no longer interested in untried Giant Wade Derksen. \u2013 Marc McGowan North Melbourne\n\nDraft picks: 20, 21, 39, 57\n\nKey players: Jy Simpkin Contracted skipper Jy Simpkin wants more midfield time, but is yet to put in a trade request. If he did, the Kangaroos would drive a hard bargain for any suitors. Melbourne premiership forward Charlie Spargo joins as a free agent after an injury-riddled two seasons. An elite kick inside 50, Spargo is a handy, cheap addition if he can get on the park regularly. They are in the market for Hawks key defender Jai Serong after missing out on St Kilda\u2019s Marcus Windhager, who re-signed, and Gold Coast\u2019s Connor Budarick, who nominated the Western Bulldogs instead. \u2013 Peter Ryan Will the Roos lose their co-captain Jy Simpkin? Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Port Adelaide Draft picks: 24, 42, 60\n\nKey players: Zak Butters\n\nLoading It will be interesting to see how the Power position themselves heading into Josh Carr\u2019s maiden season in charge. Fremantle midfielder Will Brodie, contracted until the end of 2027, has requested a trade to Alberton, seeking greater opportunity. Giant Jacob Wehr, a running defender and wingman, has signed with the Power as an unrestricted free agent, while they are trying to convince Gold Coast\u2019s Brayden Fiorini to join them as a free agent. Silky midfielder Zak Butters will be a restricted free agent next year, but could be lured home to Victoria despite the Power and his manager insisting he will remain. He has been offered a two-year extension, plus a player option to extend it by a further six years, but he is yet to sign. \u2013 Jon Pierik Richmond Draft picks: 2, 3\n\nKey players: Tylar Young Much-improved defender Tylar Young requested a trade to West Coast after a strong second half of the season, in a blow to the Tigers, who remain in rebuilding mode and are unlikely to be overly active in the trade period. They missed out on Gold Coast goalsneak Malcolm Rosas jnr, who picked the Swans over them, but those are the cheap types they are most likely to target. Richmond are willing to trade their No.3 pick, which they acquired from North Melbourne, for the right deal after selecting seven players in the top 30 last year. \u2013 Marc McGowan\n\nRowan Marshall wants out of the Saints as Tom De Koning arrives. Credit: AFL Photos St Kilda Draft picks: 7, 43, 58\n\nKey players: Rowan Marshall, Jack Steele, Callum Wilkie All-Australian defender Callum Wilkie entertained a serious offer from the Bulldogs before deciding not to push for a trade with two years remaining on his contract. Rowan Marshall might reach Geelong, but there is plenty of water to go under the bridge, while skipper Jack Steele is set to stay, too, despite the Saints encouraging him to look around. St Kilda have landed free agents Tom De Koning and Jack Silvagni, and have the Giants\u2019 Leek Aleer and West Coast\u2019s Liam Ryan wanting to join them. The Suns\u2019 Sam Flanders has nominated them as his new home \u2013 the No.7 pick is likely what gets the deal done. It\u2019s an unprecedented opening of the piggy bank as they attempt to return to premiership contention. It may lose them Marshall. \u2013 Peter Ryan Sydney\n\nDraft picks: 9, 27, 45, 63\n\nKey players: James Rowbottom Gold Coast forward Malcolm Rosas jnr has chosen Sydney as his preferred new home, but it\u2019s Charlie Curnow whom the Swans dearly want. The star Blue has three clubs he is keen to get to \u2013 Gold Coast, Geelong or Sydney. However, as the Cats said, it\u2019s going to take something special to get a deal done for a man who is contracted to Carlton until the end of 2029. The Swans delisted Aaron Francis and Robbie Fox, who are now on the Giants\u2019 radar. James Rowbottom is contracted for three more seasons, but the Suns are interested in the tough midfielder. \u2013 Jon Pierik Malcolm Rosas has nominated the Swans as his preferred new home. Credit: AFL Photos West Coast Draft picks: 1, 15, 19, 33, 51\n\nKey players: Oscar Allen, Tyler Brockman, Campbell Chesser, Liam Ryan\n\nLoading It has already been an eventful off-season for the wooden-spooners, with Richmond defender Tylar Young requesting a trade west and dual premiership-winning Lions defender Brandon Starcevich agreeing to join them as well. The Eagles plan to trade for Starcevich instead of signing him in free agency, to avoid diluting their compensation for Allen leaving for Brisbane. The AFL awarded West Coast an end-of-first-round selection as part of an assistance package, which could be the key piece in trading for Starcevich. Campbell Chesser and All-Australian forward Liam Ryan requested trades to Carlton and St Kilda, respectively. Close friend Ryan\u2019s impending exit could lead to Tyler Brockman exploring his options as well. \u2013 Marc McGowan Western Bulldogs Draft picks: 10, 28\n\nKey players: Buku Khamis, Jamarra Ugle-Hagan The Bulldogs made a big offer to St Kilda\u2019s Callum Wilkie in a long-shot attempt to prise him out of the Saints as they seek to bolster their defence, but he is set to stay after a pay rise. Buku Khamis wants a trade to the Blues, while Jamarra Ugle-Hagan has almost certainly played his last match for the club. He will either be traded to the Suns on a new contract or take a long road back to the AFL. The Dogs also landed the big body they were after, with the Suns\u2019 Connor Budarick asking to be traded to the Kennel. But they missed out on Deven Robertson, who chose West Coast instead as his preferred new home. \u2013 Peter Ryan",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size In the beginning, Victoria\u2019s south-west coastline was formless and empty, submerged by the ocean. Darkness cloaked the surface of the deep. Not for long. The Earth cooled. Far to the south, glaciers formed. The skirts of the ocean were pulled back, revealing a coastline of striped yellow limestone. And then, over a few thousand years, waves and wind did their work, battering the shoreline into a dramatic form of environmental stonemasonry. A view of the Twelve Apostles, which remains a popular tourist attraction. Credit: Nicole Cleary Today, we call it the Twelve Apostles \u2013 a natural formation that continues to draw millions of tourists from across the country, and the world. There was a time when at least 13 limestone pillars were part of the natural formation. Five of those pillars now sit below the water, gaining the term the \u201cdrowned apostles\u201d by researchers. The last apostle to drown came crashing down in 2005, leaving just seven standing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCoastline experts say it is a matter of when and not if the next sea stack crumbles into the ocean. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if one fell down next week,\u201d says David Kennedy, a professor of coastal geomorphology at the University of Melbourne. \u201cI do wonder if I\u2019ll see one collapse each time I visit there.\u201d Despite their collapsing state, the Twelve Apostles remain a popular tourism attraction. Credit: Nicole Cleary Anticipation of the next collapse is against a backdrop of debate about whether visitors should be charged to view the natural attraction while surrounding geological wonders remain closed to the public due to concerns about coastal erosion. Last week, the Great Ocean Road Regional Tourism group and local council called for the introduction of a visitor payment scheme to maintain facilities and help protect the fragile coastline. The push comes after the state government announced completion of a rooftop structure last month as part of a new $126 million visitor centre being built in a redevelopment of the area. The centre will also include shops, eateries and a garden.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrincetown resident Dion Webber has been flagging concerns about water discharge at the Twelve Apostles and access closures at nearby sites, including Gibson Steps, Loch Ard Gorge and The Arch. Webber worries that construction work at the Twelve Apostles tourism site is contributing to cliff instability. And he says the closures result in a poorer experience for tourists, who make the trip to the south-west coast, as well as locals. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible to see all this happening,\u201d Webber says. Dion Webber has been raising concerns with water runoff at the Twelve Apostles site. Credit: Nicole Cleary Richard Riordan, Liberal MP for Polwarth, which covers the south-west, says the closure of so many of the area\u2019s tourist sites calls into question the value visitors receive, particularly if they will be charged to visit in future. \u201cThis is such a lost opportunity. It\u2019s such an important part of Victoria\u2019s tourism offer,\u201d he says. \u201cSadly, it\u2019s at risk of being a huge white elephant.\u201d Riordan says the government spending on the Twelve Apostles redevelopment is not commensurate with the condition of the sites, which he argues have been poorly managed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, a state government spokeswoman says the Twelve Apostles redevelopment will transform the destination, ensuring it is safer and easier to experience while encouraging people to stay longer in the region. She says no decisions have been made about charging visitors. A spokesman for the Great Ocean Road Coast and Parks Authority says Gibson Steps will reopen soon and Loch Ard Gorge is still a great place to visit with a new blowhole lookout now open. The authority confirmed it is investigating feasibility options for stairs at Loch Ard Gorge. It is also considering the effect of rain and stormwater volume entering the drainage system from the Twelve Apostles visitor centre site. Asking whether more apostles will fall down misunderstands the landmark, scientists say. They are constantly in the process of eroding and collapsing. \u201cWe are looking at a snapshot in time of 6000 years of the coast retreating,\u201d says Kennedy. \u201cThey are a geographical quirk.\u201d The coastline around Port Campbell was laid down hundreds of millions of years ago, when sea levels were tens of metres higher and the area was a shallow marine bay known as the Otway Basin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwarms of shellfish and single-celled protozoans were born, lived and died here, their shells laid down in sediment that eventually became rich yellow limestone. The sea gradually retreated, no longer sitting atop the rock but now chiselling at its edges. Some rock is too hard to be eroded, like the shoreline at Wilsons Promontory. Some is so soft it could not support the weight of a stack and crumbles away to a cliff-face, like those at Anglesea. Loch Ard Gorge where there have been some access closures. Credit: Nicole Cleary Here, the limestone is just soft enough to weather slowly, but with enough strength to hold up hundreds of tonnes of rock. \u201cThe sea eats at them, and eventually, they fall,\u201d says associate professor Stephen Gallagher, a micropalaeontologist at the University of Melbourne. The problem is predicting just when that collapse might happen.\n\nAdvertisement",
