        "text": "The co-founder of one of Australia's most popular breweries has struck gold with a secondary endeavour: non-alcoholic beer.\n\nJaz Wearin and her husband Grant began Modus Operandi in 2014 on Sydney's Northern Beaches with just $7 and a dream.\n\nJust six years later, the pair noticed the booming zero per cent market in Australia was crying out for more competition.\n\nJaz Wearin founded Nort in 2020. (Supplied)\n\nThey boldly entered the non-alcoholic craft beer category during the COVID-19 pandemic with the launch of Nort.\n\nAt this point, zero per cent beer was still a largely unexplored market.\ufeff\n\nNow, a few years later, Nort has opened its own brewery to bump out its non-alcoholic beverages.\ufeff\n\n\"Since we launched in 2020, the response has been incredible,\" Wearon told nine.com.au.\n\n\"In the early years, demand grew explosively, so much so that we built our own 10 million-litre brewery to keep pace.\"\n\nThere has been a generational shift in alcohol consumption in Australia since Nort launched.\n\nNon-alcoholic beer now accounts for 10 per cent of beer sales in Australia.\n\nThe national non-alcohol category is also expected to deliver double-digit growth by 2028, with a prediction of around 300 million litres sold that year compared to 150 million in 2024.\n\nWearon said Australians had been desperate for ways to stay sober and remain social.\n\n\"It really comes down to choice and balance, people want to enjoy social occasions without the downsides of alcohol all the time,\" she said of Nort's success.\n\n\"That might be for health, sleep, fitness, work performance, family commitments, or just wanting a clearer head the next day.\n\n\"Our slogan, 'Enjoy More', really captures that: it's not about giving up, it's about enjoying more of life without having to compromise the social experience.\"\n\nNon-alcoholic beer now accounts for 10 per cent of beer sales in Australia. (Supplied)\n\nWhile the Australian market is still small, Wearon is confident it will be a huge 2026 for brands in this category.\n\nNort is competing against the likes of Heaps Normal , Hahn, Asahi and \ufeffCarlton for space on the non-alcoholic shelf.\n\nBut the home-grown brand is the little engine that could: the sales have proven this.\ufeff\n\n\ufeffWearon said January sales are typically several times higher than other months as New Year's resolutions kick in.\n\n\"It's very predictable now,\" she said of the January sales bump.\n\n\"In fact, this year we had higher demand than we forecasted, and we were literally brewing Nort up until Christmas Eve to keep up.\n\n\"Christmas and the 'silly season' brings a lot of social occasions, so people use non-alcoholic beer as a way to enjoy the moments without the downside of overindulging.\n\n\"Then in January, we see that behaviour really kick in, people deliberately choose to cut back or reset after the holidays.\"\n\nWearin said Australians are looking for ways to stay sober and remain social. (Supplied)\n\nBut sales are no longer tied to big \"sober\" movements like Dry July, she said.\n\nIn fact, non-alcoholic sales now mirror traditional beer sales.\n\n\"\ufeffWhat we're seeing now is that non-alc beer is mirroring the broader beer cycle, where growth isn't just tied to Dry January or Feb Fast anymore,\" she added.\n\n\"It's becoming ingrained in people's behaviours around the key drinking occasions like footy finals, Christmas, summer holidays, and Easter too.\"",

(ABC News: Scott Jewell)\n\nScrapers, some paint, and a passion for history\n\nMr Slocum's creative whim sprouted a personal campaign to restore every pillar box in the state.\n\nAfter hearing about his first refurb, Australia Post offered Mick payment for every completed pillar. A supplier also provides paint.\n\nWithout any modern tools, he's scratched, scraped and painted pillars throughout Melbourne and across regional Victoria.\n\nEach refurb takes between a couple of days and several weeks.\n\nIt's a task undertaken in the heat and cold, and along roads busy or quiet \u2014 and one that reliably draws curious onlookers, as well as offers to help.\n\n\"The gentleman whose [Albert Park] house I'm working out the front of came out and greeted me like a long-lost brother,\" Mr Slocum said.\n\n\"That's actually the best part \u2014 meeting the people.\"\n\nMick Slocum's restorations bring vibrant colour to Victorian streetscapes. (Supplied: Mick Slocum)\n\nSecrets hidden beneath the surface\n\nPillar boxes were introduced in Australia in the 1850s.\n\nMany were produced in several different styles at foundries in Melbourne.\n\nPillar boxes were key to communication in a time before the telephone and, along roads where cars and trams now zip by, horse-mounted postmen would have stopped multiple times a day to empty each one.\n\n\"The juxtaposition of what [an area] used to be like and what it is now is just extraordinary,\" Mr Slocum said.\n\n\"I'm kind of bringing that back in a way \u2014 that's the magic of it.\"\n\nWhen the pillars were decommissioned, starting in the 1960s, they were sealed shut and were slathered with a bland, red coat of paint.\n\nIt's this dull coating Mick first shaves away before sanding and eventually returning the pillars back to their original colours \u2014 usually bright red, gold, and green.\n\nThe strips that come away with every scrape of Mick's knife can hint at a pillar's secret past: often revealing layers of colours which have been hidden for decades.\n\nAnd some discoveries beneath the topcoat can be breathtaking.\n\nMick's fascinating finds in the past year include a delicate golden crown painted on a pillar box in Collingwood, which he believed was likely added ahead of Queen Elizabeth's visit in 1954.\n\nIn Jolimont, Mick uncovered a notice for collection times \u2014 which he estimated dated from the 1920s.\n\n\"But it could have even been from the 1800s,\" Mr Slocum said.\n\nScraping away the thick top coat on the pillars can reveal hidden secrets. (Supplied: Mick Slocum)\n\nBoxes on the decline\n\nThere are about 180 pillar boxes in Victoria, but there were once thousands.\n\nAnd it's not just the historic boxes that have disappeared from street corners.\n\nWith the rise of the internet and telephones, sending a letter has largely become a thing of the past and the number of modern post boxes has declined as well.\n\nAustralia Post has removed some receiving boxes in recent years.\n\nIn May 2025, Mick received a National Trust conservation award for his work in Ballarat \u2014 where he's refurbished 16 pillar boxes.\n\n\"He's provided a real highlight of the joy that heritage can spark in people's lives,\" said Sam Westbrook, executive manager of conservation and advocacy at National Trust.\n\n70 down, 100 to go\n\nMick's nearly halfway to his target and has about 100 pillar box restorations to go.\n\nBut his unshakable passion for the colourful and creative means he already has his sights on his next project \u2014 once he's signed off on the final pillar box.\n\n\"In the CBD on every street corner there's an electricity box from the 1920s and 1930s,\" he said.\n\n\"So far I've restored two, and there are about 50 to go.\"\n\nMick Slocum scrapes, scratches and paints pillar boxes across Victoria (ABC News: Scott Jewell)\n\nFor now, he's focused on the main task \u2014 a project taken one pillar at a time.\n\n\"I always hope that one day I'll find a key that opens one of the boxes, and it'll be full of mail from the 1890s,\" Mr Slocum said with wide eyes and an eager smile.\n\n\"You just never know.\"",

The moment Talia Gibson booked her place in the second round J By Jon Healy Local wildcard Talia Gibson is the first winner of the 2026 Australian Open J By Jon Healy (Getty) Australian wildcard Talia Gibson is through to the second round of her home slam for the second straight year with a decisive 6-1, 6-3 victory over Russian Anna Blinkova in just 76 minutes. Gibson was fearless and finished the match by ripping a 43rd winner across the court (Blinkova only had five). It's a phenomenal victory for Gibson, who is ranked 119th, 57 spots below Blinkova.

The Italian has been struggling a little physically and certainly looked out of sorts. It's also been a weird match with a video review for a net touch and a let played after an underarm serve because the ballkid was moving behind Cobolli.

The match is just over an hour old and she leads Blinkova 6-1, 4-3 thanks largely to a 33-5 advantage in winners, but she's just been broken for the first time and the unforced errors are mounting now too (20-12). Gibson missed a chance to go up 5-1 on Blinkova's serve and has started missing a few more serves and she's getting a little rushed as Blinkova finds her rhythm.

She's just demolished world number 62 Anna Blinkova with gutsy groundstrokes and nerveless play, ripping 13 winners to 2 and winning 88 per cent of her first-serve points (albeit only landing it 40 per cent of the time). When is Alex Eala playing? J By Jon Healy You able to also report on Alex Eala? - Rey Hi Rey, We will report on Alex Eala, but the 20-year-old from the Philippines isn't playing until Monday. She starts her campaign against American Alycia Parks in the second match on court six tomorrow. Live: Clutch from Talia Gibson J By Jon Healy (Getty) If Talia Gibson is nervous about playing at her home grand slam for just the third time, she isn't showing it. The 21-year-old is crushing her groundstrokes and nailing serves on big points, saving two break points in her second service game, then breaking again to extend her first-set lead over Anna Blinkova to 4-1. The 27-year-old Russian is not only ranked 62nd as opposed to Gibson's 119, she has also played almost twice as many singles matches on tour.

        "text": "A whistle rings out. Evening is falling, and it's time for the people of the Torres Strait to abide by their night-time curfew.\n\nIt was almost a century ago that the call of the \"bu\", or trumpet shell, controlled the lives of those across the islands of the Torres Strait.\n\nOnce used by chiefs to call men to battle, the bu, as it was known, became a tool of oppression.\n\nThe pearling industry dominated the Torres Strait economy in 1936. (State Library of Queensland)\n\nThat was, until January 1936, when Torres Strait Islanders decided they had had enough of the discrimination they suffered working on pearling boats.\n\nThey went on strike.\n\nThis week, Governor-General Sam Mostyn attended a ceremony on Thursday Island commemorating the 90th anniversary of the strike.\n\nMs Mostyn said the story \"has not really manifested itself in a way that others have historically for Australia\".\n\nNed David (right) and Torres Strait mayors led a parade on Thursday Island commemorating the maritime strike. (Supplied: Duncan Bain)\n\n\"It shouldn't have taken 90 years to really reflect on this and to learn from what happened in the 1930s and think about how that did shape other things across the country,\" she said.\n\n\"We know a lot about the Wave Hill Walk-Off and the Gurindji people, we know about the Mabo decision and native title, but the thing that has struck me is this story has so much extraordinary background to it.\n\n\"I think what we saw [on Thursday Island this week] was the pride in what happened in the 1930s.\n\n\"There are many family members, descendants of those strikers, who knew how tough it was to live at that time.\"\n\nOppression and control\n\nBack then, the Queensland Government Protector controlled the lives of Torres Strait Islanders, dictating where they could go, how they worked and how they got paid.\n\nFor most, that work was in the pearling industry.\n\n\"A chap by the name of J.D. McLean took up post here in the late [19]20s and started putting some of these new, really restrictive suppressive laws in place,\" said Ned David, chairman of the Torres Strait Islander land and sea council known as Gur A Baradharaw Kod.\n\nNed David reflects on the legacy of the maritime strike. (ABC Far North: Brendan Mounter)\n\nThe Torres Strait supplied much of the global demand for pearls, and the industry employed most of the archipelago's workforce.\n\nWhile some Islanders worked on so-called \"master's boats\", owned by European or Japanese pearlers, many were employed on \"company\" boats controlled by the Queensland Government Protector.\n\nThe company's boat system was restrictive and paid lower wages.\n\nIn many cases, they did not receive cash but credit that could be spent only at designated government stores.\n\nMcLean wanted to boost production on the company boats, but his oppressive approach sparked a revolt with ramifications far beyond pearling.\n\nMichael O'Shane is a long-serving member of the Maritime Union of Australia. (ABC Far North: Brendan Mounter)\n\nMichael O'Shane, whose grandmother used to dive for trochus shells around Masig Island, has heard family stories about the \"invasive, exploitative\" regime of the protector days.\n\n\"They were only paid with flour, sugar and tobacco and stuff like that,\" he said.\n\n\"[Torres Strait Islanders] built the luggers, they owned and operated the luggers, but it was at the protector's discretion on the administration of it, the working of it, the crewing of it, how they were paid.\"\n\nTorres Strait Islanders' money and movement were strictly controlled by a Queensland Government Protector. (State Library of Queensland)\n\nMore than just money\n\nBy January 1936, the Torres Strait Islanders had enough.\n\nWhen McLean went around trying to sign up workers for the company boats, Torres Strait Islanders refused, jumping out of meeting hall windows in protest.\n\nThe strike made headlines in the Cairns and Brisbane dailies, and after nine months, McLean was removed from his post and replaced by another protector.\n\nThe nightly curfew was scrapped, and Torres Strait Islander pearlers were given more pay, control of their own boats and more freedom to travel between islands without the need for permission.\n\n\"You can only imagine back then, with limited means of communication \u2014 there was nothing like a telephone or anything \u2014 how people were able to organise themselves to basically synchronise the strike to take place at almost the same time across the entire region,\" Mr David said.\n\n\"It's very interesting to know that our people came together, sat down and said 'we're not going to take this anymore,'\" Mr O'Shane said.\n\nPearl racks off Friday Island are one of the remaining signs of a once-massive industry that boomed across the Torres Strait. (Nikolai Beilharz: ABC Rural)\n\n\"We stand on those shoulders today.\"\n\nMr O'Shane, a maritime worker and unionist, said the actions of his ancestors resonated with the broader Australian value of a fair go.\n\n\"It exposed the situation to the world, what was happening to the First Nations people of his country,\" he said.",

(ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nBrain cancer missing out on funding\n\nClinical trials of new treatments can offer hope to cancer patients, but Dr Harrup said funding for them is limited.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that if you live in a major capital city and you have brain cancer you are much more likely to be able to enrol in a clinical trial than if you live in country Victoria or Tasmania,\" she said.\n\nBrain cancer's survival rates have changed little over the past 30 years and is the cancer that kills the most children in Australia. (ABC News: Andy Cunningham)\n\nBrain Tumour Alliance Australia has been mapping the burden and economic cost of brain cancer in Australia, which in 2025 was $850 million.\n\nIf trends continue the mapping estimates the cost at $3.2 billion by 2050.\n\nIt's hoped the mapping will unite the brain cancer community and fundraising efforts, and make research and funding a government priority.\n\nJustine leafs through a scrapbook for Abbey, her tattoo tribute visible on her wrist. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nThe alliance is asking the federal government for $200 million over 10 years for brain cancer research and trials, and up to $10 million to improve clinical care for patients, including funding for specialised nurses.\n\n\"The burdens and impacts are disproportionately high, the complexity of the disease is disproportionately high, but our funding and policy approach to address that complexity is mismatched,\" Mr Cardinal said.\n\nCraig Cardinal is one of those heading the campaign to lobby for more money to fight the disease. (ABC News: Mark Moore)\n\nThe Alliance said direct research funding for brain cancer has consistently lagged behind other cancers.\n\nIt states that from 2003 to 2020 brain cancer received $111.6 million in total project funding \u2014 well below breast cancer ($431.6 million) and leukaemia ($234.7 million).\n\nIn 2017 the Australian Brain Cancer Mission invested $126 million over 10 years for brain cancer research, $50 million came from government, while $76 million was from philanthropic organisations.\n\n\"I'm certainly committed to doing more \u2026 as that mission comes to an end. We've already started discussions with the Brain Cancer Alliance about what that looks like,\" said federal Health Minister Mark Butler.\n\nMark Butler says the government is \"working as hard as we can\" to get cancer drugs on the PBS \"as quickly as possible\". (ABC News: Rebecca Trigger)\n\n\"In the meantime whenever there are new treatments, particularly for children with brain cancer, we're working as hard as we can to get those medicines available to families on the PBS as quickly as possible.\n\n\" This is a stubborn area of cancer where I think every country, including ours, wants to see improvement. \"\n\nDr Harrup said \"talking about a cure is important because that's what we strive for and that's what our mission is.\"\n\n\"For those patients we can't cure right here and now, improving quality of life and quantity of life are both very, very meaningful goals,\" she said.",

        "text": "Inside the prestigious Brisbane City Hall in the countdown to the 2032 Olympic Games, thumping music shakes the walls where almost 200 breakdancers from across 33 countries have gathered to compete.\n\nThis weekend's World Dancesport Federation competition is part of the bid to secure the sport's presence at the 2032 Brisbane Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nBenmx has been breaking since his family moved to Queensland in 2015. (Supplied)\n\nAmongst the talented competitors is a group of Australian athletes determined to define their own Olympic image, emerging from the shadow cast by Raygun at the last Games.\n\n\"It was just that small snippet: there's so much more to breaking,\" said Benji Cogdell-Baird, acclaimed on an international stage as Benmx.\n\nThe 18-year-old has been breaking since his family moved to Queensland from South Australia when he was seven.\n\nBenmx says breaking gave him an outlet when his brother was ill. (Supplied)\n\n\"When we moved up here, my brother had a cardiac arrest. At the time, it was very stressful for my parents having to manage all of that,\" he said.\n\n\"They put me in the sport to take my mind off all the things that were happening.\n\n\"They put me in the sport to take my mind off all the things that were happening,\" Benmx says. (Supplied)\n\n\"It was explosive and powerful. I just ended up falling in love with it straight away.\"\n\nThe Gold Coast teenager said he wanted more Australians to feel that passion for a sport that was not \"too exposed\" on home soil.\n\nBenmx was born in South Australia but now calls the Gold Coast home. (ABC News: Lucy Loram)\n\n\"I'd like to show the world that it's such an entertaining sport and it's like none other. When was the last time you saw [someone] spinning on their head?\"\n\nThe teenager wants more Australians to feel the passion. (Supplied)\n\n'Individual personalities and flavours'\n\nThe words 'Australian breakdancer' became tied to one notable performer in 2024, when Raygun hopped around the Olympic stage in green and gold. She failed to score any points in her three bouts in Paris.\n\nThe routines made international headlines, but general secretary of DanceSport Australia Luke Brown said it was time for other Olympic and non-Olympic breakers to take over the spotlight.\n\n\"Paris 2024 was an amazing success for breaking. Raygun represented Australia, and she went forward and bought what she thought was her best performance,\" he said.\n\nLuke Brown says breaking deserves its place in the Olympics. (ABC News: Lucy Loram)\n\n\" But we're moving forward in a way that showcases all of our athletes and their own individual personalities and flavours. \"\n\nProfessional breaker J-Attack, otherwise known as Jeff Dunne, had a taste of the Olympic limelight at the Paris Games.\n\n\"Just being able to represent Australia at one of the highest sporting areas is such an honour and such a privilege,\" he said.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nWith five billion people watching the Paris Olympics two years ago, Mr Dunne said he was hopeful that breaking could reach similar audiences from Brisbane in six years' time.\n\n\"I'd like Australia to understand the difference between watching breaking and seeing it live,\" he said.\n\n\"It also allows competitors to travel across the world to meet new people that share the same experience as you, who have put in all that hard work and discipline.\"\n\n17-year-old Guo Pu from China, who is ranked number one in world youth under the stage name B-Girl Royal, said the lively art form was active across the world, including in Australia.\n\n\"I don't think there is a big difference in communities because we are altogether dancing for our love of this sport and art form,\" she said.\n\n\"We hope to invite more people to experience and appreciate breaking.\"\n\nMr Brown said fresh talent were accepting that invitation, within the scope of World DanceSport Federation competitions.\n\n\"We're seeing an increase of participation across the country, we're not seeing a decrease,\" he said.\n\n\"We're seeing an increase of registrations worldwide and in Australia as well.\"\n\nJeff 'J-Attack' Dunne represented Australia in the 2024 Olympics for breaking. (Reuters: Angelika Warmuth)\n\nOlympic prospects\n\nBreaking was one of many sports vying to be selected by the international Olympic and Paralympic committees for the 2032 program.\n\nWhy Raygun hit a nerve There's an elite club of Olympic losers who we love to celebrate. A year on from Raygun's infamous performance, Australian Story investigates why she isn't one of them.\n\n\"We are focused on designing a sport programme that reflects the values of the Olympic and Paralympic Movements, is operationally viable, and supports Brisbane 2032's commercial, sustainable and engagement and experience objectives,\" said a Brisbane 2032 spokesperson.\n\nWith the sport not featuring in the 2028 Los Angeles Games, its fate in Brisbane will be decided by the committees later this year.\n\nPresident of the World DanceSport Federation, Shawn Tay, said the weekend's competition in Brisbane was a positive sign that Australia had an appetite for global breakdancing performances.\n\n\"This is perhaps the most important event before the Olympic Games Committee makes its decision to include new sports in Brisbane 2032,\" Mr Tay said.\n\n\"Many of our top athletes are here, including many young world champions, to showcase what they do best in breaking.\"",

She did not start stage one because of her injuries.\n\nThen inside the last couple of kilometres on Saturday, a crash took out Roseman-Gannon and several teammates.\n\nGeorgia Baker was left with a bloodied knee and has been withdrawn from the second stage.\n\n\"All the riders have been through their fair share of crashes in their careers, so when you walk away like this \u2026 it can be a lot worse,\" team manager Jess Allen said.\n\n\"It's not what you want, but we also have two days ahead and two new opportunities to turn things around.\"\n\nThe Tour will continue on Sunday with the 130.7km stage from suburban Norwood to Paracombe in the Adelaide Hills.\n\nWollaston probably will not retain the overall lead given the climbing involved on Sunday, but she is determined to make opponents work for it.\n\n\"I will try and do it justice \u2014 it would be rude not to,\" she said.\n\n\"You have to respect a jersey like this in the WorldTour. We'll do everything tomorrow as a team to keep this jersey in the team.\"\n\nDespite being overtaken so close to the finish, Vigilia was also upbeat about her form and settling into her new team.\n\n\"It's really nice to feel that we work well. It's hard to arrive here and adapt to the jet lag and heat,\" she said.\n\n\"So this is a good sign that we are prepared and we will show it again.\"\n\nAAP",

        "text": "Every year, Double J counts down the Hottest 100 from 20 years ago.\n\nIt's a chance for some of us to reminisce about simpler times, and for younger music fans to discover songs that might have slipped through the cracks.\n\nIt's not that these tracks aren't great \u2014 far from it \u2014 but with thousands of tunes released every year, even the best can fade from memory.\n\nThese 10 really struck us when looking at the full list from the 2005 Hottest 100, and we want to share them with you.\n\nWe're not saying your memory's shot. We just want to bring these gems back into your life.\n\nSo, settle in and get ready to revisit some of the highlights from a truly great year in music.\n\nThe Bloodhound Gang \u2014 Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo (#24)\n\nThe title, Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo, sues the NATO phonetic alphabet to communicate the song's subject matter. (Supplied: Geffen Records)\n\nYouTube | Spotify | Apple Music\n\nSix years after cracking the Hottest 100 top 10 with The Bad Touch \u2014 whose words were deeply etched into the minds of every 2000s schoolyard kid \u2014 The Bloodhound Gang returned to the countdown with Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo in 2005.\n\nThough it capitalises on the same sexual innuendo schtick, can you dig up a single line from the memory bank? I sure as heck can't.\n\nThe track's generic alt-rock and music video \u2014 featuring bikini models with power tools and Bam Margera driving a banana car through a tunnel \u2014 have not aged well. But the song's various slang for intercourse (\"Marinate the nether rod in the squish mitten\u2026 Batter dip the cranny ax in the gut locker\") can still elicit a chuckle or two.\n\nAl Newstead\n\nArchitecture in Helsinki \u2014 It'5! (#56)\n\nIt'5! was a highlight of Architecture In Helsinki's dazzling second album (Inertia Music)\n\nYouTube | Spotify | Apple Music\n\nThey ended up reaching far greater heights, including two spots in the Hottest 100 top 20 in following years, but It'5! gave Architecture In Helsinki their first ever spot in the Hottest 100.\n\nThe song was a highlight of In Case We Die, the second album from the Melbourne pop experimentalists, and sounded like nothing else in the countdown.\n\nThis nonlinear blast of chamber pop jumps around a lot, packing chorus vocals, brass sections, nursery rhyme chanting, and lots of handclaps into a tight two-minute package.\n\nYou might still have Escapee or Heart It Races on your playlists \u2014 now it's time to get reacquainted with It'5! \u2014 a sugar hit you won't regret.\n\nDan Condon\n\nThe Bravery \u2014 An Honest Mistake (#48)\n\nAn Honest Mistake would be the first and last time The Bravery made the Hottest 100. (Supplied: Island/UMG)\n\nYouTube | Spotify | Apple Music\n\nI can still recall this tune's chorus \u2014 heck, even this NYC band's solid self-titled album and its cover! But I imagine for most folks, An Honest Mistake would simply trigger reactions of 'oh yeah, those guys\u2026'\n\nSpringing up in the wake of The Killers's breakthrough debut album Hot Fuss, The Bravery hewed so closely to the same new wave inspired indie rock sound that Killers frontman Brandon Flowers accused them of ripping him off.\n\n\"They're signed because we're a band,\" Flowers told MTV at the time. \"I can see The Strokes play [and] it's real, and I haven't gotten that from The Bravery. I think people will see through them.\"\n\nHis trash-talking sparked a feudal back-and-forth with The Bravery's Morrissey-but-make-it-punk singer Sam Endicott. It's safe to say The Killers won the war.\n\nThe Bravery stopped releasing records by the end of the 2010s. Though they did play a one-off reunion show in 2021 alongside, strangely, Tame Impala, with a set featuring, stranger still, covers of Fugazi, Descendents and Black Flag.\n\nAl Newstead\n\nLittle Birdy \u2014 Six Months In A Leaky Boat (#96)\n\nSix Months In A Leaky Boat was also the b-side of Little Birdy's Come On Come On single.\n\nYouTube | Spotify | Apple Music\n\nWe were still a little way off from the dominance of Like A Versions, but one particular set of covers proved very popular in the 2005 countdown.\n\nWe know you haven't forgotten Little Birdy. The band are Hottest 100 royalty and the mid 2000s was when they were really at the height of their powers.\n\nSome people may, however, have forgotten She Will Have Her Way, a tribute to Neil and Tim Finn that had a bit of an impact of the Hottest 100 of 2005.\n\nLittle Birdy gave us a faithful take on the Split Enz classic, retaining its energy and idiosyncrasies while putting their own sonic stamp on things.\n\nKaty Steele is outstanding out the front, the perfect voice to nail those incredibly high notes while her band deftly navigate the tricky arrangement.\n\nWith Split Enz reforming for shows in 2026, there's no better time to reacquaint yourself with this version. And it's part of the newly reformed band's setlist\n\nDan Condon\n\nEmiliana Torrini \u2014 Sunny Road (#44)\n\nmilana Torrini's fourth album, Fisherman's Woman managed to crack the ARIA top 100. (Supplied: Rough Trade)\n\nYouTube | Spotify | Apple Music\n\nPersonally, this was a case of a pleasurable refresher, largely because my mother was a fan (shout out Trish)!\n\nFramed as a letter to a lost lover, Sunny Road is a whimsical slice of folk where guitar and keys swirl around Torrini's soft voice yet staunch lyrics. 'I never married, never had those kids / I loved too many, now heaven's closed it gates,\" she sings. \"Some things don't change, my middle name's still 'risk'\".\n\nIt remains the Icelandic singer-songwriter's most popular song (alongside Jungle Drum) but turns out she's got a fascinating wrap sheet.\n\nA member of Reykjav\u00edk electronic collective GusGus before going solo, Torrini won an Ivor Novello Award for co-writing Kylie Minogue's slinky 2003 hit Slow. That was a year after she sang Gollum's Song for movie blockbuster The Lord of the Rings: The Towers.\n\nHer fourth album Fisherwoman's Woman, from which Sunny Road is lifted, was produced by Dan Carey \u2014 the esteemed UK producer best known for manning records for Fontaines D.C., Wet Leg, Black Midi, Squid and others. The more you know!\n\nAl Newstead\n\nScissor Sisters \u2014 Filthy/Gorgeous (#83)\n\nThe eponymous Scissor Sisters album cracked the top 10 in the Australian ARIA Album Charts. (Supplied: Polydor)\n\nYouTube | Spotify | Apple Music\n\nThere was a time it was difficult to escape these glam rock revivalists. Singles like the Elton John-adjacent hoedown Take Your Mama, for instance, or the discoteque rework of Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb that caught everyone's attention to begin with.\n\nHowever, Filthy/Gorgeous is a deeper cut from the group's debut album that might've slipped you by. It might not be as memorable, but it's got all the Scissor Sister hallmarks \u2014 the Bee Gees falsetto of Jake Shears, irreverent pop lyricism, and throbbing disco groove (that recalls, of all things, Super Mario Bros.)\n\nAl Newstead\n\nThe Butterfly Effect \u2014 Phoenix (#33)\n\nPhoenix never made a Butterfly Effect album but its their second-highest ever charting in the Hottest 100. (Supplied: The Butterfly Effect) ]\n\nYouTube | Spotify | Apple Music\n\nProg-leaning Australian hard rock was really having a moment in 2005, as evidenced by several Hottest 100 entries. Perth had Karnivool. Byron Bay had J Award nominees COG. And Brisbane? They had The Butterfly Effect.\n\nNow, I can remember triple j spinning their Deftones-esque 2001 song The Cell. And even 2003 debut album Begins Here. But apologies, it's a complete blur after that. Phoenix was a B-side and later live fan fave that missed out making the tracklist for the band's next album (Imago, 2006).\n\nIt holds up okay in 2025, even if the rap-rock backing grunts feel very time-and-place. Despite The Butterfly Effect remaining active, Phoenix hasn't appeared in a setlist since 2018 \u2014 so much for a 'rising from the ashes' rebirth.\n\nAl Newstead\n\nHear the Hottest 100 of 2005 replayed on Double J on Sunday 25 January.",

(FIS Snowboard: David Tributsch)\n\nThe thumping win was a big boost for four-time Olympian James, who will be aiming to better the bronze medal he won in Pyeongchang 2018 and silver in Beijing in 2022 at next months Milan-Cortina Olympics.\n\nHe has kept a low profile in recent weeks as rivals shared World Cup wins.\n\n\"I've been working on some things and this year is a tough year. It's an amazing competition,\" said James.\n\n\"We had two Aussies and a Kiwi on the podium which is unbelievable. The Japanese are riding amazing so you've got to put your best foot forward this year to get a sniff of the podium \u2026 I'm pumped.\n\nOn a day when the country's winter sports stars continued to look good with the Milan-Cortina Olympics just round the corner, snowboard cross riders Josie Baff and Adam Lambert also both won medals in China to shoot to the top of the World Cup standings.\n\nIn Germany, 33-year-old Walker took silver behind Kaillie Humphries in the final World Cup monobob race of the season in Altenberg to wrap up second place for the season.\n\nIt was just not quite enough to secure her the overall World Cup triumph, as German Laura Nolte took the seasonal crown by just 17 points.\n\nIn the last race before the Olympic showdown in Cortina next month, Walker had to overturn a 27-point deficit on double world monobob champ Nolte to take the Crystal Globe.\n\nShe defeated the German, who finished third, 0.06 seconds behind the Aussie after their two runs, but fell just short of leapfrogging Nolte in the final standings.\n\nBree Walker (left) came close but couldn't quite run down Laura Nolte (middle) in the last event. (Getty Images: Robert Michael)\n\nHumphries, America's reigning Olympic champ, won in a combined 1minute 58.97 seconds for the two runs, 0.13 seconds ahead of Walker (1:59.10) and 0.19 quicker than Nolte.\n\nThe great news for Walker, though, is that she is in fine shape to attack for historic gold at the Winter Games after the best World Cup season ever by an Australian sledder, in which she won three races in Lillehammer, Sigulda and St Moritz.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Chinese winter resort of Dongbeiya, Baff took silver in the women's final and Lambert bronze in the men's event.\n\nThe pals from Jindabyne in the NSW Snowy Mountains have now moved into top place in their World Cup standings, earning them the coveted yellow leader's bibs.\n\n\"It absolutely does feel like an honour,\" said Lambert. \"Obviously, just two races into the season anything can happen, but for now I will savour the feeling and to do it at the same time as Josie, who was my neighbour for most of my childhood, is a special privilege.\"\n\nBehind Britain's Charlotte Bankes in the big final, Baff grabbed silver in a blanket finish between the other three riders to take the 16th World Cup podium place of her career.\n\nIn the men's final, 28-year-old Lambert was able to earn an eighth World Cup podium as he finished behind Austrian Jakob Dusek and Canada's Eliot Grondin.\n\nAAP",

        "text": "Sony\u2019s once-celebrated stable of owned studios has stalled somewhat recently, as the company flailed while attempting to pivot to live service online games following Fortnite\u2019s success. Its latest hardware releases, including PS5 Pro, PS Portal and PS VR2, seemed to come and go without major support or marketing. But the PS5 is so entrenched and competition from Xbox so non-existent that these events haven\u2019t been the disaster they might have been in a console war era. A remake of Halo, the game that made Microsoft\u2019s original console a hit, is coming in 2026 to Xbox, PC and PlayStation. After 25 years in the console business, Xbox enters 2026 in an unprecedented state. Its collection of owned studios are the strongest it\u2019s ever been, with an incredible slate of recent and upcoming releases. But that has largely come as a result of an outrageous level of investment from Microsoft. As a result, the tech giant is now no longer content with the Xbox being a console contender; it wants a return on its billions, and it knows that there\u2019s more money in being the world\u2019s biggest game publisher than in owning one platform. All of Microsoft\u2019s games go to PC on day one, almost all of them go to PS5 and/or Switch, and they\u2019re all available on the Game Pass subscription for Xbox, PC or streaming from the cloud. The result is that PC or PlayStation gamers can now enjoy Xbox games without needing to buy an Xbox. The big Halo, Gears, Forza and Fable releases due this year will be available on all platforms, even smart TVs. That\u2019s a net positive for many people, but it does also mean the erasure of a characteristic Xbox culture, and some commentators have warned that an overbearing Microsoft could be destructive for the brand or even the industry. The company is expected to reveal new consoles this year which are essentially Windows PCs, paving the way for Sony games to appear on Xbox as well.\n\nAs for Nintendo, it continues to chart an entirely separate path. Its expansion has not involved putting its properties and games onto other platforms, but turning them into broader entertainment franchises. The power of the Switch 2 means more blockbuster games, including Resident Evil Requiem, will come to Nintendo\u2019s system in 2026. This year we\u2019re due a second Super Mario animated movie, and will likely get the first glimpse of 2027\u2019s The Legend of Zelda live action film, as the company also continues to expand into toys, lifestyle tech and real-world experiences. On the game side, there\u2019s a significant crossover in libraries between the Switch and PS5, but the devices are so distinct that they hardly compete. Last year\u2019s launch of the Switch 2 was successful, but this year Nintendo will need to furnish plenty of its own games to keep interest up. With the increase in power allowing for more blockbuster games on the platform, Nintendo could offer an alternative to the PS5 or PC for players who want their games on the go and don\u2019t mind a visual downgrade. As the oldest continuous console platform-holder, Nintendo also continues to mine its history for its retro game subscription, which this year will include the failed 1995 VR accessory Virtual Boy.\n\nJames Bond will return in 007: First Light, scheduled for May. The 15 biggest games coming in 2026 Though it would be a miracle for none of them to be delayed to a later year, here are the 15 games from the biggest publishers and franchises currently slated for 2016. 007: First Light \u2013 A cinematic James Bond origin story from IO Interactive, the creators of the Hitman series, featuring sneaking, shooting and driving.\n\nControl Resonant \u2013 Sequel to 2019\u2019s surreal psychological masterpiece Control, from Alan Wake\u2019s Remedy Entertainment.\n\nThe Duskbloods \u2013 A multiplayer action game from Elden Ring developer FromSoftware, exclusively for Switch 2.\n\nFable \u2013 A long-gestating and serially delayed reboot for Xbox\u2019s iconic fantasy RPG, from Playground Games, which promises sardonic British humour and player choice.\n\nFire Emblem: Fortunes Weave \u2013 Nintendo\u2019s anime-inspired and relationship-centred battle tactics series enters the 4K era with a gladiatorial vibe.\n\nForza Horizon 6 \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s celebrated open-world racing series, also from Playground, heads to the Japanese countryside.\n\nGears of War: E-Day \u2013 A prequel for the original cover-based shooter, from Microsoft\u2019s The Coalition, marks the return of much-loved duo Dom and Marcus. After several delays, GTA 6 is now slated for November 19.\n\nGrand Theft Auto VI \u2013 Rockstar\u2019s follow-up to the highest-grossing entertainment product ever is set in a fictionalised Florida.\n\nMarvel\u2019s Wolverine \u2013 From Insomniac, creators of the recent Spider-man games, this adventure promises to be much more brutal and gory.\n\nMarathon \u2013 The first game from Bungie (Halo, Destiny) under Sony ownership, this online extraction shooter is a reimagining of the developer\u2019s 90s sci-fi franchise.\n\nResident Evil Requiem \u2013 The ninth main entry in Capcom\u2019s zombie franchise series features two heroes and blends the horror of RE2 with the action of RE4.\n\nSaros \u2013 Sony\u2019s arcade shooter experts Housemarque follow up 2021\u2019s Returnal with another offbeat rinse-and-repeat game, heavy on story to unpack and colour-coded bullets to dodge.\n\nStar Wars Galactic Racer \u2013 A surprise revival of the N64 racing franchise, from a team made up of former Need for Speed and Burnout developers.\n\nTomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis \u2013 his reimagining of the 1996 original is also the first game from Crystal Dynamics as part of a commercial deal with Amazon.\n\nYoshi and the Mysterious Book \u2013 Nintendo platformer with an illustrated visual style, where Yoshi has to suss out various creatures and lifeforms. Valve is expanding its PC-based hardware in 2026 following the success of the Steam Deck (bottom left). This year it will launch a VR headset, a controller and a console. Rise and rise of the popular platforms While console gaming is still big business, it hasn\u2019t really grown in terms of player numbers or revenue during this hardware generation. Instead, much of the expansion has come from gaming on PC and mobile; casual players already have those devices for productivity purposes so can play without an additional console, while new phone and PC hardware is making high-end play more accessible too. Valve, the company behind PC game marketplace Steam, has had great success with its Steam Deck handheld which matches the flexibility of PC with the streamlining of a console. In 2026, it will release the Steam Machine, a similar but more powerful device designed to be used in the loungeroom or at a desk. It\u2019s not impossible that it will go head-to-head with the new Xbox in terms of price and capability.\n\nOn the mobile side, Apple continues to push processing power to the point that new blockbuster games can run on iPhones, while popular online and live service games work on any device. Accessory makers including Backbone and Razer make controllers designed to turn any phone into a game console when players are on the go. Loading There\u2019s also potential for the popular platforms to power a switch from local processing to streaming, which would allow any internet-connected device to play any game. Xbox is the current leader in this area after Google abandoned its Stadia platform in 2023, but Sony operates its own streaming system in certain regions (not Australia). Late last year, Netflix activated a streaming game element on its service, allowing subscribers to play party games using their TV and smartphones. Nvidia, the richest company in the world, also runs GeForce now, a service that lets players stream games using the company\u2019s latest graphics hardware.",

        "text": "Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile it may seem now that Trump is throwing his weight around the world relatively unimpeded, Bremmer reminds us of another acronym ascribed to Trump: TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out). \u201cTrump tries FAFO everywhere, he just fails a lot. It wasn\u2019t like he wasn\u2019t trying FAFO with the Russians in the beginning, he just failed because Putin says no.\u201d Those countries seen as weak tend to get the FAFO treatment, while strong ones eventually get TACO. Mexico and Venezuela are in the FAFO basket. So is Ukraine, which Trump likes to describe as \u201cbrave\u201d, while Denmark might be about to find out where it stands. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in October. Credit: Getty Images Where this approach has come unstuck is China, which, through its sheer economic size and stranglehold over the world\u2019s supply of critical minerals, has forced Trump to backtrack on tariffs and into an uneasy truce. That has also involved Trump playing down concerns about the future of Taiwan and reportedly urging Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to tone down her rhetoric on the subject. \u201cMost countries that find themselves really vulnerable [to the US], they\u2019re trying to defend first \u2013 not get into a fight, say all the right things to Trump \u2013 and hedge second,\u201d said Bremmer. \u201cChina hasn\u2019t navigated anything. China basically said, \u2018We\u2019re not even returning your phone call until you back off\u2019, and Trump was surprised, but ultimately, he backed off.\u201d Still, one of the administration\u2019s top priorities is to weaken Beijing\u2019s dominance in that regard. Scott Bessent, Trump\u2019s Treasury secretary, says the goal is not for the US and its allies to decouple from China but to de-risk their economies from reliance on China\u2019s rare earths. Australia, which signed a critical minerals co-operation agreement with the US in October, is potentially a major partner in that effort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This doesn\u2019t strike me as a sea change\u2019 Some critics within the MAGA movement \u2013 most notably former congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who had a spectacular falling out with the president \u2013 see Trump\u2019s first 12 months of foreign policy intervention as antithetical to the \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. Since December, the president and his team have made a deliberate effort to get him talking about the economy and the cost of living, including at several rallies around the US. Bremmer says that while it may seem right now that Trump is becoming more intent on military intervention around the world, his approach is not markedly different from his first term. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t strike me as a sea change. It\u2019s not a sudden break in Trump policy, either from last year or from his first administration. He\u2019s used military force in his first administration. It was never about regime change. It was never about extended American confrontations that the US would have to pay for both financially, as well as in blood. That continues to be true,\u201d Bremmer said at the Foreign Policy event. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is escorted to the courthouse in Manhattan after his capture at the start of this month. Credit: Bloomberg In Venezuela, for example, Trump removed Maduro \u2013 regarded by the US and many nations as an illegitimate dictator \u2013 but is now working with Maduro\u2019s deputy, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, and has shown little interest in regime change or democratic elections. Trump\u2019s main interest in Venezuela is to secure its oil \u2013 the largest proven reserves in the world \u2013 for the US. Bremmer notes Trump\u2019s main objective is financial. He wants to compel countries and companies to invest money in the US, he wants greater control of \u2013 and even government equity stakes in \u2013 key companies and industries, and he wants to make more money for himself, his family and his friends. \u201cAll of those things are ramped up significantly from [his] first term. But again, the seeds were there, and they\u2019ve now grown.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Loading The stubbornly high cost of credit card debt has long attracted attention from politicians \u2013 Australian banks faced a Senate inquiry on the topic in 2015 and the corporate cop has also scrutinised the industry. In response, banks maintain high rates simply reflect the cost of providing the product. For one, credit card debt is unsecured, unlike a home loan. This is riskier for a bank because it means that if you don\u2019t pay back the loan, there\u2019s no asset the bank can sell. Rates are also particularly high on the cards that come with perks \u2013 such as the ability to earn frequent flyer points \u2013 as opposed to dedicated \u201clow rate\u201d cards, which in Australia at least, are in some cases under 10 per cent.\n\nIt\u2019s also likely rates are so high because banks know full well that many of their customers never pay any interest \u2013 they simply pay back the full bill every month, taking advantage of the interest-free days. So, those who do pay interest subsidise the many who don\u2019t. Would capping interest rates save consumers money? In the short-term, no doubt it would. One US study has claimed US customers could save about $100 billion a year under a 10 per cent rate cap. But the US banks are arguing what bankers nearly always say when their business model is threatened: that they will lend less money as a result. They would say that of course, but there is some truth to it: squeezing the revenue banks make from cards would surely have an impact. Credit card interest rates are stubbornly high, including in Australia. Credit: Jessica Shapiro\n\nIn the US, where cards are widely used to finance spending, big cuts in credit card lending could have significant economic consequences \u2013 partly because about 80 per cent of American adults have a credit card. There\u2019s also a risk that a cap simply drives people to other forms of unregulated credit, which can cause other problems for consumers. But if capping rates might not be practical, what would be a better way to deal with the problems caused by credit cards? On this front, Australia provides a useful example of policies that have helped to encourage people to use credit card debt more sensibly, and pay less interest as a result. Indeed, over the past decade and a half, the total value of credit card balances that are accruing interest has plunged from about $35 billion to $19.7 billion, Canstar says, while the number of credit card accounts has also fallen. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has said that by late 2022, the total credit card interest paid by consumers had dropped by more than 40 per cent in the previous five years. Card debt remained a problem for many, especially younger people, ASIC said, but consumers have generally cut their balances that are accruing interest.\n\nLoading The main reasons for this are probably tighter regulation; the support households received in COVID-19 (some of which helped pay down debt); competition from buy now, pay later (BNPL) disruptors; and households being more savvy in how they use their cards. A series of credit card reforms also commenced late last decade, including a ban on unsolicited credit increase offers, the right to request a credit limit reduction and card cancellation online, and tougher responsible lending assessments. Banks have also helped to encourage people to use their cards more sensibly, such as some lenders sending SMS reminders to encourage people to pay off more than the minimum amount. Payments expert Lance Blockley says there are some big differences between Australia\u2019s credit card market and that of the US.\n\nHe points out that regulation of lending money in Australia is tighter to due to responsible lending laws, and in the US the card issuers are more generous with the perks they offer customers to encourage them to spend on cards (such as frequent flyer points to reward spending.) The reason it\u2019s easier to get frequent flyer points in the US is once again its lighter approach to regulation \u2013 over the years the Reserve Bank of Australia has cracked down on the fees that fund many of the frequent flyer points in Australia. What\u2019s more, in the US, it\u2019s common for lenders to use \u201crisk based pricing,\u201d which means less creditworthy people are charged higher interest rates because they are riskier to banks and card issuers. All of these factors make credit card interest rates a sensitive topic in the US \u2013 but Blockley says Trump\u2019s \u201crate cap\u201d is unlikely to come into force, and if it does, it won\u2019t necessarily solve the problem. \u201cIf it did get up, it would likely cut a source of credit to people who need it,\u201c Blockley says. \u201cIf you suddenly starve a segment of the American public of credit, you\u2019re likely to see either a drop in retail sales and/or them searching for credit elsewhere.\u201d Australia\u2019s experience suggests tighter regulation of credit cards \u2013 without the need for a rate cap \u2013 has helped to nudge people towards more sensible forms of borrowing on plastic.",

He leavened the soaring lines of Nessun Dorma with phrases of quieter nuance to give classic shape to this most famous of moments and, more broadly, created a rounded character, which avoided pushing Calaf\u2019s forceful dominance too far into wearying and overbearing self-centredness. Nash was every bit his equal as Turandot, matching his tone in the riddle scene with vivid dramatic colours and riveting, almost frightening, intensity, which she transformed to a softer glow in the final scene. Leva captured both simplicity and depth as Liu singing with light charm in Act 1 and allowing more full-blooded passion into the sound in Act 3. Her most memorable note was the high B flat in her first aria, which emerged like a quiet truth in a mist of melancholy. Richard Anderson was a poignant Timur giving well-shaped lines unvarnished eloquence. As the three Ps, Gabbedy, Longmuir and Petruccelli provided sarcastic comic counterpoint, sustaining Puccini\u2019s slightly overlong scene in Act II strongly, with well-articulated vocal lines and witty deflection, as though responsible for the running of the machinery of a surveillance state. In fading respectable skivvy and slacks Gregory Brown sang the Emperor\u2019s role with frail clarity like one keen to return to his retirement village, while Shane Lowrencev made the Speaker\u2019s role into a mindless vehicle of autocratic edicts. Placed on a revolving stage with static symbolic movements, the Opera Australia Chorus sang with vivid openness, subtlety and power to bind together these fragments of the excesses of human passion.\n\nDANCE\n\nEXXY\n\nSydney Opera House, Drama Theatre\n\nJanuary 15\n\nUntil January 18\n\nReviewed by KATIE LAWRENCE\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Think of something in the world that makes you question the future of humanity. I\u2019ll wait.\n\n(Actually, I won\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019d be here all night.) Whatever came to mind, Dan Daw\u2019s Exxy is the antidote. Exxy is a dance-theatre love letter to the best of us: to survival, to tenderness, and to a tiny boy with cerebral palsy and his ballsy Nan, belting out The Power of Love into the red dust of the outback. It is hilarious, ferocious, devastating \u2013 and somehow also an incredible night out.\n\nDan Daw is resplendent in a tank top and kilt. Credit: Neil Bennett The action unfolds against corrugated iron, framed by deck chairs and the vast Australian landscape. The cast of four (Daw, Tiiu Mortley, Joseph Brown and Sofia Valdiri) are stunning. Monologues and movement land like gut-punches, then pull you in for a hug. From the jump, Exxy commits hard to inclusion. Participation isn\u2019t just welcome; it\u2019s actively directed via flashing overhead captions. Don\u2019t panic. I have never enjoyed being gently bossed around by a show more, including the singalong (no spoilers, but it goes off). The costumes and sets (by Kat Heath) are Mad Max survival chic: industrial greys, bodies braced for impact. It\u2019s battle gear with a forehead kiss. Daw is resplendent in a tank top and kilt, tattoos on full display. His solos are breathtaking in their intelligence and clarity; the definition of a dancer working with his body. Guy Connelly\u2019s soundtrack ranges from lilting melodies to techno thuds, matching the movement. The stage is carpeted in saltbush and light. Daw\u2019s metaphor is clear: saltbush doesn\u2019t just survive; it bursts through concrete.\n\nExxy is packed with camp, gleeful absurdity. Credit: Neil Bennett Exxy doesn\u2019t sugarcoat. It tells stories of sexual rejection and casual cruelty: doors slammed in faces; turning up for a hookup only to be asked to leave after undressing; encounters with people who need someone else kneeling in order to feel tall. Don\u2019t be misled into thinking Exxy is solemn. It is packed with camp, gleeful absurdity \u2013 performers on all fours, drooling onto the stage; a \u201cwho\u2019s better at cerebral palsy\u201d battle that ends in applause; a group marathon where the destination is unclear but the vibe is unadulterated \u201cI got you.\u201d Exxy is 90 minutes in a room full of people who vocally have your back. Like saltbush, Exxy doesn\u2019t ask for permission to take up space. It insists on participation, demands tenderness \u2013 and turns the theatre into an intimate, raucous, glorious celebration of being alive.\n\nDANCE\n\nSave the Last Dance for Me\n\nPalm Grove, Sydney Town Hall, & Leichhardt Town Hall\n\nJanuary 15\n\nUntil January 23\n\nReviewed by CHANTAL NGUYEN\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd In Save the Last Dance for Me, a white dance floor is marked out with masking tape in a diamond pattern. A slow, electro-swing beat begins (Aurora Bauz\u00e0 and Pere Jou\u2019s soundscape), and two men pace onto the dance floor (Gianmaria Borzillo and Giovanfrancesco Giannini). They both have neat, toned physiques; upright posture; slick fashionable clothes; and impassive facial expressions. Stylistically, they are clearly European contemporary dance artists. Gianmaria Borzillo and Giovanfrancesco Giannini. Credit: Stephen Wilson Barker But the dance itself has more earthy roots. It is the polka chinata, a folk dance from Bologna, Italy when early-1900s social norms prohibited men from dancing with unmarried women. So the men danced with each other, exerting to attract female attention with the polka chinata\u2019s rapid complexity.\n\nBorzillo and Giannini slowly grasp each other in a ballroom embrace, their bodies gently lifting like two lungs inhaling. A pause like a wave cresting, then they begin gliding down each arm of the diamond, their feet moving in a swift, syncopated pattering step. The travelling step becomes hypnotic in its speed and liquid intricacy. One false move and the dance would meet the kind of tangled end you see in cycling race pile-ups. Loading But Borzillo and Giannini never misstep, their bodies moving with such smooth, disciplined synchrony that it is like watching one entity rather than two (interestingly, the two male bodies are far more visually uniform than ballroom dancing\u2019s usual male-female pairing). There are dizzying spins and a remarkable scooching turn, where Borzillo and Giannini grasp each other\u2019s biceps, crouch down, and begin to whirl. When the choreographer, Venice Golden Lion-winner Alessandro Sciarroni, first learnt about the polka chinata, you could count on one hand the number of couples who still knew how to dance it. He sent Borzillo and Giannini to Bologna to learn the dying artform. That effort led to this extraordinary piece, a rediscovery of a folk dance form, beatified and resurrected in a modern, fine arts setting.",

If they are keen to make it succeed, they will make it succeed, and if they are not interested in making it succeed, it will fail. It is in the hands of the Israelis in terms of the border crossing, the aid, and the reconstruction, it is all in the hands of the occupation, the Israeli occupation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Council President Antonio Costa says the European Union is coordinating a response to new US tariffs targeting several European countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced 10 per cent tariffs from 1 February, rising to 25 per cent in June, until a deal is reached for what he has called the complete and total purchase of Greenland.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trump argues Greenland is critical for global security and the effectiveness of the U-S Golden Dome defence system.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tariffs target Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U-K, the Netherlands, and Finland, which President Costa says the EU will vigorously defend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The European Union will always be very firm in the defense of international law, wherever it may be, and of course starting in the territory of the member states of the European Union.

        "text": "As the new year settles in, it's not unusual to take stock of your life \u2014 including whether it's finally time to make a change at work.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea of switching careers can be exciting and daunting, often at the same time. It usually comes with a familiar set of questions: How do you make it work financially, how do you know what career to move into, and do you actually hate your job \u2014 or just your boss?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you're thinking about changing careers, experts say it's worth slowing down before making any big decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nJane Jackson, a career coach and author of Navigating Career Crossroads, says interest in meaningful, values-led work surged after the pandemic, but the current economic climate has made many people more cautious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"2025 was the tightest job market I've experienced in all my years of coaching,\" Jackson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was a little bit of fear about making a change in case they couldn't land the roles that they desired.\"\n\n\n\nBecause of a thinner job market and higher levels of redundancy, Jackson says career changes in 2026 need to be more strategic and targeted.\n\n\n\n\n\nData released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics this week show in November 2025, Australia's total job vacancies were 326,700.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis represented a decrease of 0.2 per cent from August 2025, while over the 12 months to November 2025, there were 17,800 fewer job vacancies \u2014 a fall of 5.2 per cent.\n\n\n\nThink sideways first, not from scratch\n\nBefore making any big decisions, Jackson says it's important to slow down and identify what's actually driving your dissatisfaction at work.\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it your manager? The company culture? The pay? Or something else entirely?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What is it that you don't like about your job? You really have to assess that,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It might not be the job at all \u2014 it might be the manager, the culture, or the way you're treated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People lump it all into one, which is a mistake.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Michelle left her career and marriage and started saying 'yes'. It changed her life\n\nIn some cases, those problems can be solved without leaving your role. In others, a change in employer, industry or position may be enough \u2014 without needing to retrain or start again from scratch.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore leaping into a dramatic career pivot, Jackson encourages smaller, \"lilypad\" moves, such as moving laterally into adjacent industries or similar roles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In order to get from A to Z, you're going to be making some detours,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Careers are not linear \u2014 it's very much like a matrix.\"\n\n\n\nExplore, talk to people, experiment\n\nJackson similarly encourages career changers to identify skills where they have both high competence and high enjoyment, and to leverage those transferable skills to move into tangentially related roles or industries.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of that process might involve investigative work, such as looking up people on LinkedIn who already have the career you want and examining how they got there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Very few careers are linear,\" Jackson says. \"There are so many other roles that people don't even know exist.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you start to see people's career journeys, you realise they've leveraged transferable skills to get their foot in the door.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Have a look at how other people got there \u2014 you'll see common threads.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO How a literacy and numeracy program is helping adults open up career options SBS News 05:01 English\n\nKate Richardson, a career coach, says exploration doesn't have to involve quitting your job or making a major financial commitment straight away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Exploring really comes down to two things: expanding your connections and finding ways to experiment,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat might include short courses, side projects, volunteering, contract work or informal conversations with people already working in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Anything that gives you more hands-on or tangible experience of a pathway without necessarily making a big commitment.\"\n\n\n\nIdentify your values\n\nValues alignment plays a major role in long-term career satisfaction, Jackson says, and she encourages anyone considering a change to get clear on what they need from work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You've got to make values-based decisions, because otherwise it doesn't feel right,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way to do that is by identifying your top five values and ranking them in order of importance. This can help clarify whether the issue is your role, your workplace, or whether a larger shift is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If your values are being compromised, then you'll know whether staying is acceptable or not,\" Jackson says.\n\n\n\nBut keep the market in mind\n\nRichardson says it's also important to balance values-driven work with an understanding of current market realities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's got to encompass all of that \u2014 values, strengths, lifestyle and what's happening in the market,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You do have to cast an eye across the market and understand the changes that are going on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are trends that impact employability or opportunity, and it's important to know that.\"\n\n\n\nJob ads for nursing and construction roles saw the most growth year-on-year, according to December data from SEEK. Source: SBS News LinkedIn's Jobs on the Rise 2026 report identified the 15 fastest-growing jobs in Australia, with many roles incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) standing out. AI engineer ranked first, followed by chief risk officer, mechanical engineer, director of artificial intelligence and organisational development manager.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a December report from job site Seek identified strong year-on-year growth in job ads for nursing roles \u2014 particularly theatre, recovery and high-acuity nursing \u2014 alongside ongoing demand for general practitioners, aged and disability support workers, and management roles in construction.\n\n\n\nAcknowledge fear, but don't let it make the decision\n\nTaking the leap into a career change is difficult at the best of times, and financial logistics can make it even harder.\n\n\n\n\n\nRichardson says concerns about money, study and risk are often what stop people from moving forward \u2014 but those fears don't always reflect reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No matter your age, your brain will always kick in with all the reasons why it's not going to work,\" she says. \"That's just your brain kicking into risk management mode.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the exploration process can help people separate genuine practical constraints from assumptions that haven't yet been tested \u2014 whether that's researching salary progression, understanding long-term opportunities, or mapping out what a short-term step back might realistically look like.\n\n\n\nRichardson says many people delay career change not because they lack options, but because they feel pressure to have a clear answer before they begin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As long as it feels fuzzy and you're lacking confidence, it's very easy to stick with the status quo,\" Richardson says.\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than trying to land on a perfect end goal, she encourages people to focus on identifying possibilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the best ways to get started is to forget the answer just for a minute and instead think about a few possibilities,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you let go of the answer and you identify possibilities, you can take small steps to actively explore those possibilities further.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Donald Trump is in physical possession of a Nobel Peace Prize medal, gifted to him by last year's winner, Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut according to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, no matter what happens to the 18-carat gold medal, the prize itself \"remains inseparably linked to the person or organisation designated as the laureate\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organisation issued a statement making its position clear on Saturday, after Machado gave her award to the United States president during a meeting at the White House this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe committee noted that laureates receive a gold medal, a diploma and prize money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is and remains the original laureate who is recorded in history as the recipient of the prize,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\n\"Even if the medal or diploma later comes into someone else\u2019s possession, this does not alter who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prize cannot be shared with others, transferred, or revoked, the committee said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The decision is final and applies for all time.\"\n\n\n\nHas this happened before?\n\nThere are no restrictions on what a Nobel laureate can do with the medal, diploma or prize money. They are free to keep them, give them away, sell or donate them if they wish.\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of Nobel laureates have opted to sell or give away their medals.\n\n\n\n\n\nNane Annan, widow of 2001 peace prize laureate Kofi Annan, donated the medal and diploma to the United Nations Office in Geneva, where they are permanently on display.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Could Donald Trump win the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nIn 2022, Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov sold his peace prize medal for US$103.5 million ($154.8 million) and donated the entire sum to a UNICEF fund for Ukrainian refugee children.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorwegian author Knut Hamsun, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920, gifted his medal to Germany's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, a prominent Nazi, as a gesture of thanks after they met in 1943.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat medal's current whereabouts are unknown, the Nobel Committee noted.\n\n\n\nOthers have also sold their medals, loaned or donated them to museums.\n\n\n\nWhy did Machado give her medal to Trump?\n\nTrump has made no secret of his desire to win the prize. Foreign leaders seeking to curry favour with him have previously put him up for it and hailed his peacemaking efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\nA White House spokesperson complained in October that Trump was snubbed for the 2025 award because the Nobel Committee prioritised \"politics over peace\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, the Trump administration was prominently spearheading an effort to broker peace in Gaza.\n\n\n\nMachado dedicated her award to Trump after it was announced , saying Venezuela was counting on Trump and other key allies to achieve freedom and democracy. She thanked him for his \"decisive support of our cause\".\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the US carried out a lightning strike in Caracas , kidnapping Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to face drug trafficking charges in New York in a move widely seen as illegal by international law experts.\n\n\n\n\n\nMachado presented her prize to Trump at the White House during their first face-to-face meeting on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\"Mar\u00eda presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you Mar\u00eda!\" Trump wrote on social media after the meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was widely interpreted as an effort to gain influence as the future of Machado's country \u2014 currently led on an interim basis by Maduro's former deputy Delcy Rodriguez \u2014 hangs in the balance .\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has previously dismissed suggestions that Machado could be installed as Venezuela's leader, saying she does not have enough support among its people.\n\n\n\n",

I'm too far in \u2014 I even bought acreage just for pigeons.\"\n\n\n\nThe 'dying' world of pigeon racing\n\nHoping to reinvigorate a sport he says is quietly disappearing, Gazzola launched the Meadow One Loft Race four years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach year, hundreds of pigeons are entered from across Australia \u2014 owners pay $350 per bird \u2014 and Gazzola takes them in, vaccinates, feeds, trains, and eventually releases them up to 400km away to race home.\n\n\n\nStevan Gazzola has been racing pigeons for most of his life. But he's worried the sport is dying. Source: SBS News \"People from all over Australia send me their baby pigeons,\" he says. \"We pick them up from the airport, then we vaccinate them, look after them, train them, let them go.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining builds gradually: short flights around the block first, then 10km, then 50km, then 100 km, and so on. He's seen top birds fly 1,000km in eight hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final race offers $75,000 to the winner, with around $250,000 paid out overall. But overseas, it's a different story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're racing for a million dollars,\" he says. \"I can send pigeons to Thailand \u2014 it's a $1,000 per pigeon to enter \u2014 and they're racing for $2.5 million in prize money.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, he says it isn't a money-making sport, with the small coin he might win at local races going straight back to the pigeons. \"You don't do this to get rich,\" he says.\n\n\n\nA sport running out of time\n\nBut Melbourne's pigeon racing scene is dying.\n\n\n\n\n\nMembership at Gazzola's local club has dropped from around 300 to about 90.\n\n\n\n\n\nRacers are ageing. Many are on pensions. Keeping birds requires space, money, time, and physical labour \u2014 all of which are increasingly scarce.\n\n\n\nStevan Gazzola says there's a science to breeding pigeons \u2014 especially if you want them to be racers. Source: SBS News \"They're just dying off. There's no young people joining,\" he says. \"You put in all the hard work and try to keep it going, but as the guys are getting older. They either die or they give up because they can't do it anymore.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome owners send their pigeons to Gazzola, who becomes a kind of foster carer \u2014 feeding, housing and training birds on behalf of people who can't.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, he has noticed a small resurgence in young migrant communities. \"A lot of young Filipinos and Afghans are getting into it here,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Forty years ago, there was nothing to do. You either played footy or cricket \u2014 or raced pigeons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But it is a dying sport. Who wants to sit in their backyard and clean pigeon shit these days?\"\n\n\n\nEnter: The 'crazy pigeon lady'\n\nIn Melbourne's CBD, the scene couldn't be more different.\n\n\n\n\n\nTahlia \u2014 known as 'Frill' to her 300,000+ social media followers \u2014 can often be found outside Victoria's State Library, enveloped by a cloud of pigeons.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 26-year-old \u2014 and her rainbow coloured hair \u2014 started posting videos of herself and pigeons in January and within months, her content went viral.\n\n\n\n26-year-old Frill finds and treats 'stringfoot' pigeons in the hope of changing people's perception of the humble bird. Source: Supplied / Instagram / Frill_underscore \"I'm the crazy pigeon lady,\" she jokes. \"It's great that everyone is tuning in for the pigeons, but if I'm honest, the hair probably had a lot to do with it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her messenger bag are the tools of the trade: bird seed, sanitiser, nail scissors, and a sock she calls \"pigeon jail\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHer mission: find and treat 'stringfoot' pigeons, whose toes have been strangled by string, thread, or human hair \u2014 leading to a painful condition that can cut off circulation and sometimes lead to the loss of toes, or even the entire foot.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo help a pigeon, she gently lures it close with seed before pouncing on it and slipping it into the sock so it can't fly away. Then, she trims the string away from its feet \u2014 a task that can take up to twenty minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is likely a thread from a piece of clothing, that's pretty common,\" she says as she destrings one. \"A lot of the time, human hair and pet hair can get stuck around their feet, too.\"\n\n\n\nShe learnt these skills from Melbourne rescue groups filled with \"pigeon enthusiasts\". While she started with stringfoot cases, she now also takes sick or injured pigeons home to rehabilitate, carrying a small box with her whenever she heads out \"just in case\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Stringfoot is a small symptom of a bigger issue,\" she says. \"Humans cause man-made problems that affect all the animals around them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even [a person's] hair can do this to them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMost days, a small crowd gathers to watch her feed the birds. Children ask to hold seeds. Teenagers hover, half-curious, half-mocking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You'll usually get a flock of people who want to join in,\" she says. \"Others will make fun of me \u2026 I get a lot of people who will do drive-by insults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But a lot of people are genuinely curious \u2026 I have had people who thought I was torturing a pigeon or kidnapping it!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrill's favourite bird is Dovey, a gentle white pigeon who perches on her shoulder and Chicken Boy, who somehow always attracts another bird to sit on him.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's also outspoken about racing: \"I think pigeon racing is outdated.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most pigeon racers lose part of their loft every year. They'll die, or they get lost and join other flocks. It's very common that they collapse from exhaustion \u2026 there's no benefit for the animal.\"\n\n\n\nThe Animal Justice Party's Georgie Purcell says the humble pigeon \u2014 or 'rock dove' \u2014 is a misunderstood, intelligent animal. Source: AAP / Diego Fedele The RSPCA says pigeon racing poses \"many welfare risks\", including susceptibility to predation, high physical demands on their bodies, and some birds veering off course and not returning home.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal Justice Party MP Georgie Purcell also condemns pigeon racing and says our perception of the bird needs to change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am vehemently against this toxic so-called sport,\" Purcell tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Gazzola says while he understands views that racing can be cruel, bird welfare is foundational to his operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our pigeons are bred for endurance and are conditioned gradually with structured training, vet supervision, and careful monitoring,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When the sport is run responsibly with proper health checks, controlled training, safe race routes, and strong oversight, the birds compete in a way that aligns with their natural instincts to fly, navigate, and return home.\"\n\n\n\nAn underrated bird\n\nPurcell is one of many who are on Team Pigeon \u2014 including actress Sarah Paulson, who recently staunchly defended the bird and called for \"pigeon hate\" to be stopped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pigeons are the best example of victims of mankind,\" Purcell says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are an animal that humans used and domesticated for a purpose and then immediately discarded them when they were deemed to be no longer useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, we treat them as if they're a nuisance or something that must be eradicated.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says people often underestimate the humble pigeon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As highly sociable animals, pigeons mate for life, and they are a true representation of equal caring responsibilities, with both female and male pigeons working together to raise their young,\" Purcell said.\n\n\n\nGeorgie Purcell says pigeons are the \"best example of victims of mankind\", formerly domesticated, then left to their own. Source: Getty / Alwin Sun Pigeons can count as well as primates, a 2011 study suggested , with a task showing they have the capacity to count from one to nine. However, they're not quick learners. While monkeys could learn the skill in a couple of months, it took the dear pigeon a year to be trained.\n\n\n\nRats with wings?\n\nDespite their differences, both Gazzola and Frill want people to rethink the humble pigeon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you mention pigeons, people say they're rats with wings,\" Gazzola says. \"They think of what we do here as the average street pigeon that's pecking at chips in the city and is a nuisance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he says his birds are \"probably kept better than how some people live\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're climate-controlled, heated, the food is spotless \u2014 we source the best vitamins from all over the world \u2014 there's no stone left unturned that they don't get,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're athletes of the sky.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrill agrees that pigeons deserve care \u2014 but wants it to extend to all of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of people say they're rats with wings \u2014 I also like rats, so that's not an insult to me \u2014 but it is meant in a derogatory way to say they're dirty and take up space on the street,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe wants to break that stigma: \"They have their own life and they feel and they have very complex social lives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also hopes her content will make people think more deeply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want people to appreciate every animal \u2014 even little street pigeons that people might not care about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want people to think more about the world around them and other animals and how we impact them.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Produced in collaboration with SBS Chinese\n\n\n\n\n\nListen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom crema latte to pistachio matcha and soybean powders, new coffee flavours are bubbling up. In Melbourne, often described as Australia\u2019s coffee capital, Asian-inspired trends are catching on. Cafe manager Jay Lee explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAustralian people like more balanced acidity and less sweetness drinks. Korean or Asian customers want something more sweeter and more creamer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile sales of classic coffees like flat whites and long blacks remain strong, many customers are sampling Asian-inspired blends derived from dessert making and tea brewing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe first thing I think of is infusion \u2014 like teas I think of the mixture of coffee and tea, and flavours I haven\u2019t tried before.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Cru+ caf\u00e9 in Melbourne\u2019s East, Jay Lee says producing exotic creations takes time, technique and precision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAsian-style drinks usually involve more steps: syrup, powders, creams, and clear layer. Keeping everything consistent is harder than making classic Aussie order.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline survey platform, Pureprofile is researching our taste for fancy drinks. Australia\u2019s senior client development director, Kate Richards explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cConsumers want drinks that suit their mood, their energy levels, their diet, and their personal taste. And that flexibility beautifully extends to Asian inspired fusion flavours like matcha and pistachio. It's turning into beverage theatre. More than a caffeine boost, these drinks deliver texture, taste, and shareability. Presentation has become as important as flavour with dessert style lattes doubling as visually arresting performances.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPureprofile\u2019s Social Insights tool found that Asian-inspired food and drink now accounts for 28 per cent of online share. Ms Richards says it\u2019s part of a broader pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTrends like Instagram-worthy lattes are exploding in popularity right now. For example, TikTok views of pistachio matcha lattes more than doubled in eight months. Asian inspiration is everywhere, not only in food and beverages, but in categories like fashion, beauty, travel, and tech.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA changing demographic may be driving the trend \u2013 with more than 17 per cent of people in Australia claiming Asian heritage. Among popular choices - hojicha latte \u2014 a creamy Japanese tea drink made from roasted green tea, or Earl Grey iced latte with salted cream. In the summer heat, many customers are looking for a cooler style, like grapefruit cold brew layered over sparkling water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think this has a bit of grapefruit in it, from what I can see and taste. I think it might have cold brew.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nO ther drinks are inspired by Korean flavours, including the Kinako latte \u2014 a caffeine-free Japanese and Korean drink made from roasted soybean powder. Cru+ manager Jay Lee says broadening the caf\u00e9\u2019s range is good for business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s given the customers something they can\u2019t experience before \u2018inspired by the Japan, Japanese.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the 400 coffees sold each day \u2014server Phillip Sim says demand for Asian styles is rising steadily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe try to create something special, something new. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s getting popular and popular.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, when it comes to a daily cup, not everyone is convinced. Caf\u00e9 owner Sam Wang.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u201cLong black, latte, cappuccino and flat white, these four different type of coffees are still our best-sellers.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "While housing continues to become less affordable in most Australian cities and regions, Melbourne has thrown up some data quirks that experts have linked to state government policies, with houses now cheaper to rent there than they were 12 months ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, the cost of renting a house or unit increased across Australia's combined capitals in the year leading up to December 2025, according to a new Domain report.\n\n\n\n\n\nMelbourne, consistently ranked the most liveable city in the nation , is now the cheapest capital city to rent a house in at an average of $580 per week, as asking prices hit the \"affordability ceiling\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of renting a house in Melbourne fell by 1.7 per cent over the year, the only drop of any property type in any Australian city, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fall in value will have mixed results for renters, landlords and investors in Victoria, while the country grapples with a national shortage of new properties and low vacancy rates.\n\n\n\nWhat's caused values to fall?\n\nThe cost of renting a house in Melbourne fell $10 per week in the 12 months to December 2025, saving tenants $520 per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet units became more expensive in the city, rising from an average of $550 per week in December 2024 to $580 a year later \u2014 on par with house rents.\n\n\n\n\n\nMelbourne unit prices are cheaper on average per week than Sydney ($750), Brisbane and Perth (both $650), Darwin ($598) and on par with Canberra. Only Hobart and Adelaide have cheaper unit prices at $480 and $525 a week respectively.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Domain's chief of research and economics, Nicola Powell, told SBS News that housing supply has been stronger in Melbourne compared to other cities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think supply choice has been much better for tenants,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And what that means from an asking rent perspective is landlords are having to be much more realistic on the price point they place on their home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMelbourne had the highest vacancy rate of any capital in December at 1.6 per cent.\n\n\n\nMore first home buyers, fewer investors\n\nFederal and state government policies have also made a difference.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new national first-home buyers scheme \u2014 which allows all first-home buyers to put down a deposit of 5 per cent \u2014 has reduced demand for rentals as tenants look to purchase their first property, Powell explained.\n\n\n\nState taxation changes affecting Victorians who own, or are looking to buy, investment properties have led to an increase in the fees investment property owners pay.\n\n\n\n\n\nPowell said these changes have led to people offloading investment properties in the last couple of years and choosing to invest in other states.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proportion of investment in Victoria is one of the lowest in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's sitting at just under 34 per cent of loans being financed to investors,\" Powell said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"NSW sits at 46 per cent. So you can see there's a vast difference in participation rates from investors.\"\n\n\n\nProperty Council research shows that investors are currently looking away from Melbourne due to its \"harsh tax settings\", and instead choosing states with less punitive property charges.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Lowcock, Victorian deputy executive director of the Property Council, told SBS News that Melbourne's liveability has traditionally been underpinned by strong private investment in housing, infrastructure and amenity.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said for rents to stay low, investors need to be kept onside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With that pipeline of investment dropping away, it is becoming harder to deliver the homes that current and future Victorians need,\" Lowcock said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If Victoria wants to stay competitive, we need to do more to encourage investment and create the conditions that encourage more homes to be built.\"\n\n\n\nNational data\n\nPowell predicted that the cost of renting in Melbourne would remain stable due to the \"affordability ceiling\" \u2014 the maximum a population can pay \u2014 being reached.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're certainly not seeing any indication that we're going to see rent suddenly start to accelerate,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Domain's December rental report, the most expensive houses per week in Australia are found in Sydney at $800.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was followed by Darwin, Canberra and Perth, where renting a house cost $700 per week on average.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News The cost of renting a unit has increased across the board since December 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney has the highest average weekly unit rent at $750, followed by Brisbane and Perth at $650 respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Overall competition for rentals is still quite strong, but I think affordability is increasingly capping how far and how fast rents can rise,\" Powell said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have to remember that Australia is still operating in a landlord's market, which means vacancy rates are below two per cent across every single capital city.\"\n\n\n\nHow can cities be both liveable and affordable?\n\nWhen grading Australian cities on metrics like health care, education, and infrastructure, Melbourne comes in first place, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2025 Global Liveability Index.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2025, Melbourne was ranked the fourth most liveable city in the world, followed by Sydney in sixth place and Adelaide in ninth.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Michaela lives eight hours from her young daughter \u2014 the rental crisis is now separating families\n\nKate Raynor, an urban planning expert with the University of Melbourne's Life Course Centre, explained why Melbourne ranks so highly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Melbourne does public spaces and public transport connectivity and safety in the public realm really well,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is less air pollution and historically has been quite affordable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe explained that Melbourne has a diversity of housing types and densities, which helps improve affordability as it's easier for people to move up and down the property ladder.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn top of its varied housing stock, Victoria approves more new homes than other Australian states, Raynor said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to 2025 Australian Bureau of Statistics data, Victoria accounted for 5,215 new home approvals in November out of the 18,406 reported nationwide. NSW followed with 4,848, while Queensland approved 4,558.\n\n\n\nDoes Melbourne offer lessons for other cities?\n\nCost of living presents challenges to liveability, Raynor said, which can make balancing a desirable area and cost-effectiveness difficult for governments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You want to be building amenities and infrastructure, but at the same time not drive people out with escalating prices,\" she said.\n\n\n\nShe said all cities, not just Melbourne, need to invest in more social housing and medium-density housing to continue thriving and keep renting affordable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Invest in social housing, because that is where the need is greatest, that's where the housing stress is greatest, and that is the most obvious and direct route from someone who is at risk of homelessness or severe housing stress into housing stability,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith any new housing also comes the need for transport infrastructure, she added, so that people aren't \"locked in\" to outer and developing suburbs.\n\n\n\n",

Today games of all sizes \u2013 from multimillion-dollar productions made by thousands, to experiments created by a single person \u2013 are enjoyed by billions of people around the world. As commercial products, they also generate more revenue than the film, music, and television industries combined. The money has attracted tech giants and huge global corporations into the space, and while there are undeniable growing pains \u2013 ballooning costs, 10-year development cycles, unsafe working environments \u2013 gaming\u2019s popularity continues to increase. In 2026, another side effect of this expansion will be felt most keenly: the erosion of the walls that used to keep individual consoles (PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo) and platforms apart. Several franchises owned by Microsoft or Sony will be playable across all platforms this year. Returning in 2026: Marathon, Halo, GTA, Tomb Raider, Resident Evil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe consoles wars are over, for now The idea of a console war, where players are split by their allegiance to certain platforms, was essentially left behind in the 90s. But the culture has persisted in some sense, since many players don\u2019t have the time, funds or inclination to support multiple platforms, meaning they miss out on games that are exclusive to certain consoles. But in 2026, the battle appears to be over. Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft now offer three totally different propositions, and could hardly be said to compete at all. Marvel\u2019s Wolverine is a major PlayStation 5 exclusive slated for this year. Sony\u2019s PlayStation still largely follows the path that served it well through the PS2, PS3 and PS4 generations. The PS5 is the de facto mainstream home console, hosting games from all major third-party publishers and thousands of indies as well as marquee releases from Sony\u2019s own studios. The company has begun publishing its own games on PC and including them in its PlayStation Plus subscription, albeit not right away, and is even experimenting with publishing on Xbox and Switch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSony\u2019s once-celebrated stable of owned studios has stalled somewhat recently, as the company flailed while attempting to pivot to live service online games following Fortnite\u2019s success. Its latest hardware releases, including PS5 Pro, PS Portal and PS VR2, seemed to come and go without major support or marketing. But the PS5 is so entrenched and competition from Xbox so non-existent that these events haven\u2019t been the disaster they might have been in a console war era. A remake of Halo, the game that made Microsoft\u2019s original console a hit, is coming in 2026 to Xbox, PC and PlayStation. After 25 years in the console business, Xbox enters 2026 in an unprecedented state. Its collection of owned studios are the strongest it\u2019s ever been, with an incredible slate of recent and upcoming releases. But that has largely come as a result of an outrageous level of investment from Microsoft. As a result, the tech giant is now no longer content with the Xbox being a console contender; it wants a return on its billions, and it knows that there\u2019s more money in being the world\u2019s biggest game publisher than in owning one platform. All of Microsoft\u2019s games go to PC on day one, almost all of them go to PS5 and/or Switch, and they\u2019re all available on the Game Pass subscription for Xbox, PC or streaming from the cloud. The result is that PC or PlayStation gamers can now enjoy Xbox games without needing to buy an Xbox. The big Halo, Gears, Forza and Fable releases due this year will be available on all platforms, even smart TVs. That\u2019s a net positive for many people, but it does also mean the erasure of a characteristic Xbox culture, and some commentators have warned that an overbearing Microsoft could be destructive for the brand or even the industry. The company is expected to reveal new consoles this year which are essentially Windows PCs, paving the way for Sony games to appear on Xbox as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for Nintendo, it continues to chart an entirely separate path. Its expansion has not involved putting its properties and games onto other platforms, but turning them into broader entertainment franchises. The power of the Switch 2 means more blockbuster games, including Resident Evil Requiem, will come to Nintendo\u2019s system in 2026. This year we\u2019re due a second Super Mario animated movie, and will likely get the first glimpse of 2027\u2019s The Legend of Zelda live action film, as the company also continues to expand into toys, lifestyle tech and real-world experiences. On the game side, there\u2019s a significant crossover in libraries between the Switch and PS5, but the devices are so distinct that they hardly compete. Last year\u2019s launch of the Switch 2 was successful, but this year Nintendo will need to furnish plenty of its own games to keep interest up. With the increase in power allowing for more blockbuster games on the platform, Nintendo could offer an alternative to the PS5 or PC for players who want their games on the go and don\u2019t mind a visual downgrade. As the oldest continuous console platform-holder, Nintendo also continues to mine its history for its retro game subscription, which this year will include the failed 1995 VR accessory Virtual Boy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Bond will return in 007: First Light, scheduled for May. The 15 biggest games coming in 2026 Though it would be a miracle for none of them to be delayed to a later year, here are the 15 games from the biggest publishers and franchises currently slated for 2016. 007: First Light \u2013 A cinematic James Bond origin story from IO Interactive, the creators of the Hitman series, featuring sneaking, shooting and driving.\n\nControl Resonant \u2013 Sequel to 2019\u2019s surreal psychological masterpiece Control, from Alan Wake\u2019s Remedy Entertainment.\n\nThe Duskbloods \u2013 A multiplayer action game from Elden Ring developer FromSoftware, exclusively for Switch 2.\n\nFable \u2013 A long-gestating and serially delayed reboot for Xbox\u2019s iconic fantasy RPG, from Playground Games, which promises sardonic British humour and player choice.\n\nFire Emblem: Fortunes Weave \u2013 Nintendo\u2019s anime-inspired and relationship-centred battle tactics series enters the 4K era with a gladiatorial vibe.\n\nForza Horizon 6 \u2013 Microsoft\u2019s celebrated open-world racing series, also from Playground, heads to the Japanese countryside.\n\nGears of War: E-Day \u2013 A prequel for the original cover-based shooter, from Microsoft\u2019s The Coalition, marks the return of much-loved duo Dom and Marcus. After several delays, GTA 6 is now slated for November 19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrand Theft Auto VI \u2013 Rockstar\u2019s follow-up to the highest-grossing entertainment product ever is set in a fictionalised Florida.\n\nMarvel\u2019s Wolverine \u2013 From Insomniac, creators of the recent Spider-man games, this adventure promises to be much more brutal and gory.\n\nMarathon \u2013 The first game from Bungie (Halo, Destiny) under Sony ownership, this online extraction shooter is a reimagining of the developer\u2019s 90s sci-fi franchise.\n\nResident Evil Requiem \u2013 The ninth main entry in Capcom\u2019s zombie franchise series features two heroes and blends the horror of RE2 with the action of RE4.\n\nSaros \u2013 Sony\u2019s arcade shooter experts Housemarque follow up 2021\u2019s Returnal with another offbeat rinse-and-repeat game, heavy on story to unpack and colour-coded bullets to dodge.\n\nStar Wars Galactic Racer \u2013 A surprise revival of the N64 racing franchise, from a team made up of former Need for Speed and Burnout developers.\n\nTomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis \u2013 his reimagining of the 1996 original is also the first game from Crystal Dynamics as part of a commercial deal with Amazon.\n\nYoshi and the Mysterious Book \u2013 Nintendo platformer with an illustrated visual style, where Yoshi has to suss out various creatures and lifeforms. Valve is expanding its PC-based hardware in 2026 following the success of the Steam Deck (bottom left). This year it will launch a VR headset, a controller and a console. Rise and rise of the popular platforms While console gaming is still big business, it hasn\u2019t really grown in terms of player numbers or revenue during this hardware generation. Instead, much of the expansion has come from gaming on PC and mobile; casual players already have those devices for productivity purposes so can play without an additional console, while new phone and PC hardware is making high-end play more accessible too. Valve, the company behind PC game marketplace Steam, has had great success with its Steam Deck handheld which matches the flexibility of PC with the streamlining of a console. In 2026, it will release the Steam Machine, a similar but more powerful device designed to be used in the loungeroom or at a desk. It\u2019s not impossible that it will go head-to-head with the new Xbox in terms of price and capability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the mobile side, Apple continues to push processing power to the point that new blockbuster games can run on iPhones, while popular online and live service games work on any device. Accessory makers including Backbone and Razer make controllers designed to turn any phone into a game console when players are on the go. Editor's pick Review\n\nVideo games The best video games of 2025, from Ghost of Yotei to Hades 2 There\u2019s also potential for the popular platforms to power a switch from local processing to streaming, which would allow any internet-connected device to play any game. Xbox is the current leader in this area after Google abandoned its Stadia platform in 2023, but Sony operates its own streaming system in certain regions (not Australia). Late last year, Netflix activated a streaming game element on its service, allowing subscribers to play party games using their TV and smartphones. Nvidia, the richest company in the world, also runs GeForce now, a service that lets players stream games using the company\u2019s latest graphics hardware.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the console wars disappear, the new frontier looks likely to be a fight for content across all entertainment media, with Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Meta and others spending billions to acquire game content for their own streaming apps.

In 2012, rubbish started appearing on the beach as coastal erosion ate into the dunes and exposed an old tip site buried long ago. Damage caused by coastal erosion at Port Fairy. Joe Armao Port Fairy resident Nick Abbott remembers old fridges and appliances, pieces of tin and lengths of wire turning up on the beach. \u201cThe concern was that we were seeing the tip of the iceberg and soon the beach could be littered with unsightly rubbish,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following year, Abbott joined other Port Fairy residents in measuring the impact of erosion on local beaches, using posts, rope and laser levels. In 2018, they began using drones, hoping to better understand the problem. With the power of Southern Ocean waves and strong winds battering the shoreline, Port Fairy, in Victoria\u2019s south-west, remains highly susceptible to coastal erosion, a challenge that is accelerating with climate change. Deakin University\u2019s Blake Allan at Port Fairy, where erosion has hit beach areas hard. Nicole Cleary While Port Fairy is among the areas hardest hit by sea level rise, new research focusing on a stretch of beach in bayside Melbourne is providing a ray of hope. It shows human intervention can help to stabilise beaches in the face of coastal erosion, particularly when those efforts are in concert with the natural marine environment. At another Port Fairy beach known as the night soil site, erosion uncovered waste including old toilet cans, some of which rolled down the dunes. But vegetation matting has since been installed to stabilise and promote vegetation growth.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeakin University national coastal drone program scientific lead Blake Allan said the matting had helped protect the old night soil site. But erosion has continued to eat away at the dunes near the former tip site. A rock wall installed in front of the former tip has protected some of the dune but deflected energy from the waves, resulting in aggressive erosion on either side of the wall. Allan has also been monitoring the effects of coastal erosion at Port Fairy and providing the data to policymakers. \u201cYou can\u2019t rely on memories. And we don\u2019t want decisions to be based on one event, because those knee-jerk reactions are really just Band-Aids,\u201d he said. Coastal erosion expert David Kennedy in Sandringham. Joe Armao Recently published research by University of Melbourne coastal geomorphologist David Kennedy found strategies for managing erosion at Sandringham on Port Phillip Bay had been largely successful in the past 20 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe peer-reviewed research, published in the Frontiers in Earth Science journal, examined the impact of human-made structures at Sandringham going back more than 140 years. Initially, sea walls were built to stop the cliff eroding. Kennedy said there was wild fluctuation in erosion in the following decades at Sandringham until the 1990s, when a program of sand replenishment began and the rate of erosion then slowed. In the 2000s, the installation of structures known as rock groynes, which extend into the water perpendicular to the shore, helped further stabilise the beach. Sandringham beach from the air. Joe Armao \u201cWhat we want to do with the groynes is keep the sand on that beach for longer, because over time it\u2019s moving from south to north. That\u2019s where the sand is all going. It\u2019s all ending up in South Melbourne over decades,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKennedy described the movement of sand as a natural phenomenon, but protecting beaches and human-built structures behind them was part of the response to sea-level rise and climate change. \u201cWe tend not to view landforms as dynamic systems.

Locations like Port Fairy, which are exposed to the raw power of the open ocean, would require a different management strategy to Sandringham, Kennedy said. Loch Sport in East Gippsland, Inverloch on the Bass Coast and Silverleaves in Phillip Island are other locations where coastal erosion is posing a serious challenge to communities and the authorities that manage those natural areas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a human-modified world we\u2019ve created,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to work with what nature\u2019s throwing at us to maintain the bits we love.

Got it Share A A A\n\nSome of the biggest banks in the world are preparing for battle in the US, all thanks to a social media post from Donald Trump calling for a 10 per cent cap on credit card interest rates. In case you missed it, Trump spooked investors in big US banks last week after he vowed he\u2019d no longer let Americans be \u201cripped off\u201d by credit card interest rates of 20 to 30 per cent. But the most interesting thing about this fight is not really Trump\u2019s proposal (which may be hard to enforce), nor the worried response from banks, both of which are predictable enough. More surprising is that this is an idea that crosses the notoriously divided US political spectrum. President Donald Trump said he\u2019d no longer allow Americans to be \u201cripped off\u201d on their credit card, spooking investors in US banks. AP Indeed, Trump\u2019s only the latest politician to venture into this space: progressive US politicians including Democrat Elizabeth Warren and independent Bernie Sanders have also backed capping on credit card interest rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact Trump and some of his political foes support such blunt intervention is partly a sign of rising populism, but it also reflects the fact credit card interest rates are very high \u2013 often close to 20 per cent. That\u2019s not only the case in the US, it\u2019s equally true in Australia, where Canstar says the average rate on a balance accruing interest is 18.5 per cent. There are also specific features of credit cards that can get people into debt traps \u2013 such as the ability to only pay off a tiny amount each month, and to rack up large amounts of interest at a very high rate. In short, plenty of people struggle with credit card debt, and it certainly doesn\u2019t help that the interest rates are sky-high. So, why are credit card interest rates so high? And given credit cards can get people into difficulty, why not just cap the interest rates, as Trump and some of his opponents want?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Opinion\n\nRBA Michele Bullock is standing her ground against Trump. Here\u2019s why it matters Millie Muroi Economics Writer The stubbornly high cost of credit card debt has long attracted attention from politicians \u2013 Australian banks faced a Senate inquiry on the topic in 2015 and the corporate cop has also scrutinised the industry. In response, banks maintain high rates simply reflect the cost of providing the product. For one, credit card debt is unsecured, unlike a home loan. This is riskier for a bank because it means that if you don\u2019t pay back the loan, there\u2019s no asset the bank can sell. Rates are also particularly high on the cards that come with perks \u2013 such as the ability to earn frequent flyer points \u2013 as opposed to dedicated \u201clow rate\u201d cards, which in Australia at least, are in some cases under 10 per cent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also likely rates are so high because banks know full well that many of their customers never pay any interest \u2013 they simply pay back the full bill every month, taking advantage of the interest-free days. So, those who do pay interest subsidise the many who don\u2019t. Would capping interest rates save consumers money? In the short-term, no doubt it would. One US study has claimed US customers could save about $100 billion a year under a 10 per cent rate cap. But the US banks are arguing what bankers nearly always say when their business model is threatened: that they will lend less money as a result. They would say that of course, but there is some truth to it: squeezing the revenue banks make from cards would surely have an impact. Credit card interest rates are stubbornly high, including in Australia. Jessica Shapiro\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the US, where cards are widely used to finance spending, big cuts in credit card lending could have significant economic consequences \u2013 partly because about 80 per cent of American adults have a credit card. There\u2019s also a risk that a cap simply drives people to other forms of unregulated credit, which can cause other problems for consumers. But if capping rates might not be practical, what would be a better way to deal with the problems caused by credit cards? On this front, Australia provides a useful example of policies that have helped to encourage people to use credit card debt more sensibly, and pay less interest as a result. Indeed, over the past decade and a half, the total value of credit card balances that are accruing interest has plunged from about $35 billion to $19.7 billion, Canstar says, while the number of credit card accounts has also fallen. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has said that by late 2022, the total credit card interest paid by consumers had dropped by more than 40 per cent in the previous five years. Card debt remained a problem for many, especially younger people, ASIC said, but consumers have generally cut their balances that are accruing interest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Opinion\n\nInvesting Australia\u2019s big but unloved companies will test investors\u2019 mettle Elizabeth Knight Business columnist The main reasons for this are probably tighter regulation; the support households received in COVID-19 (some of which helped pay down debt); competition from buy now, pay later (BNPL) disruptors; and households being more savvy in how they use their cards. A series of credit card reforms also commenced late last decade, including a ban on unsolicited credit increase offers, the right to request a credit limit reduction and card cancellation online, and tougher responsible lending assessments. Banks have also helped to encourage people to use their cards more sensibly, such as some lenders sending SMS reminders to encourage people to pay off more than the minimum amount. Payments expert Lance Blockley says there are some big differences between Australia\u2019s credit card market and that of the US.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe points out that regulation of lending money in Australia is tighter to due to responsible lending laws, and in the US the card issuers are more generous with the perks they offer customers to encourage them to spend on cards (such as frequent flyer points to reward spending.) The reason it\u2019s easier to get frequent flyer points in the US is once again its lighter approach to regulation \u2013 over the years the Reserve Bank of Australia has cracked down on the fees that fund many of the frequent flyer points in Australia. What\u2019s more, in the US, it\u2019s common for lenders to use \u201crisk based pricing,\u201d which means less creditworthy people are charged higher interest rates because they are riskier to banks and card issuers. All of these factors make credit card interest rates a sensitive topic in the US \u2013 but Blockley says Trump\u2019s \u201crate cap\u201d is unlikely to come into force, and if it does, it won\u2019t necessarily solve the problem. \u201cIf it did get up, it would likely cut a source of credit to people who need it,\u201c Blockley says. \u201cIf you suddenly starve a segment of the American public of credit, you\u2019re likely to see either a drop in retail sales and/or them searching for credit elsewhere.\u201d Australia\u2019s experience suggests tighter regulation of credit cards \u2013 without the need for a rate cap \u2013 has helped to nudge people towards more sensible forms of borrowing on plastic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConsumers are paying far less in credit card interest than they were in the past, and that\u2019s a good thing for households.

In a 434-word social media post, Trump said a 10 per cent tariff would be imposed on any goods sent to the US from Denmark, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries of Norway, Sweden and Finland, starting February 1. A poll last year found 85 per cent of Greenlanders opposed becoming part of the United States. Getty Images The tariff would increase to 25 per cent on June 1 and would be payable until a deal was struck for the \u201ccomplete and total purchase of Greenland\u201d by the US. Trump\u2019s threat provides for two weeks of negotiations \u2013 one of his favourite timeframes when trying to win concessions from other countries \u2013 before the additional tariffs begin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe US president was aggrieved by several European nations \u2013 the eight he singled out for new tariffs \u2013 sending small numbers of troops to Greenland last week in solidarity and to begin a larger permanent military presence on the world\u2019s largest non-continental island. The European effort involving joint military exercises is called Operation Arctic Endurance. French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to dispatch further land, air and sea assets to Greenland in the coming days. French President Emmanuel Macron was among the European leaders who sent military assets to Greenland last week. AP \u201cThis is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet,\u201d Trump said of the moves. \u201cThese Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable.\u201d Macron said he stood by his decision to join the operation and called Trump\u2019s latest tariff threat unacceptable, promising Europe would respond in a united fashion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNo intimidation nor threat will influence us, neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,\u201d Macron said. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Greenland was part of Denmark and its future was a matter for Greenlanders and Danes. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer says hitting allies with tariffs for protecting the security of NATO is \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d. Bloomberg \u201cWe have also made clear that Arctic security matters for the whole of NATO, and allies should all do more together to address the threat from Russia across different parts of the Arctic,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cApplying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong. We will, of course, be pursuing this directly with the US administration.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSwedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson also rejected Trump\u2019s pressure. \u201cWe will not let ourselves be blackmailed,\u201d he posted on X. \u201cOnly Denmark and Greenland decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\u201d The European Union has called on emergency meeting of its national ambassadors to decide on a course of action. It said it stood behind Denmark and Greenland. Greenland Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt (left) and Danish counterpart Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen in Washington last week. AP Trump\u2019s announcement came days after a tense meeting in Washington between US Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland. Trump did not attend. Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, a former prime minister, emerged from the \u201cfrank but constructive\u201d discussion saying that it would be \u201ctotally unacceptable\u201d for the US to disrespect Denmark\u2019s territorial integrity or the Greenlandic people\u2019s right to self-determination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe parties agreed to form a working group to try to break the impasse, but the \u201cfundamental disagreement\u201d remained, Rasmussen said. Conservative Danish politician Rasmus Jarlov, chair of the parliament\u2019s Defence, Resilience and Preparedness Committee, said in response to Trump\u2019s latest threat that Denmark would never hand over Greenland. Thousands demonstrated against a US takeover of Greenland in the Danish capital, Copenhagen. Getty Images \u201cEvery insult, threat, tariff and lie that we receive strengthens our resolve,\u201d Jarlov said on X. \u201cWe pray that our true allies will stand with us because we are going to need it.\u201d A poll last year found 85 per cent of Greenlanders opposed joining the US. The territory\u2019s population is about 56,000, but its location as a northern gateway to North America, and its rich stocks of critical minerals, make it strategically significant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThousands of protesters marched in Copenhagen and Greenland\u2019s capital, Nuuk, on Saturday to reject Trump\u2019s attempts to acquire the territory. In Copenhagen, they chanted \u201cGreenland is not for sale\u201d and held up slogans such as \u201cNo means No\u201d and \u201cHands off Greenland\u201d alongside the territory\u2019s red-and-white flag as they marched to the US embassy. Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen led protests in the territory\u2019s capital, Nuuk, on Saturday. AP One protester carried a sign that said: \u201cYankee go home\u201d, while some attendees wore red, Make America Great Again-style caps that instead read: \u201cMake America Go Away.\u201d In Nuuk, crowds led by Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen carried flags and similar banners as they headed for the US consulate, chanting \u201cKalaallit Nunaat\u201d \u2013 the island\u2019s name in Greenlandic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come here today because I think it\u2019s important to show that Greenland is not for sale,\u201d civil servant Naja Holm told Reuters. \u201cIt is not a toy. This is our home.\u201d The US has made several attempts to buy Greenland since the 19th century. Trump talked about it in his first term, but has made it a bigger priority in his second, especially since Christmas. On Sunday (AEDT), he claimed the US had \u201csubsidised\u201d Denmark and Europe for decades by failing to charge tariffs, and it was time for Denmark to \u201cgive back\u201d. US President Donald Trump says Greenland is vital for US national security. AP \u201cWorld Peace is at stake!\u201d he wrote. \u201cChina and Russia want Greenland, and there is not a thing that Denmark can do about it. They currently have two dogsleds as protection, one added recently. Only the United States of America, under PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP, can play in this game, and very successfully, at that!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump said the US was open to negotiation with Denmark and the rest of Europe. The US\u2019s need to acquire Greenland was especially important due to his plans for a \u201cGolden Dome\u201d, he said, referring to the proposed missile defence system that could also include Canada. Related Article Mining Trump has big hopes for Greenland \u2013 Australia just gave him a reality check Retiring Republican senator Thom Tillis, who was among several US lawmakers who met Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen in Copenhagen this week, said Trump\u2019s response to the European military exercises in Greenland damaged the NATO alliance. \u201cIt\u2019s great for Putin, Xi and other adversaries who want to see NATO divided,\u201d he said on X. \u201cThe fact that a small handful of \u2018advisers\u2019 are actively pushing for coercive action to seize territory of an ally is beyond stupid.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Reuters Get a note directly from our foreign correspondents on what\u2019s making headlines around the world.

The much-anticipated Game of Thrones prequel, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, is being praised as a total success \u2013 \u201ca fresh take\u201d on Westeros that will \u201csatisfy old fans who\u2019d grown restless\u201d. Thankfully, for those of us who tuned out of the Game of Thrones universe, the series works as a standalone show telling a straight-line story of a likeable nobody who comes in to town with his buddy, wanting nothing more than to prove himself. But if you\u2019re feeling reluctant about diving back in, here\u2019s everything you might want to know first. Peter Claffey stars in new Game of Thrones prequel, A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms HBO Max How does this show fit in to the Game of Thrones universe? Same universe, different time. A KOTSK is set in Westeros, the swords-and-sorcery quasi-medieval fantasy land that is the setting for both Game of Thrones and House of the Dragon. We\u2019re roughly 100 years after the events of House of the Dragon and 100 years before Game of Thrones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs it also based on a George R.R. Martin bestseller? Yep, three novellas called The Hedge Knight (1998), The Sworn Sword (2003) and The Mystery Knight (2010). They\u2019re much smaller books than the doorstops that make up the Song of Ice and Fire series. Related Article \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nReview What a relief \u2013 they actually got this Game of Thrones prequel right So is this a much smaller show? It is. Some would say mercifully so. Set largely in a single location at a mid-level jousting tournament, AKOTSK gets six (shorter) episodes to tell the story of our new heroes Dunk (Peter Claffey) and Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell). Dunk is a peasant-born wannabe knight from the slums of Fleabottom who teams up with Egg, a bald stable boy desperate to be his sidekick. Together, they head to the small river town of Ashford Meadow for the big joust-off, hoping to earn their spurs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre there dragons? No. They\u2019ve all died out. If you want to fight at this tournament you do it on a horse. Wait \u2013 those blond-haired bullies who come to the tournament look suspiciously like Targaryens\u2026 They are. Baelor Breakspear Targaryen (Bertie Carvel), the heir to the throne, is here. And he\u2019s joined by his brother Maekar Targaryen (Sam Spruell), cousin Valarr (Oscar Morgan) and Maekar\u2019s pantomime villain son Aerion \u2018Brightflame\u2019 (Finn Bennett). The Targaryens think that the joust at Ashford Meadow is a bit beneath them but without their dragons the family needs to play nice with its subjects, so decides to play along. They spend most of AKOTSK wishing they were somewhere else.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDon\u2019t I know that guy? You mean Finn Bennett? Yes, he was the breakout star of HBO\u2019s True Detective: Night Country. Or did you mean Bertie Carvel? He was Tony Blair in The Crown. Or perhaps you meant Daniel Ings, who was in The Crown, Sex Education and The Gentleman. Anyways, you get the idea: HBO has stacked AKOTSK full of top-notch British acting talent, just as it did with Game of Thrones. Oh, just Brits? And one crucial Aussie! Perth\u2019s Tanzyn Crawford plays Tanselle \u2018Too-Tall,\u2019 a puppeteer who turns Ser Duncan\u2019s head (and not just because they\u2019re both tall). Peter Claffey and Australian Tanzyn Crawford in A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms HBO Max\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWho else will I know from Game of Thrones? You\u2019ll also recognise the name Baratheon. Ings plays Ser Lyonel Baratheon, known as The Laughing Storm, a man who knows how to get a party started. Elsewhere, there are Fossoways (last seen in Game of Thrones season two) and Dondarrions (Beric was a key Game of Thrones player), but mostly this is about Ser Duncan the Tall and his squire Egg. Peter Claffey and Dexter Sol Ansell star in A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms HBO Max How tall is Duncan the Tall? In the books Dunk is written as 6\u2032 10\u2033 (2 metres) but Peter Claffey who plays him is 6\u2032 5\u2033. He\u2019s still a bruiser though \u2013 before he became an actor, Claffey played rugby union in the second row for Ireland.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s the tournament they\u2019re all attending? It\u2019s a five-lane mega joust in which knights strap on 60 pounds of armour, jump on a horse, pick up a 15-foot wooden pole and then charge at the other guy to knock him off his mount. Initially, it\u2019s a \u201cjoust of peace\u201d, a fun-for-all-the-family sports event where no one is meant to get hurt. But this is the Game of Thrones universe, so you know it\u2019s going to turn nasty. Related Article Streaming \u2018An expensive and clunky footnote\u2019: House of the Dragon improves, but is it actually good? Why did they choose this chunk of George R.R. Martin\u2019s massive oeuvre for the next TV adaptation? In part to keep Martin happy. He\u2019s always said that the Dunk and Egg stories are his favourites. Also, Martin has criticised House of the Dragon for moving away from his source material, so this is a chance for HBO to show that they can stick to his script.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also a good script to stick to \u2013 the Dunk and Egg novellas are funny, rely on a single point of view and show a spit-and-sawdust version of Westeros that feels new. There\u2019s a feeling that viewers are a little punch drunk from 10 years of highborn machiavellians plotting to rule the world with huge armies and week-long battles. AKOTSK is a definite change of approach. Okay, I think I\u2019m in. But what sort of commitment are we talking here? Game of Thrones went on for ages\u2026 Though this first season is just six episodes long, the show has already been renewed for a second season, with production under way in Ireland. Season two is expected in 2027. Whether we get more than that will, once again, depend on Martin. \u201cThe big issue is that I have only written three novellas, and I have a lot more stories about Dunk and Egg in my f---ing head,\u201d he recently told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI\u2019ve got to get them down on paper\u201d.

See all stories .\n\nOPERA\n\nTurandot\n\nOpera Australia\n\nJoan Sutherland Theatre, Opera House, January 15\n\nUntil March 27\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd In Opera Australia\u2019s new production of Puccini\u2019s last (and incomplete) opera, Turandot, director Ann Yee and designers Elizabeth Gadsby (set), David Fleischer (costumes) and Paul Jackson (video) have placed a magnificent trio of principals, Rebecca Nash (Turandot), Young Woo Kim (Calaf) and Maria Teresa Leva (Liu), in a dark dystopia of the mind. Everyone wears the same drab blue and grey (except Turandot who first appears in pristine white). The walls and fabric have creeping dark patches at the edges like mould suffocating the soul, while a projected video-game avatar lurks on the back wall, blinking creepily. Rebecca Nash as Turandot. Keith Saunders Side-stepping the original\u2019s racist stereotypes, Ping, Pong and Pang (Luke Gabbedy, John Longmuir, Michael Petruccelli) become P1, P2 and P3, cynical techno-geeks whose retro-technology inure them from reality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCentral to Yee\u2019s conception is to make the ancestor who spurs Turandot\u2019s hostility towards men, Lou-Ling, into an embodied character \u2013 a dancer (Hoyori Maruo), whose writhing convulsive movements return at salient moments. Although the silent dance before the music began had moments of awkwardness, it placed the persona firmly in the listener\u2019s mind as a driver of action. When Lou-Ling unites with the gentle Liu, \u201cso good, so sweet\u201d, at the end, the message is clear: it is the suffering of both that creates healing from intergenerational trauma. Young Woo Kim as Calaf. Keith Saunders In this context, the problematic final scene (completed by the composer Adami from Puccini\u2019s sketches) was meaningful where it is often ineffective (though one wonders if Puccini himself would have shortened it to create more verismo impact after the emotional climax of Liu\u2019s death). Conductor Henrik Nanasi maintained dramatic momentum incisively up to that poignant moment, so the score moved forward with the decisiveness of the story, while leaving ample flexibility for the singers to expand expressive moments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Calaf, Kim sang with gorgeous, richly tanned velvety colours and stentorian strength that he seemed able to push to the limits without cracking the beautifully burnished finish. He leavened the soaring lines of Nessun Dorma with phrases of quieter nuance to give classic shape to this most famous of moments and, more broadly, created a rounded character, which avoided pushing Calaf\u2019s forceful dominance too far into wearying and overbearing self-centredness. Nash was every bit his equal as Turandot, matching his tone in the riddle scene with vivid dramatic colours and riveting, almost frightening, intensity, which she transformed to a softer glow in the final scene. Leva captured both simplicity and depth as Liu singing with light charm in Act 1 and allowing more full-blooded passion into the sound in Act 3. Her most memorable note was the high B flat in her first aria, which emerged like a quiet truth in a mist of melancholy. Richard Anderson was a poignant Timur giving well-shaped lines unvarnished eloquence. As the three Ps, Gabbedy, Longmuir and Petruccelli provided sarcastic comic counterpoint, sustaining Puccini\u2019s slightly overlong scene in Act II strongly, with well-articulated vocal lines and witty deflection, as though responsible for the running of the machinery of a surveillance state. In fading respectable skivvy and slacks Gregory Brown sang the Emperor\u2019s role with frail clarity like one keen to return to his retirement village, while Shane Lowrencev made the Speaker\u2019s role into a mindless vehicle of autocratic edicts. Placed on a revolving stage with static symbolic movements, the Opera Australia Chorus sang with vivid openness, subtlety and power to bind together these fragments of the excesses of human passion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDANCE\n\nEXXY\n\nSydney Opera House, Drama Theatre\n\nJanuary 15\n\nUntil January 18\n\nReviewed by KATIE LAWRENCE\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Think of something in the world that makes you question the future of humanity. I\u2019ll wait.\n\n(Actually, I won\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019d be here all night.) Whatever came to mind, Dan Daw\u2019s Exxy is the antidote. Exxy is a dance-theatre love letter to the best of us: to survival, to tenderness, and to a tiny boy with cerebral palsy and his ballsy Nan, belting out The Power of Love into the red dust of the outback. It is hilarious, ferocious, devastating \u2013 and somehow also an incredible night out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDan Daw is resplendent in a tank top and kilt. Neil Bennett The action unfolds against corrugated iron, framed by deck chairs and the vast Australian landscape. The cast of four (Daw, Tiiu Mortley, Joseph Brown and Sofia Valdiri) are stunning. Monologues and movement land like gut-punches, then pull you in for a hug. From the jump, Exxy commits hard to inclusion. Participation isn\u2019t just welcome; it\u2019s actively directed via flashing overhead captions. Don\u2019t panic. I have never enjoyed being gently bossed around by a show more, including the singalong (no spoilers, but it goes off). The costumes and sets (by Kat Heath) are Mad Max survival chic: industrial greys, bodies braced for impact. It\u2019s battle gear with a forehead kiss. Daw is resplendent in a tank top and kilt, tattoos on full display. His solos are breathtaking in their intelligence and clarity; the definition of a dancer working with his body. Guy Connelly\u2019s soundtrack ranges from lilting melodies to techno thuds, matching the movement. The stage is carpeted in saltbush and light. Daw\u2019s metaphor is clear: saltbush doesn\u2019t just survive; it bursts through concrete.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExxy is packed with camp, gleeful absurdity. Neil Bennett Exxy doesn\u2019t sugarcoat. It tells stories of sexual rejection and casual cruelty: doors slammed in faces; turning up for a hookup only to be asked to leave after undressing; encounters with people who need someone else kneeling in order to feel tall. Don\u2019t be misled into thinking Exxy is solemn. It is packed with camp, gleeful absurdity \u2013 performers on all fours, drooling onto the stage; a \u201cwho\u2019s better at cerebral palsy\u201d battle that ends in applause; a group marathon where the destination is unclear but the vibe is unadulterated \u201cI got you.\u201d Exxy is 90 minutes in a room full of people who vocally have your back. Like saltbush, Exxy doesn\u2019t ask for permission to take up space. It insists on participation, demands tenderness \u2013 and turns the theatre into an intimate, raucous, glorious celebration of being alive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDANCE\n\nSave the Last Dance for Me\n\nPalm Grove, Sydney Town Hall, & Leichhardt Town Hall\n\nJanuary 15\n\nUntil January 23\n\nReviewed by CHANTAL NGUYEN\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd In Save the Last Dance for Me, a white dance floor is marked out with masking tape in a diamond pattern. A slow, electro-swing beat begins (Aurora Bauz\u00e0 and Pere Jou\u2019s soundscape), and two men pace onto the dance floor (Gianmaria Borzillo and Giovanfrancesco Giannini). They both have neat, toned physiques; upright posture; slick fashionable clothes; and impassive facial expressions. Stylistically, they are clearly European contemporary dance artists. Gianmaria Borzillo and Giovanfrancesco Giannini. Stephen Wilson Barker But the dance itself has more earthy roots. It is the polka chinata, a folk dance from Bologna, Italy when early-1900s social norms prohibited men from dancing with unmarried women. So the men danced with each other, exerting to attract female attention with the polka chinata\u2019s rapid complexity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBorzillo and Giannini slowly grasp each other in a ballroom embrace, their bodies gently lifting like two lungs inhaling. A pause like a wave cresting, then they begin gliding down each arm of the diamond, their feet moving in a swift, syncopated pattering step. The travelling step becomes hypnotic in its speed and liquid intricacy. One false move and the dance would meet the kind of tangled end you see in cycling race pile-ups. Related Series\n\nSydney Festival Sydney Festival 2026 But Borzillo and Giannini never misstep, their bodies moving with such smooth, disciplined synchrony that it is like watching one entity rather than two (interestingly, the two male bodies are far more visually uniform than ballroom dancing\u2019s usual male-female pairing). There are dizzying spins and a remarkable scooching turn, where Borzillo and Giannini grasp each other\u2019s biceps, crouch down, and begin to whirl. When the choreographer, Venice Golden Lion-winner Alessandro Sciarroni, first learnt about the polka chinata, you could count on one hand the number of couples who still knew how to dance it. He sent Borzillo and Giannini to Bologna to learn the dying artform. That effort led to this extraordinary piece, a rediscovery of a folk dance form, beatified and resurrected in a modern, fine arts setting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA smile breaks through Borzillo\u2019s face, his neat shirt now drenched with sweat. As they break through a wall of exhaustion, the audience begins clapping along, uplifted by the combination of tradition and modernity. Passers-by linger, entranced. The finale is a joyous crescendo of movement, with grins all round. With Canadian import Kris Nelson directing this year\u2019s Sydney Festival, the dance offerings have been exceptionally strong. At just 30 minutes, Save the Last Dance for Me is a clear winner. Get the day\u2019s breaking news, entertainment ideas and a long read to enjoy. Sign up to receive our Evening Edition newsletter.",

But now it\u2019s Australian Open time, and you can\u2019t get enough of it. Let us bring you up to speed.\n\nWho is the men\u2019s No.1, and what is \u2018Sincaraz\u2019?\n\nCarlos Alcaraz (world No.1) and Jannik Sinner (No.2) are dominating the men\u2019s game. And they took their stranglehold to a new level in 2025 \u2013 thanks, in part, to a ridiculously good Roland Garros final won by Alcaraz that lasted five hours and 29 minutes.\n\nSome of the top seeds at the 2026 Australian Open.
