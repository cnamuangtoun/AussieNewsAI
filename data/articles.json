        "text": "An \"unconstitutional\"\ufeff law that stripped citizenship from South African dual nationals has been reversed \u2013 and the implications have sent a ripple of confusion and alarm throughout the expat community.\n\nThe South African Citizenship Act (Act 88 of 1995) previously required South Africans to seek ministerial permission to retain their citizenship before becoming citizens of another country, including Australia.\n\nAnyone who failed to do so would lose their citizenship \u2013 until now.\n\nSouth Africans who became citizens of another country without ministerial permission after 1995 automatically lost their SA citizenship. (Getty)\n\nCitizenship restoration is now in full swing after a court ruled this provision was unconstitutional and invalid in May 2025.\n\nIt is not automatic and eligible expats need to use the reinstatement portal.\n\nIt only applies to those who have lost their citizenship on or after 6 October 1995, according to the South African High Commission.\n\nThere were 214,790 South African-born people living in Australia as of 2023, according to the Australian Department of Home Affairs.\n\nREAD MORE: Residents in fear after teenagers invited to planned mass bike rideout in Sydney\n\nWhat is the dual citizenship law in South Africa?\n\nReinstated citizens \u2013 including those who retained their citizenship prior to the rule change \u2013 are required to enter and exit South Africa using a South African passport\ufeff, a rule similar to the ETA scheme soon coming into effect in Britain.\n\nThis has been the entry and exit requirement in South Africa since 2004.\ufeff\n\nIt may impact thousands\ufeff of Australian-South African dual citizens who wish to resume their citizenship after their SA passports expired.\n\nThe Australian government's Smartraveller advice\ufeff states that \"if you hold Australian-South African dual nationality, by law you must enter and exit on your South African passport\".\n\n\"We recommend all possible dual nationals consult the South African Department of Home Affairs website to verify your citizenship status,\" Smartraveller noted.\n\nThe SA High Commission also states the same on its website.\ufeff\n\nMost other visitors, including those from Australia, the US, UK, Canada and New Zealand, don't need a visa for tourist or business stays under 90 days.\n\nHayley Reichert, a South African-born expat and advocate living in London, initiated the \"Loss of Citizenship Campaign\" in 2014, which eventually led to last year's court ruling.\n\nReichert told nine.com.au there is now \"significant confusion\" around South African expats hoping to return home on foreign passports after the resumption of their citizenship.\n\nHayley Reichert is a passionate advocate for South Africans living abroad. (Supplied)\n\nShe runs a voluntary initiative supporting South Africans abroad named Operation Watershed and has been working to help expats with this constitutional change.\n\n\"Many now fear the issuance of fines, detention, refusal of travel, and even the threat of imprisonment,\" Reichert said.\n\n\"This climate of anxiety is disproportionate to the actual legal and practical reality.\"\n\nWhat happens if my South African passport has expired?\n\nThe law states that citizens must have a valid South African passport or proof of renunciation of citizenship to enter or exit.\n\nHowever, Reichert has called for calm among expats.\n\nShe said South African border control has a \"degree of institutional understanding\" over the challenges now faced by dual nationals.\n\n\ufeffThere may not be blanket punitive enforcement of this rule, she explained.\n\n\"In theory, repeat non-compliance can result in fines or prosecution (up to 12 months' imprisonment), but in practice this is extremely rare,\" Reichert said.\n\n\"Most individuals resolve their documentation after a first warning.\"\n\nThe Embassy of the Republic of South Africa said the department acknowledges that many dual citizens may not be aware of the amendment to the act and the implications for their travel.\n\n\"We have therefore decided that affected South Africans departing or arriving through our ports of entry, attempting to use a foreign passport, will be issued with a warning giving them three months to obtain a South African passport,\" it stated in a notice.\n\n\"They will be allowed to depart or enter South Africa.\"\n\nYou don't need a visa if you're visiting South Africa for tourism purposes for up to 90 days. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\"In many cases, travellers receive a formal warning and stamp in their foreign passport noting that South African citizens are not permitted to enter or exit on foreign passports and are instructed to regularise their South African documents,\" Reichert added.\n\nReichert encouraged South Africans living abroad\ufeff to do their research and contact the relevant authorities before booking or cancelling trips over this entry requirement.\n\nShe said dual citizens had a responsibility to comply with the law \ufeff\u2013 but called for calm amid \"confusion, anxiety and misinformation\".\n\nCan Australian-born children get South African citizenship?\n\nThe SA High Commission states that a child born outside of South Africa to at least one parent with South African citizenship has a claim to citizenship by descent.\n\nThey must register the birth in South Africa to obtain citizenship.",

        "text": "When Brooklyn Beckham chose Instagram to air his grievances amid reports of a rift within the Beckham family, it was easy to dismiss the move as impulsive.\n\nBut crisis and reputation experts say the decision \u2014 and the British family's response \u2014 points to a far more calculated approach to managing public fallout in the age of social media.\n\n\"Everything about it is strategic,\" Susan Grantham, a reputation management expert at Griffith University, said.\n\n\"This isn't a 26-year-old randomly deciding to post something. It's been orchestrated to contribute to a specific narrative,\" Dr Grantham said.\n\n\"Nothing goes out on social media, particularly when you're part of a very famous family, without it being checked over and thought through.\"\n\nBrooklyn Beckham claimed his parents had tried to \"ruin\" his relationship with his now wife, Nicola Peltz Beckham. (Reuters: Aude Guerrucci)\n\nBrooklyn \u2014 the eldest son of ex-professional footballer Sir David Beckham and former Spice Girls member Lady Victoria Beckham \u2014 posted to Instagram Stories last week saying he did not want to reconcile with his family.\n\nHe accused his parents of being \"controlling\" and claimed they had tried to \"ruin\" his relationship with his now wife, American actress Nicola Peltz Beckham.\n\nThe message, shared in a format that disappears after 24 hours, quickly spread beyond social media through screenshots and reposts.\n\nAccording to US-based crisis communications strategist Molly McPherson, who hosts the PR Breakdown podcast, that amplification was no accident.\n\n\"Brooklyn Beckham is piercing his family with an arrow,\" she said.\n\n\"Everybody is going to his Stories and clicking on him and following him \u2014 so now he's getting the engagement.\"\n\nThe episode, experts say, shows how younger generations are increasingly shaping crisis narratives on their own terms \u2014 and often before traditional media can frame them.\n\nStories, not statements\n\nDr Grantham says Brooklyn's decision to speak directly to followers rather than through a spokesperson reflects a fundamental shift in how crises now unfold.\n\n\"We're in a unique moment where different generations expect to be communicated with in different ways,\" she said.\n\n\"Youth audiences expect correspondence through social media, so responding in the same environment where the drama is occurring is now standard practice.\"\n\nBrooklyn Beckham took to Instagram to reveal he does not want to reconcile with his family. (Instagram @brooklynpeltzbeckham)\n\nBy choosing Instagram Stories \u2014 a format that disappears within a day \u2014 Brooklyn was also shaping how long the messaging was intended to live.\n\n\"There's exclusivity to the content,\" Dr Grantham said. \"His obvious intention was for this to go live and disappear. I've had my word and that's it.\"\n\nWhile the posts were quickly screen-recorded and shared elsewhere, she said the temporary nature of the format still carried symbolic weight.\n\n\"It told a very specific story \u2014 that he wanted to say something once and only once, which I think made it more intriguing.\"\n\nMs McPherson said the timing of the posts \u2014 just before Sir David attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland \u2014 was also likely deliberate.\n\n\"I think Brooklyn knew precisely where his father was, and that his father would be ambushed on this.\"\n\nSaying something without saying anything\n\nDays later, Sir David was asked at the World Economic Forum about parenting in the age of social media, offering an indirect answer that avoided addressing the family dispute head-on.\n\n\"Children are allowed to make mistakes, that's how they learn. So that's what I try to teach my kids,\" he said during a broader discussion on a CNBC panel.\n\n\"But you know, you have to sometimes let them make those mistakes as well.\"\n\nSir David Beckham avoided addressing the family dispute head-on. (AP Photo: Markus Schreiber)\n\nMs McPherson believes the exchange was carefully managed.\n\n\"There is no doubt in my mind that the Beckham team, their PR handlers, worked with CNBC and there was a deal made,\" she said.\n\n\"The deal made was this: David will sit down and do this interview with you, but you have to serve him this opener.\"\n\nDr Grantham said Sir David's oblique approach was deliberate.\n\n\"It's a technique where you embed a particular story into an existing narrative, but allow others to make sense of it in the way they wish,\" she said.\n\n\"He obviously wanted to say something, but didn't want to say anything. Given the question he was asked, he handled it reasonably well.\"\n\nShe said carefully chosen language allowed audiences to draw their own conclusions \u2014 without the risk that came with explicit engagement.\n\n\" He said particular words that allowed people to make connections that maybe didn't explicitly exist. \"\n\nBoth experts said the episode highlighted a generational split in how the Beckham family managed public narratives.\n\n\"We've seen the first move out of the gate was throw Brooklyn under the bus,\" McPherson said.\n\n\"We're going to give [his parents] a little bit of leeway here because they became big global brands during the 90s when the tabloid media culture was brutal.\"\n\nA billion-dollar brand under scrutiny\n\nThe Beckham brand is reportedly worth close to $1 billion. (Reuters: Gonzalo Fuentes)\n\nAmong the most damaging claims, Brooklyn accused his mother of hijacking his first dance with his wife at their wedding.\n\n\"She danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone,\" he said in one of the posts.\n\n\"I've never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life.\"\n\nThe family dispute has played out against the backdrop of the Beckham name as a global brand spanning football, fashion, beauty and media \u2014 reportedly worth close to $1 billion.\n\nDespite the headlines, Dr Grantham said large, established brands were often far more resilient to this kind of internal dispute than might be expected.\n\n\"Bizarrely, they're not heavily affected,\" she said.\n\n\" The bigger the brand, the more likely something like this draws attention rather than destroys it. \"\n\nUnlike smaller organisations, which can suffer reputational collapse in a matter of hours, she says high-profile brands can absorb controversy.\n\n\"Something like this is creating intrigue more than huge negativity,\" she said.\n\n\"There's the memes, the humour, the 'he said, she said'. All of that keeps people engaged.\"\n\nExperts say the feud has driven further engagement with the Beckham brand. (Instagram: @memes)\n\nShe points to companies like Samsung \u2014 which survived the crisis of exploding phones \u2014 as an example of how scale and effective narrative management can blunt reputational damage.\n\n\"If you're a big enough brand and you handle the crisis well enough, people continue to engage with the story rather than abandon the brand.\"\n\nThat engagement has taken unexpected forms, with a solo single Lady Victoria released more than two decades ago briefly topping the UK and Ireland iTunes charts after resurfacing online during the controversy.\n\nStrategic silence\n\nWhile others \u2014 including a DJ and social media users \u2014 continued to fuel speculation about the feud, the Beckham family itself largely stepped back.\n\nThat, Dr Grantham said, may be the most revealing part of the strategy.\n\n\"They really haven't done a lot to create any further narrative. They've taken a step back and just allowed the story to live,\" she said.\n\nAre celebrity family rifts validating or potentially damaging? Celebrity family rifts are not new. Experts weigh in on how they can spark negative feelings about our own family dynamics.\n\nFor now, Dr Grantham believes that restraint is working.\n\n\"If the story became excessively negative, that's where crisis managers would step in and advise them to address it differently. But right now, it's not doing them any damage.\"\n\nMs McPherson said the Beckham brand would \"100 per cent\" survive but argued Sir David and Lady Victoria may need to lean more heavily into their individual identities.\n\n\"If they were working with me, I would have said something to the effect of: 'We love our son but like all families, we've made mistakes, and we don't want to cash in on his pain.'\n\n\"That's what they need to do. But will they do it? I don't know.\"\n\nThe broader lesson is clear: in modern crises, control doesn't always come from speaking louder \u2014 but from knowing when, where and how briefly to speak at all.",

(ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nIn 2021, the City of Darwin committed $30 million to the redevelopment of its civic centre building, and in 2024 its budget was increased to $78.5 million as part of the council's 2030 municipal plan.\n\nAccording to the council's latest financial figures from December, the council has spent $19.5 million on the project since its consultation phase in 2022, with about $11 million of that spent in the past year.\n\nThe project's current budget stands at $77.6 million, with an additional $2 million set aside for \"project contingency\" costs.\n\nConstruction is underway in the CBD as the Darwin Civic Centre project progresses. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nCr Styles said council spending on other projects, including the as-yet-undisclosed cost of the Cyclone Fina clean-up, would \"not at all\" be impacted by the civic centre outlay.\n\n\"Money allocated to [the civic centre redevelopment] comes from various sources within council, and also from the approval of the territory government, so that's all covered,\" he said.\n\n\" The council still has a budget for other capital works. \"\n\nAmong other projects the council has budgeted for in 2025-26 is $10 million for the expansion of the Darwin tip and $3 million for a recreation space in the city's northern suburbs.\n\nDevelopments, Construction, Operations and Hospitality (DCOH) is working to deliver the Darwin CBD project. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nLease negotiations underway for the CBD's 'Paris End'\n\nDCOH chief operations officer Lachlan Michell said construction of the civic centre building was expected to be completed in 2028, with levels 15 and 16 set to be in place by January 2027.\n\nHe said the installation of a Lubeca Jumpform system at the worksite had marked a major milestone.\n\n\"[It's] a hydraulic jacking system that will constantly progress up the building until you get to level 21. That's where the lift core and the stairs are,\" he said.\n\nLachlan Michell says DCOH is working to secure tenants for the upper floors of the building. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nOnce completed, DCOH will own the upper 10 floors of the building, which Mr Michell said the company planned to lease out as office space.\n\n\"We're actively working with potential tenants on that, we've got leasing proposals out for I think five floors at the moment, and there's some really strong interest, not just locally but interstate,\" he said.\n\nSince 2025, the building's leasing agent NTC Property has been advertising about 11,000 square metres of available space on the civic centre's upper floors, which it describes as \"positioned in the prestigious eastern precinct of the CBD, often referred to as the 'Paris End'\".\n\nAn NTC Property representative declined to provide a price range for the leases, but said the company was \"hoping to achieve premium rents\".\n\nThe new Darwin Civic Centre will scale 21 storeys and is expected to be completed by 2028. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nMr Michell said the project remained on schedule despite last year's Cyclone Fina, wet season conditions and the serious injury of a worker at the construction site last month.\n\nThe incident, in which a 50-year-old worker suffered an injury to his arm after being struck by a falling excavator bucket, led to NT WorkSafe issuing a safety alert.\n\nMr Michell said DCOH had notified NT WorkSafe within minutes of the incident and was cooperating with the regulator.\n\n\"We're pleased to report [the worker] is doing well; he got some medical treatment and is working through that, he's in good spirits and we're working with the subcontractor to make sure he returns to work,\" he said.\n\nCurrent council chambers to be demolished\n\nThe City of Darwin has confirmed that its current council chambers will be either fully or partly demolished after the new civic centre is built, with chief executive Simone Saunders saying that was \"always part of the process\".\n\nShe said consultations to be held this year would inform what happened to the site once the current chambers were demolished, emphasising the need to preserve a 100-year-old Banyan tree in the building's courtyard.\n\nSimone Saunders says the new build is an exciting development for Darwin. (ABC News: Pete Garnish)\n\nMs Saunders said 400 square metres of the new civic centre's lower floors had been earmarked for \"community-commercial\" spaces.\n\n\"That might be some arts and cultural [organisations], and also some commercial organisations that also need a small retail footprint\" she said.\n\n\"Community wants to see more spaces where they can gather for meetings and have discussions, and maybe even pop-up art installations.\"",

        "text": "Like Roman soldiers, tennis gladiators Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic are vowing no surrender after setting up an Australian Open final for the ages.\n\nSeparated by 16 years in age but sharing the same unbreakable will, wizardry skills and desire, Alcaraz and Djokovic are fighting for a special place in the sporting record books tonight.\n\nRod Laver Arena will be the two combatants' colosseum as 22-year-old Alcaraz strives to become the youngest man to complete a fabled career grand slam and Djokovic, at almost 39, bids for an unprecedented 25th singles major.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher.\n\nNovak Djokovic found the energy to beat Jannik Sinner in five sets. (Getty Images: Darrian Traynor)\n\n\"Obviously for Carlos, because of his age and everything that he was able to achieve so far, history is on the line for both of us every time we play,\" Djokovic said after winding back the clock and ending the title defence of two-time champion Jannik Sinner at almost 2:00am yesterday.\n\n\"The finals of a grand slam, you know, there's a lot at stake, but it's no different from any other big match that I play.\n\n\"My preparation is as it should be, and I won against him last year here, also in a gruelling (quarter-final) match. Let's see. Let's see how fresh are we both able to be.\"\n\nDjokovic hits out at critics Novak Djokovic sets his sights on those who doubted whether he could still be an Australian Open contender.\n\nDjokovic needed four hours and nine minutes to see Sinner off, saving 16 of 18 break points in what may have been the finest clutch display of the super Serb's incomparable career.\n\nThe seismic victory took an immeasurable physical and mental toll, with Djokovic offering \"no predictions\" of how his body will recover.\n\nBut, driven by the doubters, the former world number one is only promising one last stand in pursuit of the exclamation mark to the most decorated CV in men's tennis history.\n\n\"He also had a big match, but he has 15, 16 years on me,\" Djokovic said of Alcaraz's own five-hour, 27-minute five-set semi-final triumph earlier on Friday over Alexander Zverev.\n\n\"Biologically, it's going to be a bit easier for him to recover. But, yeah, I look forward to it.\n\n\"Look, I play tennis competitively mainly to be able to reach the finals of grand slams. Here I am, so I cannot complain about anything.\"\n\nAlready a six-time time major winner, boasting two titles each from Wimbledon and the French and US Opens, Alcaraz is contesting his first final at Melbourne Park.\n\nDjokovic is playing his 11th on Rod Laver Arena, his personal battle ground where no man has conquered the Serb in a title match and where Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray, Dominic Thiem, Daniil Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga have all fallen on their swords trying.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz was titanic in overcoming Alexander Zverev in the semifinals. (Getty Images: Darrian Traynor)\n\nAlcaraz, though, shapes as the Melbourne Park king's fiercest challenger yet, having already dethroned Djokovic at Wimbledon and shown in fighting through cramps to deny Zverev that he does not know when or how to yield.\n\n\"I just hate giving up. Just how I could feel after all. I just don't want to feel that way,\" the indomitable Spaniard said after battling back from 5-3 down in the deciding set against the German third seed.\n\nAlcaraz prevails in ultimate match of margins The margins can prove to be razor-thin when it comes to the business end of grand slam tournaments. Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev found out firsthand in an all-time classic.\n\n\"There are some moments that it seems like, 'OK, I'm just giving up or just I'm not fighting at all', which, when I was younger, there were a lot of matches that I just didn't want to fight anymore or just I gave up.\n\n\"Then I just got mature, and I just hate that feeling after all.\n\n\"(Now I'm) thinking I could do it or I could do a little bit more or I could suffer a little bit more, that feeling of just kill myself.\n\n\"Every step more, every just one second more of suffering, one second more of fighting is always worth it.\n\n\"So that's why I just fight until the last ball and always believe that I can come back in every situation.\"\n\nOn age and form, Alcaraz is the favourite.\n\nBut he was the fancy at Roland Garros too in 2024 when Djokovic defied the experts to complete the golden slam with an against-the-odds Olympics final triumph on the Paris clay against the reigning French Open champ.\n\nNow Alcaraz, the current world number one, is in Djokovic's house trying to add the final piece of his own storied slam.\n\nBoth want it bad, but only one can prevail.\n\n\"I would choose this one,\" Alcaraz said of the trophy he craves most.\n\n\"Yeah, if I make the final of the other three, I would say I would rather win this one than the three and complete the grand slam and be the youngest ever to do it.\"\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

        "text": "On a cold Ballarat winter's day, Billy Harraway-Jones decided to uncover the story of his family home.\n\nWhat he found was a saga of courtship and marriage in a new world, and of life and death on the Australian goldfields.\n\nMr Harraway-Jones had at his disposal an internet connection and patience.\n\nWith access to online databases and local council records, he slowly pieced together a history of the house.\n\nThe tools are there for anyone to use.\n\nBilly Harraway-Jones opened the door on his family home's history. (ABC News: Gavin McGrath)\n\n\"I grew up in my parents' house in Lydiard Street, and you always knew that, even though you think of it as your house from your perspective as a kid, many of those houses in that street are over 100 years old,\" he said.\n\n\"There's been multiple different people cycle through that house.\n\n\" The weather had been miserable and, I thought, 'I've got a bit of time, why not do something different, and find out about those people?' \"\n\nMr Harraway-Jones had been told the home's first owner was William John Payne.\n\nIt turned out it was William's father-in-law, Cornish immigrant Philip Williams, and that the metaphorical \"ghosts\" of the house were older than he suspected.\n\nWilliam courted and married Elizabeth Williams, then aged 18, in August 1866, and eventually moved in.\n\nBefore long, Mr Harraway-Jones found himself scanning marriage certificates from Cornwall and delving into a family history 17,000 kilometres away.\n\nBilly Harroway-Jones says local historical societies can offer further insights. (ABC News: Gavin McGrath)\n\nIntriguing tales\n\nThere are grand old buildings across Australia with great histories and many proverbial ghosts to be discovered.\n\nHowever, even comparatively modest places have an intriguing tale to tell, Gippsland historian Linda Barraclough said.\n\nHistorical ownership records exist even for abandoned properties. (Supplied: Greg Davis, Explored Visions)\n\n\"Houses do not have to be big and grand to be worth researching,\" Ms Barraclough said.\n\n\"Sometimes the humblest tell the more interesting stories.\n\n\"They do not even have to be that old.\"\n\nMs Barraclough said good examples were houses used immediately following World War II.\n\n\"The worker housing immediately after the Second World War, like the Australian Paper Manufacturing houses in Traralgon, prefabricated railway houses in Traralgon, SEC houses in Yallourn and in Newborough,\" she said.\n\n\"They were called 'snail houses' because one SEC executive said if workers are going to be recruited [from the United Kingdom], they were going to have to bring their homes with them. Even sawmilling houses can have fascinating histories.\"\n\nTreasure trove of history\n\nYou don't need to be a professional historian to begin tracing your old house's history.\n\nMr Harraway-Jones's first steps towards discovering the deeper history of his home were made on Trove, an online database owned by the National Library of Australia that catalogues Australian newspapers, government archives, library records and museum documents and manuscripts.\n\nThe National Library of Australia's Trove research portal can be searched online. (ABC News: Gavin McGrath)\n\n\"Just going through Trove, reading [old newspaper] articles, there wasn't too much, but what you do is you find a bit of a trail,\" Mr Harraway-Jones said.\n\n\"You may potentially find a birth or death notice, for example, and that's enough to start putting the pieces together and working out your next source.\"\n\nMs Barraclough described Trove as \"a game changer\".\n\nWhile libraries had extensive records in bound volumes or microfiche (microfilm), Trove enabled near-instant searches of names, places and even keywords that may appear in news articles or other documents.\n\n\"There's a high percentage of newspapers that you can read online back to their beginnings and the brilliant thing is they're searchable,\" Ms Barraclough said.\n\n\"It's not only newspapers. It's got a lot of maps, it's got a lot of books and a huge cache of photographs, and it's just changed research completely.\n\n\"You can sit at home and do it on your computer.\"\n\nA 1939 sewerage map from the Maffra Sugarbeet Museum collection. (Supplied: Maffra Sugarbeet Museum)\n\nTracking down the title\n\nAnother good place to start is the property's title history, which can be accessed online through Land Registry Services in NSW or Landata in Victoria.\n\nA title history search statement lists the names of current and previous owners, dates of sale and mortgage discharge information.\n\nA property's title history report can be obtained from each state's land registry service. (ABC News: Gavin McGrath)\n\nMr Harraway-Jones said those basics could then be used to expand a search within a local area or parish.\n\n\"You can then start searching things like council documents,\" Mr Harraway-Jones said.\n\n\"We've got really good digitalised rates records in the Ballarat Library or you can view them online.\n\n\" That can tell you a lot about who lived there. You get their surname, occupation, whether or not they just owned it and rented it out or if they lived in it, and then you start putting a picture together. \"\n\nOnce armed with these essentials, Ms Barraclough said local historical societies and clubs, and even groups on social media could help colour in the details of what life was like for past owners and residents.\n\nThe history of old Australian homes can be accessed online. (ABC News: Gavin McGrath)\n\nDetours and dead ends\n\nMr Harraway-Jones said there were a few hiccups along the way.\n\nThe property had several street number changes over its history, which had to be navigated through council records before he was able to lock down an address.\n\nHowever, having sketched out a timeline of the house's history, he said he was confident he could do it for any old house in Australia \u2014 and that anyone else with sufficient diligence and tenacity could too.\n\nMr Harraway-Jones said his home had seen many ups and downs over its 146-year history.\n\n\"My father used to joke, 'This house is so old, someone's probably died here,'\" he said.\n\n\"This all confirmed what my dad used to say. Multiple people died there, but at least a few were born as well.\"\n\nBilly Harraway-Jones used Trove to help discover details about his home.

        "text": "A growing number of workers at several Ningaloo Reef tour operators say they were underpaid and overworked in the seasonal roles that prop up the tourist hotspot.\n\nAs companies recruit new staff ahead of the peak winter months, some workers are calling for an investigation into the closely knit industry worth tens of millions of dollars.\n\nAmong them is Keelan Priscott, who said six months in his one-time \"dream job\" had left \"a sour taste\".\n\nKeelan Priscott holds a master's degree in marine biology and was eager to work on the world's largest fringing reef. (Supplied)\n\n\"I was one of two applicants selected out of 160 applicants for diving,\" the 27-year-old said.\n\n\"After leaving the UK three years ago, I could have never imagined that I would have landed a role up in the Ningaloo.\"\n\nThe remote WA town of Exmouth, about 1,230 kilometres north of Perth, attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year as the chief gateway to the World Heritage-listed Ningaloo Reef.\n\nThe tourist town of Exmouth in WA's north-west. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)\n\nIts kaleidoscopic corals and marine animals are fixtures of state and federal advertising campaigns, contributing $110 million to the state's economy annually, according to Tourism WA.\n\nBut Mr Priscott said he was paid \"far below the minimum wage\" and missed out on about $4,000, plus superannuation, during his time as a dive instructor.\n\n\"It's really a cash cow,\" he said.\n\nHis former employer, Dive Ningaloo, denies the allegations of underpayment.\n\nIn a letter to the ABC, the company said it was not aware of any wrongdoing, and was \"extremely disappointed that [Mr Priscott] did not raise the matter\" before leaving Exmouth.\n\nLegal questions\n\nCentral to Mr Priscott's claims is the legal distinction between independent contractors and employees.\n\nIndependent contractors often negotiate their own fees and arrangements, such as working for multiple clients.\n\nThey do not have the same rights as employees and forego casual loading, overtime, superannuation and worker's compensation.\n\nKeelan Priscott took his pay dispute to the Fair Work Ombudsman, but says progress has stalled. (Supplied)\n\nSince August 2024, the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) has set out a \"whole of relationship test\" to help employers determine whether a worker is a contractor or an employee.\n\nMr Priscott claims he was wrongly treated by Dive Ningaloo as a contractor, when he was legally entitled to the benefits of a casual employee.\n\nHow did we investigate these allegations? Reviewed Keelan Priscott's first contract, payslips and invoices.\n\nObtained text messages between Mr Priscott and Dive Ningaloo management.\n\nSpoke with multiple sources about work practices in Exmouth's marine tourism industry.\n\nHis first contract, signed in January 2025 and seen by the ABC, showed he was being paid a flat rate of $220 for an 8-hour day on Ningaloo Reef.\n\nA rate of $240 was paid for a 9-to-10 hour day at the Murion Islands.\n\nUnder the professional diving industry (recreational) award for casual employees in FY2025, he would have received a minimum rate of $32.49 an hour, or $259.92 for an eight-hour day.\n\nDuring FY2026, that figure rose to $33.71 an hour.\n\nCompany rejects claims\n\nMr Priscott has lodged a complaint with the ombudsman in a bid to recoup the thousands of dollars he believes he was underpaid during six months of work.\n\nThe regulator declined to comment.\n\nUltimately, the question of whether Mr Priscott is entitled to the claimed payment will hinge on whether he should have been classified as an employee \u2013 rather than a contractor \u2013 from the time he began working for them.\n\nThe Fair Work Ombudsman declined to comment on the matter. (ABC News: Billy Cooper)\n\nIn response to questions by the ABC, Dive Ningaloo said its instructors often began as contractors and were converted to casual employee status within three months.\n\nBy July 2025, Mr Priscott too was onboarded as a casual employee and his superannuation paid from then on.\n\nThe company said it initially engaged staff as contractors, so staff could claim tax benefits they would otherwise not qualify for.\n\nWorkers typically relocated to Exmouth, provided much of their own dive equipment, and paid their PADI dive certification and insurance: all of which the company said they could claim as tax deductions.\n\n\"If [Dive Ningaloo starts] people on as a casual and they are not suitable for the job and are dismissed within a week or so, then they have wasted a lot of money relocating,\" the company said.\n\n\" This is done to benefit the worker. \"\n\nBut Mr Priscott said little changed after he was made a casual employee.\n\nWhile he did receive superannuation payments from this time, he was still required to invoice the company to be paid.\n\nHis wage remained a flat rate per day that was below the minimum award payment he was entitled to as an employee.\n\nHe said he did not feel comfortable raising these concerns with Dive Ningaloo because the owner was his landlord in a cash-only rental agreement \u2013 something the company acknowledged as \"subsidised\" housing.\n\nKeelan Priscott says he did not raise the issue because he feared losing his housing. (Supplied/Canva)\n\nFormer dean of The University of Sydney Law School Joellen Riley Munton said an examination of whose business was being served was \"fundamental\" when distinguishing an employee from a contractor.\n\n\"Are they [the worker] running their own business or are they working in the business and for the business of a hirer?\" she said.\n\nJoellen Riley Munton is one of Australia's leading experts in employment law. (ABC News: Adam Griffiths)\n\nDr Riley Munton said, in her opinion, Mr Priscott's contract bore several hallmarks of the latter, despite the fact it referred to him as a contractor.\n\nThe document asked he be available at fixed start and finish times, purchase and wear a Dive Ningaloo uniform, and not take work at other companies.\n\n\"One judge in our system many years ago said you can't decide to call a rooster a duck and thereby turn it into a duck,\" Dr Riley Munton said.\n\n\"If it's a rooster, it's a rooster, no matter what label you give it.\n\n\"It seems that a lot of people who are employing people in these areas, are small businesses themselves, and they're not well advised.\"\n\nThe Ningaloo Reef attracts tens of thousands of tourists each year. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)\n\nDive Ningaloo said it was willing to discuss the claim with Mr Priscott and had contacted the FWO to initiate a pay dispute resolution, which has not progressed.\n\n\"It's been an emotional toll because you feel that the work you're doing is amazing, but the reward you're getting doesn't reflect that,\" Mr Priscott said.\n\n\"It's like the wild, wild west.\"\n\nStaff allege they were underpaid, overworked\n\nOther workers in Exmouth have come forward with allegations of underpayment at multiple companies, including some of those behind its famous whale shark experiences.\n\nAt least five people told the ABC they had enquired with the FWO about different whale shark tour operators, but no further action had materialised.\n\nOnly 15 commercial operators are granted licences by the WA government to take tourists swimming with the docile megafauna.\n\nTours can cost more than $600 per person in some cases.\n\nThe remote town of Exmouth contributes more than $100 million to the WA economy. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)\n\nOne whale shark guide and photographer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said she worked 10 to 12 hours a day for $250, despite being a casual employee.\n\n\"We were never offered any extra compensation for longer days or even public holidays or weekends,\" she said.\n\nShe also described a heavy physical toll.\n\n\"You get a very mixed type of clientele \u2026 who may have never snorkelled before, aren't confident in the water, and you're often doing it in very open ocean, in very rough conditions,\" she said.\n\n\" More than once, I've pretty much saved people's lives. \"\n\nOne former whale shark guide says she had to save lives on the job, but struggled with underpayment. (Supplied)\n\nShe said she was asked to supply and insure her own camera equipment at a cost exceeding $20,000.\n\nEditing clients' photos often saw her work late for no additional pay.\n\n\"For a lot of us that work in the industry up here, we're willing to just shoulder that lack of rights, because we do love our jobs,\" she said.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, when you look back on how much money you\u2019re making, how much stress you're under, how long your days [are], it's just not sustainable, it's not affordable.\n\n\" And, at some point, you definitely do feel like you've been taken advantage of. \"\n\n'Systemic' problems\n\nFilmmaker Nate Porter said he was shocked by the \"systemic\" issues impacting marine tourism workers when he first arrived in Exmouth.\n\nNate Porter says he was shocked by the treatment of workers. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)\n\n\"Everybody up here feels very replaceable,\" he said.\n\n\"Can\u2019t speak out, can\u2019t speak your mind \u2026 [or] you're replaced next week.\"\n\nThe problem compounds an extremely high cost of living in the community.\n\n\"These whale sharkers that are up here are not living the glamorous life,\" Mr Porter said.\n\n\"I've seen where you've got honestly, like 10 to 12 whale shark employees living in the same house \u2026 I've heard people paying as much as $400 a week in rent to live in a trailer in front of the house.\"\n\nJoel O'Brien says some workers reported being underpaid as much as $10 an hour. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)\n\nHe took the issue to the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA), which has begun its own investigation into several operators.\n\nMUA north west organiser Joel O'Brien said he had contacted Dive Ningaloo late last year to request a copy of Mr Priscott's employment records under a provision of the Fair Work Act.\n\nThe company did not respond within the allotted 14-day period, calling the union's correspondence \"threatening and belligerent\".\n\nMr O'Brien said more workers had approached the union, with some paid as much as $10 an hour less than they were entitled to under the marine tourism award\n\n\"A lot of these people are foreign workers, migrant workers on visas, so they're really open to exploitation,\" he said.\n\nKnow more? Email Alistair Bates on bates.alistair@abc.net.au or securely on alistairbates@proton.me\n\nHaving recently relocated to New Zealand, Mr Priscott said his correspondence with the FWO was cut short because the regulator would not contact him overseas.\n\nHe plans to return to Australia to pursue the matter.\n\n\"The owners just want to reap as much reward from it as possible,\" he said.",

        "text": "An ACT Supreme Court judge quoted Roman philosopher Cicero and the movie The Castle as she ruled in favour of three Canberra public housing tenants who claimed plans to move them breached their human rights.\n\nThe three women filed a civil claim after being targeted by a new public housing policy.\n\nThe program, called the ACT Growing and Renewing Public Housing Program, had the objective of creating more public housing in the territory, either by using the money from the sale of existing properties or by redevelopment of those sites.\n\nUltimately, the women were not forced to move.\n\n'Interference with one's home must be lawful'\n\nBut Justice Verity McWilliam found that during the process, they were denied procedural fairness, and their human rights were breached.\n\nIn delivering her verdict Justice Verity McWilliam quoted Michael Caton as Darryl Kerrigan (left) from the 1997 Australian film The Castle. (Roadshow Entertainment)\n\n\"It need hardly be said that any interference with one's home must be lawful. That pithy one-liner in The Castle (1997), voiced in the fictional character of Darryl Kerrigan, still resonates:\n\n\"It's not a house, it's a home. A man's home is his castle \u2026 You can't just walk in and steal our homes,\" Justice McWilliam said, quoting the movie.\n\nThe judge did note the reference was to a section of the constitution, rather than ACT law, but said: \"Expressions of a person's connection to their home stem back to at least Roman times, when Cicero wrote, 'What more sacred, what more strongly guarded by every holy feeling, than a man's own home?'\"\n\nThe notices to move came in 2020 and 2022.\n\nCommissioner concedes procedural fairness denied\n\nResolving the case was made easier when the ACT Social Housing Commissioner conceded there had been a denial of procedural fairness in the initial decisions to include the dwellings in the program.\n\nJustice McWilliam noted there was no consultation at the time.\n\n\"The policy suggests that such consideration of the potential impact in that regard was to occur at a later stage in the process of required relocation,\" Justice McWilliam said.\n\nAs an example she cited a letter sent to the son of the first complainant:\n\nDear [son of first complainant] , Please see below decision points: The redevelopment yield for this property will be 3x 2-bedroom properties, There is a low percentage of stock in that suburb, The plans for DA have been lodged and are awaiting approvals. Thanks for your time, [signed]\n\n\"There was manifestly no consideration of the first plaintiff's right to freedom from unlawful or arbitrary interference with her home,\" Justice McWilliam said.\n\n\" There was no consideration of the plaintiff's particular circumstances at all. \"\n\nBut even though the Commissioner for Social Housing did concede there was no procedural fairness, it did fight the breach of human rights claim.\n\nUnder the ACT's Human Rights Act public authorities must act in a way compatible with human rights.\n\nThe women didn't win on all counts, but did secure a finding their human rights were breached by the actions.\n\nThe court has now ordered their costs be paid by the commissioner.\n\nAnd all are safely in their homes.\n\n'Tense years taken their toll'\n\nOne of the women affected, Yvette Van Loo, said the judgment had been a great relief.\n\n\"The tense last five years since ACT Housing have tried to remove me have taken their toll in my life and on my health,\" Ms Van Loo said.\n\n\"But what I really want to add is that this situation should never have been allowed to arise.

Got it Share A A A\n\nE-bikeshare company Lime is chasing repeat customers with cheaper trips, in some cases five times less than standard rates, as it tries to turn public transport-reliant commuters into members and grow ahead of its expected stock market launch in the US. While its strategy is company-wide, with subscriptions first introduced in 2021, the Uber-backed firm has ramped up its latest member drive in Sydney where, towards the end of last year, it tweaked its LimePrime plan cost and per minute rates to nudge more customers into signing up. In cities like Melbourne, traditional rates for Lime still apply, with casual fees charged at $1 to unlock its electric-assisted vehicles and up to 60 cents per minute of rental, with a 20-minute trip costing roughly $13. Rates differ by vehicle type. Head of Lime Australia, William Peters, riding one of their many bikes. Nick Moir Under its new LimePrime offering in Sydney, members who pay $4.99 per month do not have to pay any fees to unlock bikes, with flat fares of $1.50 for trips under five minutes and $2.75 for rides up to 20 minutes. Trips over 20 minutes will be charged at a discounted rate of 29 cents per minute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new Sydney-only LimePrime product offers substantially improved savings compared with the old plans still available in other cities where subscription is $5.99 per month and there are no discounted riding rates. The company has also begun introducing its newest generation of e-bikes in Sydney, which it says make for a smoother ride and more secure helmet locking. While Sydney is the first Australian market with the improved LimePrime plan and bikes, the company has hit regulatory barriers to offering its e-scooters \u2013 which are popular in other cities such as Melbourne \u2013 with authorities in central Sydney yet to authorise their use. Lime first launched in Australia in 2018, and has faced intense competition both here and globally. While key competitors Beam and Neuron merged in September, players such as oBike, Mobike, Ofo, ReddyGo and Airbike have popped up before abruptly vanishing from Australian streets. The legacy of failed operators, however, lives on, said Dr Elliot Fishman, the director of the Melbourne-based Institute for Sensible Transport who completed a PhD comparing bike share schemes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt has become harder for new businesses to come in because of councils who need to grant them approvals, and basically, anyone will remember seeing the bikes thrown in rivers, the bikes scattered on footpaths and in parks.\u201d Related Article E-Scooters Six hospitalised during seven hours of e-scooter carnage overnight \u201cThe bike share sector has been so crowded, there\u2019s a sense that for some it\u2019s only a matter of time before they go out of business, and it\u2019s a real liability for cities and governments when they have to deal with stranded or locked up bikes and a bankrupt company can\u2019t clean up their own mess,\u201d he said. Optimistic investors rushed to back various startups early on, but Fishman said the focus for operators now was consolidation and differentiation \u2013 whether by product or price \u2013 to demonstrate how they can survive. Lime cutting prices for regular users could be one such tactic, Fishman said. \u201cThe industry can get dangerous because there\u2019s this winner takes all mentality.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLime\u2019s integration with the Uber app and global presence has also contributed to its broader accessibility. A Lime spokesperson did not respond to questions about whether it was losing money from the significantly cheaper rental rates being offered in Sydney, or whether its push for members was related to its planned stock market launch. Related Article NSW State Parliament \u2018It\u2019s just insane\u2019: Doctors, lawyers back green slips for e-bikes However, a source with knowledge of the company\u2019s business model said that the cheaper rates could still be profitable if it converted enough users into members. \u201cYou want people to say \u2018why don\u2019t I just use these bikes all the time\u2019,\u201d they said. \u201cYou absolutely can make money on these rates. Yes, the paying as you go rates are far more profitable, but because if you\u2019re a member you\u2019re doing more trips, if they do enough it can definitely be viable [for Lime].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe source said that Lime viewed Sydney as a good test city for new bike technology and discount offers because of its improving bike infrastructure and strong customer demand, before rolling changes out to other markets in Australia and around the world. \u201cI think the company\u2019s primary goal is getting people moving from thinking about Lime as a \u2018sometimes\u2019 product to one they use every day,\u201d the source said. Fishman said low-cost high-use schemes effective in cities such as London and Paris, where average uses per bike can exceed 10 per day.

Got it Share A A A\n\nCABARET\n\nAmplified\n\nBelvoir St Theatre, January 30\n\nUntil February 8\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Long after Chrissy Amphlett\u2019s band Divinyls ground to a halt, she imagined doing a one-woman theatrical show about herself and her songs. Having spent her Divinyls career playing a fiery, racy, pouting, unpredictable schoolgirl, she wanted a character this time, too, reportedly settling on a crow. It was never to be. She died of breast cancer before the half-formed dream took flight. Enter Sheridan Harbridge, Glenn Moorhouse and Sarah Goodes. Together, they envisaged a ghost of the show Amphlett had contemplated, subtitling it The Exquisite Rock and Rage of Chrissy Amphlett. Harbridge wrote it, with Moorhouse as musical director and Goodes directing Harbridge\u2019s performance. They\u2019ve done a storming job. Sheridan Harbridge as Chrissy Amphlett in a potent performance. Jade Ellis Harbridge doesn\u2019t become Chrissy, in the sense that the story is told in the third person, but Amphlett\u2019s spirit is alive and living dangerously inside Harbridge\u2019s performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat a range the latter has, from being the best Blanche I\u2019ve seen in A Streetcar Named Desire, to now exploding off the stage with a singing voice I didn\u2019t know she had, that could be brutally powerful when required, yet also sweetly soulful. Harbridge\u2019s voice can be brutally powerful but also sweetly soulful. Jade Ellis Beyond the potency of her performance and the engaging storytelling, the music and spoken word are interwoven so that a Divinyls hit might start, shudder to a stop while Harbridge tells us more, pick up again, and repeat this process. It\u2019s done so well that you\u2019re not cursing the fact that they won\u2019t get on with the song; you\u2019re engrossed in an ever-growing tension that finally finds release when the song takes centre-stage. Sheridan Harbridge in full flight. Jade Ellis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother strength is the music itself, with Moorhouse (on guitar) joined by Clarabell Limonta (keyboard), Ben Cripps (bass) and Dave Hatch (drums). I never particularly rated Divinyls as a band, compared with their songs and Amphlett\u2019s performance of them. Moorhouse and company have knocked some bricks out of the wall of sound and replaced them with nuance, without losing the kick to the surging chorus of, say, Boys in Town. Related Article What\u2019s on Chrissy Amphlett wrote a show in which she was a crow. Years after her death, her vision lives on The fearless Harbridge, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t just enter the audience, she invades it. She\u2019s also funny, and the humour makes for a completeness of emotional impact, given the inherent sadness of a story of excess, of Amphlett\u2019s repeatedly having to smash the same glass ceiling, and then suffering multiple sclerosis before the cancer hit. Perhaps it\u2019s also so moving because the show exudes such immense affection for its subject. If the intensity of grip is released a little in the final phase, it\u2019s certainly reasserted when they launch into I Touch Myself, the song that made the teenage Harbridge a fan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI suspect Amphlett would approve. She\u2019d have appreciated the absence of hagiography and sugar-coating, and she may have recognised a fellow traveller in the high-stakes game of being audacious on stage. She may have even stood up with the rest of us at the end. MUSIC\n\nThe Whitlams and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra\n\nState Theatre, January 31\n\nReviewed by SHAMIM RAZAVI\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd The Whitlams were early adopters of the now-fashionable \u201c\u2026 and symphony\u201d trend, returning to it intermittently over the past 20 years. It is a format that frontman Tim Freedman freely admits can be reduced to \u201csome strings on top of our chords\u201d \u2013 a reduction he spends the evening trying to disprove. His counterargument opens convincingly with Beauty in Me with the two elements in balance: the orchestra afforded the space to carry the opening lines on their own, with Freedman on piano and daughter Alice on vocals, joining in as the song unfolds. This sets up the template for the night: agreeable, well-balanced and designed to amplify the band\u2019s hallmark pretty tunes. Tim Freedman. Sitthixay Ditthavong\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe effect is more interesting when inverted, the swelling strings pulling counter to the sardonic lyrics of Fondness Makes the Heart Grow Absent, heightening the slight-of-hand tricksy of the original. The same effect is even more powerful on Melbourne, the tale of righteous outsider contrarianism that gains bite when delivered with the buttoned-up formality of the symphony. Twenty years of orchestral toying has thrown up the occasional gem, chief among them Out the Back, co-written with distinguished composer Peter Sculthorpe. No mere rearrangement for strings, this is a genuine three-way conversation between guitarist Jak Housden\u2019s languid line, Freedman\u2019s lazy lyrics and the orchestra\u2019s expansive response. On record, it is clever and tight \u2013 live, it takes beautiful flight. The Whitlams were an early adopter of the symphony concert and use the format well. Sitthixay Ditthavong The arrangement of Up Against the Wall by the masterful Benjamin Northey similarly transcends the strings-atop-chords formula: a meaningful reworking rather than just pretty ornamentation. In both pieces, the orchestral accompaniment doesn\u2019t merely add depth but illumination, drawing out the Irish folk-inflected lines that underpin so much of the Whitlams\u2019 songwriting. All of which is to say that too much of the remainder amounted to an amiable but unrevealing run through the band\u2019s back catalogue. Sure, their hits are still fabulous and Blow Up The Pokies sounds even better with 30 more musicians whirling away. For all we are given, we are left wanting: more reimagining, less reupholstering.

Over the past 12 months the precious metal has been one of the biggest movers in the commodity market, with its value more than doubling and increasing at a rate faster than gold. Silver has recently outpaced gold as the in terms of the highest increase in value over the past 12 months. Bloomberg While silver is commonly associated with jewellery due to its malleability and shine, the metal is also known as a good conductor of electricity. Almost all electrical appliances use silver contacts and switches. Microwaves, dishwashers, TVs, telephones, toys and computers all contain silver. However, more recently the metal is used in solar cells where it helps to conduct sunlight into electricity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerth Mint Institutions and Business Solutions General Manager John O\u2019Donoghue said silver had seen a significant rally over the past 12 months, supported by growing investor demand and strong industrial consumption. \u201cFrom a price perspective, silver finished December 2024 at $46.50 (AUD) an ounce and 12 months on, in December 2025, it fetched more than $100 an ounce and is currently priced around $168 an ounce,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an extraordinary time for the precious metals market with gold and silver prices setting new records almost daily. \u201cGold was up more than 50 per cent in Australian dollar terms in the year to 31 December 2025, and silver rose more than 130 per cent for the year. That momentum has continued into 2026.\u201d O\u2019Donoghue said the higher price for silver has been driven by many of the same factors influencing recent rise in the gold price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat is, global economic uncertainty and geopolitical instability which continues to support safe-haven buying. \u201cCoupled with this is strong industrial demand for silver given its use in electric vehicles, photovoltaics and other technologies. \u201cWe are also seeing elements of momentum\u2011based or \u2018FOMO\u2019 trading in the market. \u201cWhen prices rise quickly, some investors feel compelled to enter the market to avoid missing out on further gains, and that additional demand can amplify the upward movement.\u201d One kilogram silver bars stacked at the Perth Mint Refinery. Bloomberg\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Western Australia, silver is way down on the list of major mining exports, outweighed by the traditional resources including iron ore, copper, natural gas and gold. According to the most recent available data from the Department of Mining, Petroleum and Exploration, quarterly production of silver peaked in terms of value in the three months ending in December of 2021, when the metal brought the state $46.43 million from 46.32 tonnes. That compares to the December quarter last year when just 27.89 tonnes of silver brought in $45.35 million to the state. WA School of Mines Chair of Extractive Metallurgy Professor Jacques Eksteen said while silver often holds a stronger value than other metals, it is predominantly mined as a by-product. \u201cSilver is normally a by-product of base metal mining and sometimes gold mines,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is seldom the dominant metal (in quantity) of a given mine, although it may lead in value.\u201d Eksteen added that WA is not widely known for large silver deposits and the precious metal is more commonly found in Queensland. \u201cThe most important silver mine in Australia is the Cannington silver-lead-zinc mine in Queensland and is owned by South32,\u201d he said. \u201cSilver recovery is non-trivial due to a complex chemistry and reagent requirement to maintain it stable in solution. \u201cIt has a wide diversity in forms of mineralisation, but where it is associated with lead and zinc. It can be fairly easily recovered as a sulfide concentrate using flotation which then is processed further at a refinery using predominantly high-temperature processes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the majority of silver mined in WA comes as a by-product from other base metal operations, Dr ALex Walker, a research fellow at John de Laeter Centre in Curtin University, said there were two sites in the state that were exploring the extraction of silver as a primary ore. \u201cElizabeth Hill operated until 2000 when the silver price dropped below US$5 per ounce,\u201d he said. \u201cHosting bonanza-grade silver, gravity separation was used to concentrate the native silver. \u201cIt and the surrounding tenement space is now occupied by West Coast Silver which is busy establishing the extent of mineralisation beyond the historic workings. The company is collaborating with Curtin to characterise the silver mineralisation.\u201d According to West Coast Silver, the Elizabeth Hill operation, based in the Pilbara, has a proven history of silver production. Between 1998 and 2000, the mine produced 1.2 million ounces of silver from just 16,830 tonnes of ore, achieving a head grade of 2194 grams per tonne.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Gold The surging commodity that now accounts for a quarter of WA\u2019s mining workforce The other major silver producer is the Abra silver-lead mine, about 200km north-west of Meekatharra, which Walker said was also working with Curtin University. \u201cThe Abra silver-lead mine, now owned and operated by Endurance Mining, has historically been heavy on lead extraction,\u201d he said. \u201cEndurance is leaning into exploring silver deportment in the deposit in collaboration with Curtin University.\u201d O\u2019Donoghue said the rise in the value of silver had seen customers take the opportunity to cash out of their silver holdings and realise gains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cElevated prices typically encourage investors to rebalance their holdings, and that\u2019s evident from the activity we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Perth Mint purchases silver bullion from customers. Unlike gold, we don\u2019t purchase silver jewellery.\u201d O\u2019Donoghue said the enormous demand for precious metals, and in particular silver bullion products, has resulted in unprecedented logistical and production challenges for the Mint to meet the volume of orders it is receiving, meaning it has had to limit the availability of some silver products. \u201cWe know this is disappointing for our customers. We\u2019re working hard to meet the surge while maintaining the highest standards for precision and quality,\u201d he said. \u201cOur inspection, packing and dispatching processes are highly manual. Every coin, bar and numismatic product is individually inspected, and items require careful handling as they are placed into sleeves, tubes or boxes. \u201cWe\u2019re increasing staffing to speed up these processes and thank customers for their patience.\u201d\n\nSave You have reached your maximum number of saved items.

In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission made late Friday, SpaceX said it\u2019s creating the solar-powered network in order to \u201caccommodate the explosive growth of data demands driven by AI.\u201d SpaceX proposes that the sun - shown here in an image from the Solar Dynamics Observatory during a geomagnetic storm watch last year - would directly power the AI data centres in space. NASA/AP \u201cLaunching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centres is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilisation \u2014 one that can harness the sun\u2019s full power \u2014 while supporting AI-driven applications for billions of people today and ensuring humanity\u2019s multi-planetary future amongst the stars,\u201d SpaceX wrote in the filing. The system, which could be launched via the company\u2019s reusable Starship rocket, would serve as a lower-cost and more environmentally friendly alternative to land-based data centres, the filing states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Opinion\n\nTrump's America Trump is driving America into a new dark age Instead of requiring cooling systems that use large volumes of water like those on land, the network would rely on radiative cooling that occurs in space, which allows for the dissipation of heat. It would also reduce the need to rely on batteries, since it would acquire energy from the sun, according to the filing. Musk responded to reports of the filing on X early Saturday morning, stating \u201cI thought we\u2019d start small and work our way up\u201d. The satellites, which will use laser links to communicate with each other, will be launched between an altitude of 500 km (310.69 miles) and 2,000 km in an orbit that would provide them near constant access to the sun, according to the filing. SpaceX founder Elon Musk says the lowest cost place to put AI will be space, and \u201cthat\u2019ll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest\u201d.

SpaceX is also considering an alternative combination with Tesla Inc. Musk has publicly spoken about the need for orbital data centres and his companies\u2019 ambitions to pioneer the technology, most recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer for building AI data centres in space,\u201d Musk said at the forum. \u201cThe lowest cost place to put AI will be space, and that\u2019ll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest.\u201d Bloomberg The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nToday, human beings spend a great deal of time in front of their televisions.\n\nAustralians spend between two and a half and three hours watching broadcast and on-delay TV every day.\n\nIf you add in streaming services, some studies suggest that figure could be as high as six hours a day.\n\nWhich is quite an impact when you consider that it's only a hundred years since TV was invented.\n\nThe name John Logie Baird is synonymous with the history of television.\n\nHe was a businessman, but above all an inventor and he gave the first public demonstration of what would become known as television in January 1926 at his Soho Laboratory in Frith Street in London.\n\nUnlike the electronic systems that would follow, Baird's Televisor was mechanical.\n\nLewis Pollard is the Curator of Television and Broadcast, Science and Media Museum in the United Kingdom.\n\nHe says it was a breakthrough but extremely difficult to operate.\n\n\"It was very technical, very complicated and because Baird was such a pioneer in what he was doing, he had to be essentially making a lot of his equipment from scratch or using whatever you might have had around the lab. So the apparatus we have on site in the museum has parts of an old hatbox, a bicycle lamp, and it was very DIY because you couldn't just go to a shop and buy the pieces you needed because television didn't exist.\"\n\nThe BBC launched the world\u2019s first regularly scheduled TV service in 1936 in the UK, but as this newsreel footage suggests, it was viewed as a bit of a novelty, and a distraction from the serious work of radio.\n\n\"The BBC's first regular television broadcasts began on the 2nd November 1936, introduced by Leslie Mitchell. There was no colour of course, pictures were strictly black and white or, as some cynics suggested, black and dark grey. But definition improved with usage. Transmission was limited to two hours a day.\"\n\nIn 1938 Logie Baird spoke to British Movietone newsreel audiences in Australia and New Zealand, where television did not start until 1956, nearly two decades later.\n\n\"It is now 12 years ago since I produced the first little flickering television image. Today we have in London a regular television service twice daily with thousands of lookers-in (viewers). Television has grown from a scientific novelty to a commercial service. At present the range is limited to 30 miles in and about London. In this connection it is interesting to note that as far back as 1928 I spanned the Atlantic with television. That was of course purely experimental but who can foretell the future.\"\n\nCertainly there had been huge improvements since those early days.\n\nLogie Baird had to use a ventriloquist's dummy as a subject for that first broadcast as the lighting employed was so intense, anything being lit had a tendency to catch fire.\n\nBy 1953, the technology had improved so much that the BBC felt confident enough to launch its biggest outside broadcast to date - the coronation of Queen Elizabeth the second, with their program being recorded on film as it was broadcast, and sent around the world.\n\nLewis Pollard again.\n\n\"Any TV camera in the UK that could be mobilised was mobilised for use during the coronation. It was such a large media event that's why so many people remember it. We talk, here the museum about, the millions of people who watched, but one thing that people might not be so familiar with is the televisions in the 1950s were larger than Baird's Televisor, but still very small and the records say something like 17 people watched each television set, which would be half the size of a contemporary TV, maybe even smaller than that. So, for people watching at home, you know, it was such a big moment that it really helped, I'd say it really helped cement television as part of people's everyday lives. It went from this novelty that some people might have to, oh, I should have this in my home as well. And that's what really made television go as big as it did in the UK.\"\n\nThe next revolution came with the ability to record television programs in high quality for later broadcast.\n\nThe first broadcast quality video recorder was the Ampex VRX-1000, a gigantic machine which American broadcaster CBS first used in earnest in 1956.\n\nIt was the size of a piano, and cost $50,000 US - the equivalent of 900,000 Australian dollars today.\n\nLogie Baird had already foreseen the importance of being able to record video, and had come up with his own system many years earlier.\n\n\"He was also really, experimenting with the idea of being able to record television signals, because in those days, all television as it went out was live. There was no way of recording such vast amounts of data in any way, shape or form. And Baird was working with a system he called Phonovision, which was recording both the image and sound components of a television broadcast onto essentially like a vinyl disc and the really interesting story behind that is we have some of those discs in our collection, and they weren't essentially translated until much, much later, until after Baird had passed away, because he had a way of encoding the information onto a disc. We had no way of decoding it. So as far as he was aware, that system may or may not have worked. And it was until much later that we proved that actually, yes, it did work.\"\n\nFrom a flickering black-and-white novelty to cinema-quality colour in the palm of our hand, visual media has come a very long way in a hundred years.",

We don't want to be left as a second thought or an inconvenience in this ever-changing world. We want to be there in the forefront with you standing by you, not standing behind you.\u201d\n\nUncle John Baxter was deeply involved in the exhibition's creation from the planning stage.\n\nHis installation 'Not Fit For Purpose' also telling an important story.\n\n\u201cSometimes when we receive this equipment, they're not fit for purpose. We think that they may be, or somebody else has thought on our behalf that, oh yes, uncle needs a wheelchair, so we'll give them a wheelchair. They may not realize that Uncle lives in a remote community. There are no footpaths. There are no sealed roads. You're going down dirt tracks. Uncle wants to be a part of his culture.\u201d\n\nAccessibility is woven into the exhibition's design, including elements such as tactile panels, audio descriptions, Auslan interpretation and large print materials.\n\nThis is Trevor Ahearn, the major projects lead in the First Nations department at the Australian Museum.\n\n\u201cWe also wanted to create a design language that sort of made access prominent, a prominent theme, not just for people with access needs, but for people who able bodied people, people who don't have access needs to come in and be aware of what it takes to make a thing accessible.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, about one quarter of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people report having a disability.\n\nThis exhibition also highlighting the intersection of ableism and racism.\n\nThis is Gayle Kennedy, a Wongaiibon Clan member.\n\n\u201cIf you really want to know us, look at our eyes, see the power in them, see the strength. And not only as Aboriginal people, but as people with disabilities, because as far as I'm concerned, we are the most marginalized people in any society worldwide.\u201d\n\nA vessel for truth telling - each of the 30 participants told their story on their own terms.\n\n\u201cI think that you could see that in all of these photographs.

        "text": "Kazuyo Kitada used to work seven days a week \u2014 9am to midnight on weekdays, and 9am to 5pm on weekends.\n\nOn one occasion, a client called the office at 2am. The following day, Kitada\u2019s employer asked her why she wasn't there.\n\n\"I need sleep,\" she recalls thinking.\n\nIt was the 1990s, and Kitada was working in Japan for an IT company where she would ultimately spend two decades. At the time, she was putting in long hours on a tough project for a difficult customer, she tells SBS News.\n\nSince moving to Australia 16 years ago, she's observed a workforce culture that she says focuses much more on the individual than the company.\n\n\"If someone is ill, of course, that project would be delayed,\" she says, contrasting the relative flexibility in Australian workplaces with the unmoving project deadlines she previously experienced.\n\n\"Twenty years ago, in Japan, if something happened on the first day of a family trip, you have to [go] back to the company, right?\n\nIt's company: number one. Working: number one.\n\nThose expectations weren't unusual in Japan, which has long struggled with a notoriously punishing work culture marked by long hours and untenable workloads, driving a host of work-related health problems.\n\nDeath by overwork became so familiar in Japan that it has a name: karoshi.\n\nBut like many countries, Japan has seen a significant shift in attitudes towards work over the past decade, particularly among younger people and notably since the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe issue was thrust back into the spotlight in October with the appointment of a new prime minister, whose personal attitude to work has fuelled controversy at home and abroad.\n\nA leader who will 'work, work, work, work, work'\n\nWhile the extreme work culture of decades past has been on its way out for some time, overwork remains a major social flashpoint.\n\nThat's why it sparked such debate when Japan's new leader, conservative Sanae Takaichi, made a personal commitment to abandon work-life balance, vowing to \"work, work, work, work, work\" and encouraging her party's members to do the same.\n\nShe made international headlines again in November last year, when she called a 3am meeting with aides, claiming she sleeps as little as two to four hours a night.\n\nIt stirred concerns that she is modelling a work ethic that many Japanese people are striving to move away from.\n\nJapan's National Defense Counsel for Victims of Karoshi said her comments \"could force workers, including government employees, to overwork and work long hours and could revive an outdated mentality\".\n\nIt also drew backlash from labour unions and some members of parliament.\n\nYoshihiko Noda, a former prime minister and leader of the main opposition party, called the 3am meeting \"crazy\" in an interview with the New York Times.\n\n\"It\u2019s a very sad attitude for the top leader of the country to show,\" he said.\n\nTakaichi's \"work, work, work\" remark earned the title of Japan's 2025 buzzword of the year, awarded by publishing house Jiy\u016b Kokumin Sha, and sparked further backlash from the families of karoshi victims.\n\nSanae Takaichi, leader of the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, was elected prime minister by Japan\u2019s parliament last October. Source: Getty / Rodrigo Reyes Marin/Pool/Anadolu\n\nAt the award ceremony, Takaichi emphasised that she did not intend to suggest that long working hours are a virtue, nor to encourage them among the public.\n\nStill, Hiroshi Ono, a professor of human resources at Tokyo's Hitotsubashi University, tells SBS News the prime minister's original messaging sent the \"wrong signal\".\n\n\"That's exactly what we're not supposed to do,\" he says.\n\n\"If that was not Takaichi [and] that was a private company, they'd be blacklisted.\n\nCalling a meeting at three in the morning \u2014 no, you can't do that.\n\nIn Japan, \"black companies\" refer to employers known for exploitative labour practices and excessive working hours. Since 2017, the government has published lists of companies that violate employment laws.\n\nTakaichi is also looking to relax Japan's overtime restrictions, currently capped at 45 hours a month, as employers contend with significant labour shortages and a shrinking working-age population.\n\nThat overtime cap was introduced as part of work-style reforms passed in 2019, which were intended to \"correct this work culture of excessive work hours, karoshi\", Ono says.\n\nTakaichi's approval rating sky high\n\nDespite her controversial remarks about work, Takaichi has received exceptionally high approval ratings \u2014 north of 70 per cent in some polls \u2014 with very strong support from younger voters.\n\nIn December, her approval stood at more than 92 per cent among voters aged 18 to 29 and 83 per cent among those aged 30 to 39, according to a joint poll by the Sankei Shimbun newspaper and Fuji News Network, a television network.\n\nA small survey of 100 Japanese working women aged 20 to 49 last year found that more than half took Takaichi's remarks about work positively, with many viewing it as a personal declaration of her resolve.\n\nAnother survey, conducted by the Shufu JOB Research Institute, found that respondents had \"high expectations\" for the new administration regarding the promotion of women's workforce participation.\n\nYounger generations, particularly those raising children, appeared to hold high hopes that the appointment of the first female prime minister would lead to improvements in working conditions.\n\nREAD MORE Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi dissolves parliament after three months in office\n\nRyoko Yoshida is a 38-year-old who works in Japan's automotive industry.\n\nShe tells SBS News that while Japan is growing out of the \"work, work, work\" mentality, she suspects Takaichi felt compelled to aggressively promote her own work ethic as the first woman in the role.\n\nBut Yoshida doesn't read the prime minister's rhetoric as a call for the working population to mirror it.\n\n\"It's still a society where women [are] quite looked down upon,\" she says.\n\n\"You can see how motivated she is as a PM. I think it worked for younger people.\"\n\nThis month, Takaichi, who took on the premier role after her predecessor resigned, called a snap election for 8 February. She told reporters she wanted \"the people to decide directly whether they can entrust the management of the country to me\".\n\nUnwinding a deeply-embedded culture\n\nIn the decades following World War Two, Japan's rapid economic rebuild entrenched a work-first culture that prioritised output, endurance and company loyalty.\n\n\"There was no upper bound to your work hours. And so literally, we had people that were working to death,\" Ono says.\n\nMore than five decades since the first documented case of karoshi, Japan records thousands of compensation claims for death and illness linked to excessive work each year, according to government data, including cases involving stroke, heart disease, mental health issues and suicide.\n\nRecognised cases of karoshi linked to heart or brain failure have declined over the past decade, according to data from Japan\u2019s health ministry, but a record number of people applied for mental health-related compensation in 2024.\n\nAlong with cost of living pressures, stagnant wages and entrenched gender roles, Japan's strenuous work culture is widely blamed for making it difficult for young people to raise families, exacerbating the country's perennially low birthrate.\n\nIn a bid to remedy that, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government introduced a flexible work system in April that gives employees the option to work four days a week while maintaining the same total working hours over a four-week period.\n\nGovernment figures show that working hours for full-time employees declined sharply in 2019, the year that work reforms were legislated, while uptake of paid leave started to rise.\n\n\"The work-style reform act of 2019 seems to have had some impact in improving the quality of life and quality of work in Japan,\" Ono says.\n\nFull-time employees in Japan receive a legal minimum of 10 to 20 days of annual leave, depending on length of service. The 2019 reforms stipulated that employers ensure workers take at least five days of paid leave a year.\n\nA generational shift\n\nOno, who is in his 50s, says his generation \"didn't ask questions\" and stuck to the status quo when it came to work.\n\n\"There is definitely a significant generational divide,\" he says. \"Younger people these days definitely value their personal time, and they're very much against this long-working-hour culture.\"\n\nSimilarly, Kitada, 57, who now works as a producer for SBS Japanese, says young people in Japan have the courage to \"speak up more than my era\".\n\nReflecting on how she used to work, she says it's \"really crazy\" to think about.\n\n\"But at that time, it's normal, because everybody worked the same way.\"\n\nYoshida, a millennial working in supply chain management, says her work hours are pretty flexible, and she's rarely expected to do overtime.\n\nShe believes younger generations are more broadly aware of their entitlements and prioritise work-life balance.\n\n\"I think younger people are not afraid to speak up to their bosses, and they don't mind being judged for [it],\" she says.\n\nThis is our boundary.\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with SBS Japanese, with additional reporting from Kate Onomichi.\n\nReaders seeking crisis support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14, the Suicide Call Back Service on 1300 659 467 and Kids Helpline on 1800 55 1800 (for young people aged up to 25).\n\nMore information and support with mental health is available at beyondblue.org.au and on 1300 22 4636.\n\nEmbrace Multicultural Mental Health supports people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "Around 600 feral camels in central Australia have been culled this week following an emergency meeting to overcome the animals wreaking 'havoc' in remote communities.\n\nA dry spell has led to large herds coming into Indigenous communities as they search for water, damaging mains and fences in their path.\n\nWorking as an area manager for MacDonnell Regional Council, Damien Ryan has experienced the issue firsthand.\n\n\"One morning last week, there was a leak off one of the buildings ... there were 80 camels clambering to get that little bit of water,\" he said.\n\n\"They just walk through six-foot-high security fences and they knock the taps off the outside walls ... they will break water mains a metre underground just to get to water.\"\n\nDamien Ryan says the camels are very destructive and a large cleanup will be required. Source: Facebook\n\nThis month, a dozen homes in the community of Mount Liebig \u2014 about 320km west of Alice Springs \u2014 were left without a water supply due to the damage, on days over 40C.\n\n\"There's a big cleanup operation,\" Ryan said.\n\nAs many as 800-1000 camels travelling in one direction \u2014 known as a 'camel train' \u2014 have been reported by residents, spanning 5km in length near Mount Liebig and Papunya.\n\nAccording to government assessments, this can happen in summer or during droughts, when herds congregate.\n\nWe're talking about large bull camels weighing hundreds of kilos that just want water and they're willing to do anything. NT Environment Minister Josh Burgoyne\n\nBurgoyne said the issue has caused \"absolute havoc\".\n\n\"Imagine waking up one morning and seeing hundreds of camels in your local community, and they can get quite aggressive\", he said.\n\nRyan said when water sources dry up, the camels \"smell water\" and find what they can.\n\n\"I've lived in central Australia all my life. They're some of the biggest camels I've ever seen,\" he said.\n\nThe Arabian camel, which is the only species found feral in Australia, weighs between 450 and 650kg. Source: Supplied / Damien Ryan\n\nA joint taskforce has been set up between the NT government, MacDonnell Regional Council and the Central Land Council (CLC), which approved a three-day aerial cull this week to assist.\n\nThe CLC says around 150 camels are being killed each day once they're moved from exclusion zones such as communities, outstations and roads.\n\nWhen rain returns, they disappear 'like fairy floss'\n\nCamels were first introduced to Australia in 1840, and by 2008, around one million of them were roaming the arid lands of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Queensland.\n\nAccording to a State of the Environment report by the federal government, the Australian Feral Camel Management Project between 2008 and 2013 removed more than 160,000 camels, at a cost of $19 million.\n\nThe project also supported the development of a commercial feral camel industry and contributed to a reduction of the feral population to around 300,000.\n\nThe distribution of feral camels in Australia in 2008. (Sourced: Australia State of Environment Report 2016) Source: Supplied\n\nExperts say a severely dehydrated camel can drink 100 litres of water in ten minutes.\n\nAs soon as rain returns, Ryan said the camels move on.\n\n\"Saturday night we got a little rain and Sunday night we got a good storm, and next morning the camels had disappeared like fairy floss,\" he said.\n\n\"The issue still stands, there are thousands of camels now, the camel experts say between seven and nine years, the herd doubles.\"\n\nLarge herds of camels in Mount Liebig have caused damage to fencing and water infrastructure. Source: Supplied / NT Government\n\nCalls for federal support\n\nBurgoyne says the NT government is doing what it can, but thinks \"the emphasis has really gone off\" solving the problem, calling for more money to undertake larger-scale culls.\n\n\"Local councils are quite literally having to hunt these camels out in the morning so that the communities can be safe,\" he said.\n\nYou imagine in Sydney or Melbourne, if a mob of feral camels came in, dug up the local water supply and residents were without water for a week or two, I think we would see absolute outrage.\n\nThe federal government said states and territories have primary responsibility for the management of invasive species.\n\nA Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water spokesperson said in a statement: \"Through the Saving Native Species program, the Australian Government has invested over $4.9 million in two projects delivered by the Northern Territory Government and Central Land Council.\"\n\n\"These projects aim to improve the habitat and help threatened species recover in the MacDonnell Ranges and include activities such as feral camel control.\"\n\nSafety and looking after animal welfare\n\nThe Central Land Council (CLC), which represents 90 elected Aboriginal men and women across southern NT, said there's a need to protect threatened species and country while keeping people safe.\n\nCLC representative Mischa Cartwright told SBS News the council culled more than 1,400 camels in 2025.\n\n\"There's really no other options than to go through a humane culling process,\" she said.\n\n\"I think communities, as long as they're consulted properly as part of that project, they're quite comfortable ... because it is about protecting our certain species in our country and the safety of our communities as well.\"\n\nConcerns have also been raised about the animals' welfare as local governments can't turn on water for huge numbers of camels.\n\n\"There maybe needs to be some outlying water points in the future for camels in that situation. And when I say outlying, they need to be a fair way away from communities,\" Ryan said.\n\nRyan has seen camels get stuck, as damaged water taps leak and make the ground muddy.\n\nDamien Ryan says camels are often found bogged in muddy ground after water taps are damaged. Source: Facebook / Tash Hughes\n\n\"They're perishing because of no water,\" he said.\n\n\"No matter what amount of pulling and tugging, we are not always successfully getting them out alive. They're stuck in the mud and it's very dangerous. They'll swing their head around, they'll give you a good old bite, they can damage you.\n\n\"Camel populations are not going to disappear and hopefully there's a business opportunity for somebody, but you can't create a business opportunity when the crisis starts. You need to do that well before.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

Source: AAP / Joel Carrett\n\nWith rain hitting Melbourne for the first time all tournament, the match was played under a closed roof on Rod Laver Arena, creating perfect indoor conditions for the women's game's two heaviest hitters.\n\nSabalenka and Rybakina were the first duo to joust for the title after contesting the season-ending final showpiece since Martina Hingis beat Lindsay Davenport in 1999.\n\nThe championship climax shaped as an intriguing showdown, with neither powerhouse combatant dropping a set en route to the final and Sabalenka shading their head-to-head record 8-6 and boasting a phenomenal 26 wins from her past 27 matches at the Open.\n\nBut the queen of Melbourne Park was taking on a fearsome foe who had won 19 of her past 20 matches herself and, among active players, only veteran former world No.1 Venus Williams boasts more wins over Sabalenka than Rybakina.\n\nUnder seige\n\nAnd the world No.1 was quickly under siege.\n\nWith booming groundstrokes, fifth-seeded Rybakina broke Sabalenka in the opening game of the match, then held to love in a clear early statement.\n\nRybakina was in trouble at 15-40 in the eighth game but fired down four huge serves to hold for 5-3 before coolly closing out the set.\n\nThe first woman since Hingis in 2002 to appear in at least four straight AO finals, Sabalenka had several opportunities to hit back early in the second set but squandered three break points in a 10-minute second game.\n\nSabalenka finally nabbed her first break of the match with Rybakina serving to stay in the second set at 4-5, the top seed levelling the contest after an hour and 25 minutes.\n\nFittingly, the first two women to clash in the final without having lost a set in the tournament since Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin in 2008 headed into a decider.\n\nSabalenka appeared on course for victory after surging to a 3-0 lead, only to dump a backhand into the net to allow Rybakina back on serve.\n\nThe lapse led to the world No.1 mentally unravelling as the Kazakh reeled off four straight games and sealed victory with an ace on her first match point after two hours and 18 minutes.\n\nWhile the 26-year-old rejoiced in becoming a dual grand slam champion, Sabalenka was left to digest suffering back-to-back finals defeats after also losing last year's title decider to Madison Keys.\n\nAs well as walking off with the trophy, Rybakina pocketed a monster cheque for $4.15 million and can look forward to a rankings rise to world No.3 on Monday.\n\nNo luck for Aussie doubles pair\n\nEarlier on Saturday, the Australian pair, Jason Kubler and Marc Polmans lost the Australian Open men's doubles final.\n\nKubler, partnering with fellow Australian Marc Polmans as plucky wildcards, went down against sixth seeds Christian Harrison and Neal Skupski in two sets in Saturday's tournament decider.\n\nBetter luck next time for Australian Open men's doubles runner-up, homegrown heroes Jason Kubler and Marc Polmans. Source: AAP / Joel Carrett\n\nBecoming the fifth British man to win multiple major doubles titles, former No.1 Skupski defied nerves to serve out the match.\n\nIt ends an unforgettable fortnight for newly engaged pair Kubler and Inglis, who between them have pocketed a life-changing $902,350.\n\nIf Kubler and Polmans had won the doubles final, that figure would have ballooned to a combined $1.27 million.\n\nKubler was vying for his second Australian Open men's doubles crown after teaming up with Rinky Hijikata to win the 2023 final.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

However, she later confessed to feeling anxious whenever she was on the stage.\n\n\"My crutch was, in improvs, when in doubt, play insane.

        "text": "A Chinese personal safety app called Are You Dead? \u2014 recently rebranded as Demumu \u2014 has gone viral in recent weeks, attracting widespread media attention.\n\nBehind its sudden popularity lie deeper social transformations, including demographic shifts and changing personal and family relationships.\n\nAt the same time, demand is growing for trust-based, non-medical, easy-to-use care networks tailored to the rapid rise of one-person households.\n\nDemumu also shows how digital technologies are not only responding to everyday safety concerns but also reshaping social and cultural norms.\n\nAs traditional kinship ties and community support structures weaken, technology is stepping in to fill \u2014 and capitalise on \u2014 the gaps.\n\nDemumu's virality: from local to global\n\nIn mid-2025, with a development cost of around 1,500 yuan ($308), three young Chinese professionals from Moonscape Technologies launched a personal safety app called Are You Dead?.\n\nThe app was designed to address the safety concerns of China's growing population of people who live alone. As described on its official store page, the app aims to \"protect every solitary moment with simple solutions and build a solid safety line for solo living\".\n\nUsers are prompted to click an on-screen button daily or fortnightly via their smartphone to verify they are alive. If a user fails to do so, the system automatically sends email alerts to two nominated emergency contacts.\n\nShortly after the app's release, it went viral and quickly became the most downloaded paid app in China.\n\nA 10 per cent stake in the company reportedly increased in value from 1 million yuan ($205,834) to nearly 10 million yuan ($2 million) within three days. This suggests an overall valuation of close to 100 million yuan ($20.57 million) for the developer.\n\nIn mid-January 2026, the app rebranded as Demumu as part of a global expansion.\n\nIt has now gained traction in more than 40 countries and is ranked near the top in global markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\nChina is moving towards smaller families and more individualised lives\n\nThe 2020 China Population Census showed there were more than 125 million one-person households in China. That's one in every four households in the country.\n\nAround two-thirds of these solo dwellers are aged between 20 and 59. It is estimated there will be 200 million such households by 2030.\n\nThe rapid rise of solo living in China can be attributed to several factors.\n\nFirst, a growing number of 'empty nest' older adults. This has been caused by population ageing, and the decline of marriage and fertility while divorce rates rise. These trends have been intensified by longer life expectancy and the legacy of the decades-long One Child Policy.\n\nREAD MORE China reimposes taxes on condoms, contraceptive drugs to spur flagging birth rate\n\nSecond, intimate relationships and family formation have become less attainable for many.\n\nMen are often expected to own a home and a car even at the courtship stage, which is increasingly difficult due to rising living costs and high property prices. 'Bride prices' \u2014 paid by a man's family to a woman's before marriage \u2014 are also escalating.\n\nThird, large-scale migration from rural to urban areas and between cities has produced many 'split households'.\n\nMillions of 'empty-nest youths' live alone for extended periods under intense work-related pressures before forming or reuniting with families. A common anxiety among this group is 'disappearing in loneliness'.\n\nLISTEN TO INTERVIEW: Loneliness - the hidden health danger SBS News 06:37 English\n\nNumerous reports have documented 'empty nesters' who died and were only found days, weeks, or even months later, particularly in gated urban communities. These incidents highlight the vulnerabilities associated with solo living, as well as the absence of trust-based safety networks.\n\nThis is a problem Demumu seeks to address.\n\nMoreover, among younger generations in China \u2013 particularly highly educated urban women \u2013 attitudes towards marriage and singlehood are shifting. Living alone is increasingly a deliberate choice.\n\nCareer development and personal autonomy are becoming higher priorities. Many women wish to avoid taking on a disproportionate share of domestic and caregiving responsibilities.\n\nSolo living: a high-potential market\n\nChina's singles economy is booming, and the market still has significant room to grow.\n\nIn major metropolitan centres such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, products and services tailored to people living alone are more and more visible.\n\nThese include one-person hotpot restaurants, single-person karaoke booths, and micro-apartments designed for solo dwellers. Compact household appliances such as mini-fridges, coffee machines, and kettles are also readily available, as well as solo travel packages offered by tourism agencies.\n\nCompanionship of various kinds is also on offer. Owning pets \u2014 particularly dogs and cats \u2014 often plays an important role in the everyday lives of people who live alone.\n\nThe intimate services market has also expanded rapidly through digital platforms and smartphone apps. This includes love mentoring and relationship counselling, online dating and digital romance games.\n\nAI-powered chatbot companions and humanoid dolls designed to meet the emotional and relational needs of solo dwellers are also becoming more common.\n\nThere's also an emerging niche business known as date-renting. This practice was initially popularised among young 'bare branches' seeking to bring a temporary partner home for Lunar New Year family gatherings.\n\nREAD MORE 2026 Lunar New Year: Celebrations Across Australia You Need to Know\n\nHowever, date-renting has since evolved into a personalised service economy in which individuals exchange intimacy, companionship, and dating experiences. In the process, dating is transformed into an 'emotional commodity', made visible for public consumption and increasingly shaped by platform profiteering.\n\nTogether with the emergence of safety apps such as Demumu, these singles-oriented businesses and technologies are energising China's solo-driven economy.\n\nMore importantly, they are also filling the gaps left by shrinking families and increasingly individualised living arrangements. In the process, they are reshaping contemporary social and personal relations and normalising single-centred cultures and lifestyles in everyday life.\n\nPan Wang is an associate professor in Chinese and Asian Studies at UNSW Sydney.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\nContinuing a family tradition that began in the late 1800s, Robert Mackenzie raises Black Angus cattle for sale locally and worldwide.\n\n\"China is a key part of our operation, they're taking roughly about 10 per cent of our production every month. And we're supplying a high-quality product from paddock to plate. And Australia has worked extremely hard to build that trust in China. Personally, I've been to China 16 times in ten years, so that shows our commitment to China.\"\n\nChinese television has even featured a live cross to Mr Mackenzie\u2019s Port Stephens property, promoting sustainability.\n\n\"To be featured in China TV, where 80 million people watched us - my family, my father - cook Australian red meat in the paddock right here is humbling, but that goes to show that China values our quality beef.\"\n\nHowever, from January, China\u2019s new rules will add a 55 per cent tariff to Australian beef imports exceeding specific quotas.\n\nThe Australian Meat Industry Council predicts a financial hit of up to $1 billion, as CEO Tim Ryan explains.\n\n\"A billion dollars is a lot of beef to redirect at relatively short notice and particularly for beef supply chains that aren't just a short-term decision. These animals have grown over multiple years and produced for certain markets. The last time I looked, there's not another China out there on the world market, so it's really hard to replace a destination with the scale and wealth of consumers as China.\"\n\nAustralia exported almost 300,000 tonnes of beef to China last year.\n\nMr Ryan says the new tariffs may cut that by a third.\n\n\"Australia's become a major supply of beef into the China market and over the last couple of decades, Chinese consumers have learned to love Australian beef. So, it'll hurt Australian producers that have targeted the China market specifically and they're the producers that will have to, I suppose, reconsider their business model going forward.\"\n\nTo protect its local industry, China has capped beef imports from Australia and several countries for the next three years.\n\n\"Under these new trade measures, Australia will be largely limited to trade about 205,000 tonnes of beef into the China market before 55% tariffs are triggered, which would largely make trade prohibitive for many exporters beyond that.\"\n\nCharcoal Chen is a China-based sales manager for an Australian cattle farm, with more than 20 years\u2019 experience.\n\nHe expects exporters of premium beef like Black Angus and Wagyu to be hardest hit.\n\n\"Structurally, lower-end grass-fed products are not heavily affected. The biggest impact will be on mid-to long-term grain-fed products, such as Wagyu, where volumes are relatively large.\"\n\nAnd that\u2019s forcing producers like Robert Mackenzie, who has cattle already fattening in feed lots, to urgently seek new markets.\n\n\"Our cattle are grass fed, grain finished. But those animals go into the feedlot for up to 200 days. And this is definitely put a speed bump in front of our operation that again, we have to scramble to work out exactly what are we going to do?\"\n\nMr Chen says exporters of chilled beef, which has a shorter shelf life, will be among the first forced to adapt.\n\n\"I expect the higher tariff to be enforced in the third quarter, around July or August 2026. Some distributors will encourage chilled-beef customers to switch to frozen products and increase frozen purchases in the first half to fill the supply gap later in this year.\"\n\nOther beef producing countries and big Australian producers are expected to move swiftly quickly to secure market share, says Mr Chen.\n\n\"It is survival of the fittest. If you hesitate and wait, you will be eliminated. Producers will have to adjust, whether by changing sales strategies, redirecting products to other markets, or absorbing them domestically.\"\n\nIt\u2019s a challenge for family producers like Robert Mackenzie who runs 3,500 commercial cows on eight properties.\n\n\"It's disappointing. We've worked as a family extremely hard on developing that market. We've spent a lot of money, a lot of money in China. It's not as simple as just going out and finding another market.\"",

But my countrymen they're still fighting, at the moment they're still fighting. But we just fought for the betterment of our family, to come here and use this opportunity.'",

        "text": "Professor Henry Brodaty has dedicated his life to dementia research and care.\n\nIt was seeing his father\u2019s diagnosis and death with the disease at just 59-years-old that led him to want to understand more about dementia.\n\nBrodaty, now 78, holds the titles of professor of ageing and mental health and co-director of UNSW Sydney\u2019s Centre for Healthy Brain Ageing (CHeBA) \u2014 and was on Australia day awarded the Senior Australian of the Year honour.\n\nMore than 420,000 Australians were living with dementia in 2024, according to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, and the disease was the leading cause of death in Australia in 2023.\n\nDementia is not one specific disease but is an umbrella term for a group of symptoms caused by disorders affecting the brain.\n\nREAD MORE More than a million Australians could be living with dementia in 40 years. These are possible risk factors\n\nDementia can impact memory, speech, thought, personality, behaviour and mobility. It is a degenerative, terminal illness.\n\nThe most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease.\n\nHowever, research published in the Lancet Commission in 2024 that 45 per cent of dementia cases are avoidable through lifestyle changes.\n\nIn his acceptance speech for the Senior Australian of the Year Award, Brodaty called for a whole-of-life approach to brain health.\n\nAfter spending most of his life trying to understand the disease, he shared with SBS News measures one can take to reduce or delay the risk of developing dementia.\n\nGet moving\n\nBrodaty said that \"both aerobic and strength training\" is good for reducing the risk of dementia, and encourages people to \"pull or push weight a couple days a week\".\n\nCHeBA notes that exercise is one of the best medicines available, and reduces the risk of not only dementia, but an array of other conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure, obesity and depression.\n\n\"Build regular exercise into your schedule \u2014 make time for it,\" Brodaty said.\n\n\"Going for a walk with your friend and chatting probably isn\u2019t enough. You need to get puffed and sweaty.\"\n\nUse your brain\n\nMuch like exercise, complex mental activity strengthens and enhances the function of the brain.\n\nBy learning throughout our lives and supporting kids\u2019 education, we can reduce the risk of dementia.\n\n\"In the early stages of life, it\u2019s getting an education \u2014 the more education you have, the greater your cognitive reserve. It\u2019s like a buffer,\" he told SBS.\n\nProfessor Henry Brodaty AO has reshaped the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of dementia, enhancing the lives of countless people in Australia and around the world. Source: AAP / Mick Tsikas\n\n\"So we may build up pathology in our brain, but our ability to withstand the effects of it are improved if we have more cognitive reserve. And that whole process of buffering against pathology is called resilience. So it's cognitive resilience.\"\n\nThe CHeBA recommends not only formal education, but also learning a new skill, language or dance, socialising, volunteering and brain training as ways to ensure complex mental activity.\n\nEating a good diet\n\n\"Particularly based on the Mediterranean diet: lots of vegetables, legumes, extra virgin olive oil, almonds, walnuts,\" Brodaty said.\n\nHe also encourages people to avoid drinking excess alcohol.\n\nCHeBA recommends a healthy, balanced diet rich in micronutrients, proteins, essential oils and complex carbohydrates.\n\nIn 2024, two new dementia risk factors were updated to the standing Lancet Commission on dementia prevention, intervention and care. One of them being high LDL [Low-density lipoprotein, otherwise known as \"bad\"] cholesterol. It\u2019s important to monitor your cholesterol and reduce consuming foods with high saturated and trans fats.\n\nProtect your head\n\n\"People worry more about their hair than what\u2019s underneath it. We should treasure our brains,\" Brodaty said.\n\nHe encourages the use of helmets when riding bicycles or playing contact sports.\n\n\"We need to be as conscious of our brains as we do our heart.\"\n\nBrodaty and a team of researchers ran a study called Maintain Your Brain which involved 8,000 people between the ages of 55 and 77 who did not already have dementia.\n\nThey found that through online coaching and support in the areas of physical activity, nutrition, brain training and mental health, the participant\u2019s overall cognition improved.\n\nThis was compared to the other half of participants who only received publicly available information on dementia and risk reduction.\n\n\"The group that got the coaching improved almost three times as much ... we think our program delayed the onset at least a year.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nE-bikeshare company Lime is chasing repeat customers with cheaper trips, in some cases five times less than standard rates, as it tries to turn public transport-reliant commuters into members and grow ahead of its expected stock market launch in the US. While its strategy is company-wide, with subscriptions first introduced in 2021, the Uber-backed firm has ramped up its latest member drive in Sydney where, towards the end of last year, it tweaked its LimePrime plan cost and per minute rates to nudge more customers into signing up. In cities like Melbourne, traditional rates for Lime still apply, with casual fees charged at $1 to unlock its electric-assisted vehicles and up to 60 cents per minute of rental, with a 20-minute trip costing roughly $13. Rates differ by vehicle type. Head of Lime Australia, William Peters, riding one of their many bikes. Nick Moir Under its new LimePrime offering in Sydney, members who pay $4.99 per month do not have to pay any fees to unlock bikes, with flat fares of $1.50 for trips under five minutes and $2.75 for rides up to 20 minutes. Trips over 20 minutes will be charged at a discounted rate of 29 cents per minute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new Sydney-only LimePrime product offers substantially improved savings compared with the old plans still available in other cities where subscription is $5.99 per month and there are no discounted riding rates. The company has also begun introducing its newest generation of e-bikes in Sydney, which it says make for a smoother ride and more secure helmet locking. While Sydney is the first Australian market with the improved LimePrime plan and bikes, the company has hit regulatory barriers to offering its e-scooters \u2013 which are popular in other cities such as Melbourne \u2013 with authorities in central Sydney yet to authorise their use. Lime first launched in Australia in 2018, and has faced intense competition both here and globally. While key competitors Beam and Neuron merged in September, players such as oBike, Mobike, Ofo, ReddyGo and Airbike have popped up before abruptly vanishing from Australian streets. The legacy of failed operators, however, lives on, said Dr Elliot Fishman, the director of the Melbourne-based Institute for Sensible Transport who completed a PhD comparing bike share schemes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt has become harder for new businesses to come in because of councils who need to grant them approvals, and basically, anyone will remember seeing the bikes thrown in rivers, the bikes scattered on footpaths and in parks.\u201d Related Article E-Scooters Six hospitalised during seven hours of e-scooter carnage overnight \u201cThe bike share sector has been so crowded, there\u2019s a sense that for some it\u2019s only a matter of time before they go out of business, and it\u2019s a real liability for cities and governments when they have to deal with stranded or locked up bikes and a bankrupt company can\u2019t clean up their own mess,\u201d he said. Optimistic investors rushed to back various startups early on, but Fishman said the focus for operators now was consolidation and differentiation \u2013 whether by product or price \u2013 to demonstrate how they can survive. Lime cutting prices for regular users could be one such tactic, Fishman said. \u201cThe industry can get dangerous because there\u2019s this winner takes all mentality.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLime\u2019s integration with the Uber app and global presence has also contributed to its broader accessibility. A Lime spokesperson did not respond to questions about whether it was losing money from the significantly cheaper rental rates being offered in Sydney, or whether its push for members was related to its planned stock market launch. Related Article NSW State Parliament \u2018It\u2019s just insane\u2019: Doctors, lawyers back green slips for e-bikes However, a source with knowledge of the company\u2019s business model said that the cheaper rates could still be profitable if it converted enough users into members. \u201cYou want people to say \u2018why don\u2019t I just use these bikes all the time\u2019,\u201d they said. \u201cYou absolutely can make money on these rates. Yes, the paying as you go rates are far more profitable, but because if you\u2019re a member you\u2019re doing more trips, if they do enough it can definitely be viable [for Lime].\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe source said that Lime viewed Sydney as a good test city for new bike technology and discount offers because of its improving bike infrastructure and strong customer demand, before rolling changes out to other markets in Australia and around the world. \u201cI think the company\u2019s primary goal is getting people moving from thinking about Lime as a \u2018sometimes\u2019 product to one they use every day,\u201d the source said. Fishman said low-cost high-use schemes effective in cities such as London and Paris, where average uses per bike can exceed 10 per day. Additionally, with Lime \u201csweating their assets\u201d by encouraging more frequent rides, they also make their vehicles more visible, in itself a form of advertisement. Lime\u2019s latest push comes as industry observers expect the San Francisco-based transport startup to push ahead with its plans for a stock market launch this year in the United States, after the company reportedly hired several large US investment banks to help with its initial public offering. Lime, which offers bikes and scooters in more than 280 cities across more than 30 countries, had previously planned to make the company public in 2022.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIts latest global push for growth could see its IPO this year value the firm higher than its Uber-led funding round in 2020, when reports suggested a valuation of about $US510 million.

Having spent her Divinyls career playing a fiery, racy, pouting, unpredictable schoolgirl, she wanted a character this time, too, reportedly settling on a crow. It was never to be. She died of breast cancer before the half-formed dream took flight. Enter Sheridan Harbridge, Glenn Moorhouse and Sarah Goodes. Together, they envisaged a ghost of the show Amphlett had contemplated, subtitling it The Exquisite Rock and Rage of Chrissy Amphlett. Harbridge wrote it, with Moorhouse as musical director and Goodes directing Harbridge\u2019s performance. They\u2019ve done a storming job. Sheridan Harbridge as Chrissy Amphlett in a potent performance. Jade Ellis Harbridge doesn\u2019t become Chrissy, in the sense that the story is told in the third person, but Amphlett\u2019s spirit is alive and living dangerously inside Harbridge\u2019s performance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat a range the latter has, from being the best Blanche I\u2019ve seen in A Streetcar Named Desire, to now exploding off the stage with a singing voice I didn\u2019t know she had, that could be brutally powerful when required, yet also sweetly soulful. Harbridge\u2019s voice can be brutally powerful but also sweetly soulful. Jade Ellis Beyond the potency of her performance and the engaging storytelling, the music and spoken word are interwoven so that a Divinyls hit might start, shudder to a stop while Harbridge tells us more, pick up again, and repeat this process. It\u2019s done so well that you\u2019re not cursing the fact that they won\u2019t get on with the song; you\u2019re engrossed in an ever-growing tension that finally finds release when the song takes centre-stage. Sheridan Harbridge in full flight. Jade Ellis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother strength is the music itself, with Moorhouse (on guitar) joined by Clarabell Limonta (keyboard), Ben Cripps (bass) and Dave Hatch (drums). I never particularly rated Divinyls as a band, compared with their songs and Amphlett\u2019s performance of them. Moorhouse and company have knocked some bricks out of the wall of sound and replaced them with nuance, without losing the kick to the surging chorus of, say, Boys in Town. Related Article What\u2019s on Chrissy Amphlett wrote a show in which she was a crow. Years after her death, her vision lives on The fearless Harbridge, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t just enter the audience, she invades it. She\u2019s also funny, and the humour makes for a completeness of emotional impact, given the inherent sadness of a story of excess, of Amphlett\u2019s repeatedly having to smash the same glass ceiling, and then suffering multiple sclerosis before the cancer hit. Perhaps it\u2019s also so moving because the show exudes such immense affection for its subject. If the intensity of grip is released a little in the final phase, it\u2019s certainly reasserted when they launch into I Touch Myself, the song that made the teenage Harbridge a fan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI suspect Amphlett would approve. She\u2019d have appreciated the absence of hagiography and sugar-coating, and she may have recognised a fellow traveller in the high-stakes game of being audacious on stage. She may have even stood up with the rest of us at the end. MUSIC\n\nThe Whitlams and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra\n\nState Theatre, January 31\n\nReviewed by SHAMIM RAZAVI\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd The Whitlams were early adopters of the now-fashionable \u201c\u2026 and symphony\u201d trend, returning to it intermittently over the past 20 years. It is a format that frontman Tim Freedman freely admits can be reduced to \u201csome strings on top of our chords\u201d \u2013 a reduction he spends the evening trying to disprove. His counterargument opens convincingly with Beauty in Me with the two elements in balance: the orchestra afforded the space to carry the opening lines on their own, with Freedman on piano and daughter Alice on vocals, joining in as the song unfolds. This sets up the template for the night: agreeable, well-balanced and designed to amplify the band\u2019s hallmark pretty tunes. Tim Freedman. Sitthixay Ditthavong\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe effect is more interesting when inverted, the swelling strings pulling counter to the sardonic lyrics of Fondness Makes the Heart Grow Absent, heightening the slight-of-hand tricksy of the original. The same effect is even more powerful on Melbourne, the tale of righteous outsider contrarianism that gains bite when delivered with the buttoned-up formality of the symphony. Twenty years of orchestral toying has thrown up the occasional gem, chief among them Out the Back, co-written with distinguished composer Peter Sculthorpe. No mere rearrangement for strings, this is a genuine three-way conversation between guitarist Jak Housden\u2019s languid line, Freedman\u2019s lazy lyrics and the orchestra\u2019s expansive response. On record, it is clever and tight \u2013 live, it takes beautiful flight. The Whitlams were an early adopter of the symphony concert and use the format well. Sitthixay Ditthavong The arrangement of Up Against the Wall by the masterful Benjamin Northey similarly transcends the strings-atop-chords formula: a meaningful reworking rather than just pretty ornamentation. In both pieces, the orchestral accompaniment doesn\u2019t merely add depth but illumination, drawing out the Irish folk-inflected lines that underpin so much of the Whitlams\u2019 songwriting. All of which is to say that too much of the remainder amounted to an amiable but unrevealing run through the band\u2019s back catalogue. Sure, their hits are still fabulous and Blow Up The Pokies sounds even better with 30 more musicians whirling away. For all we are given, we are left wanting: more reimagining, less reupholstering.

Over the past 12 months the precious metal has been one of the biggest movers in the commodity market, with its value more than doubling and increasing at a rate faster than gold. Silver has recently outpaced gold as the in terms of the highest increase in value over the past 12 months. Bloomberg While silver is commonly associated with jewellery due to its malleability and shine, the metal is also known as a good conductor of electricity. Almost all electrical appliances use silver contacts and switches. Microwaves, dishwashers, TVs, telephones, toys and computers all contain silver. However, more recently the metal is used in solar cells where it helps to conduct sunlight into electricity.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerth Mint Institutions and Business Solutions General Manager John O\u2019Donoghue said silver had seen a significant rally over the past 12 months, supported by growing investor demand and strong industrial consumption. \u201cFrom a price perspective, silver finished December 2024 at $46.50 (AUD) an ounce and 12 months on, in December 2025, it fetched more than $100 an ounce and is currently priced around $168 an ounce,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been an extraordinary time for the precious metals market with gold and silver prices setting new records almost daily. \u201cGold was up more than 50 per cent in Australian dollar terms in the year to 31 December 2025, and silver rose more than 130 per cent for the year. That momentum has continued into 2026.\u201d O\u2019Donoghue said the higher price for silver has been driven by many of the same factors influencing recent rise in the gold price.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThat is, global economic uncertainty and geopolitical instability which continues to support safe-haven buying. \u201cCoupled with this is strong industrial demand for silver given its use in electric vehicles, photovoltaics and other technologies. \u201cWe are also seeing elements of momentum\u2011based or \u2018FOMO\u2019 trading in the market. \u201cWhen prices rise quickly, some investors feel compelled to enter the market to avoid missing out on further gains, and that additional demand can amplify the upward movement.\u201d One kilogram silver bars stacked at the Perth Mint Refinery. Bloomberg\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Western Australia, silver is way down on the list of major mining exports, outweighed by the traditional resources including iron ore, copper, natural gas and gold. According to the most recent available data from the Department of Mining, Petroleum and Exploration, quarterly production of silver peaked in terms of value in the three months ending in December of 2021, when the metal brought the state $46.43 million from 46.32 tonnes. That compares to the December quarter last year when just 27.89 tonnes of silver brought in $45.35 million to the state. WA School of Mines Chair of Extractive Metallurgy Professor Jacques Eksteen said while silver often holds a stronger value than other metals, it is predominantly mined as a by-product. \u201cSilver is normally a by-product of base metal mining and sometimes gold mines,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt is seldom the dominant metal (in quantity) of a given mine, although it may lead in value.\u201d Eksteen added that WA is not widely known for large silver deposits and the precious metal is more commonly found in Queensland. \u201cThe most important silver mine in Australia is the Cannington silver-lead-zinc mine in Queensland and is owned by South32,\u201d he said. \u201cSilver recovery is non-trivial due to a complex chemistry and reagent requirement to maintain it stable in solution. \u201cIt has a wide diversity in forms of mineralisation, but where it is associated with lead and zinc. It can be fairly easily recovered as a sulfide concentrate using flotation which then is processed further at a refinery using predominantly high-temperature processes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the majority of silver mined in WA comes as a by-product from other base metal operations, Dr ALex Walker, a research fellow at John de Laeter Centre in Curtin University, said there were two sites in the state that were exploring the extraction of silver as a primary ore. \u201cElizabeth Hill operated until 2000 when the silver price dropped below US$5 per ounce,\u201d he said. \u201cHosting bonanza-grade silver, gravity separation was used to concentrate the native silver. \u201cIt and the surrounding tenement space is now occupied by West Coast Silver which is busy establishing the extent of mineralisation beyond the historic workings. The company is collaborating with Curtin to characterise the silver mineralisation.\u201d According to West Coast Silver, the Elizabeth Hill operation, based in the Pilbara, has a proven history of silver production. Between 1998 and 2000, the mine produced 1.2 million ounces of silver from just 16,830 tonnes of ore, achieving a head grade of 2194 grams per tonne.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Gold The surging commodity that now accounts for a quarter of WA\u2019s mining workforce The other major silver producer is the Abra silver-lead mine, about 200km north-west of Meekatharra, which Walker said was also working with Curtin University. \u201cThe Abra silver-lead mine, now owned and operated by Endurance Mining, has historically been heavy on lead extraction,\u201d he said. \u201cEndurance is leaning into exploring silver deportment in the deposit in collaboration with Curtin University.\u201d O\u2019Donoghue said the rise in the value of silver had seen customers take the opportunity to cash out of their silver holdings and realise gains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cElevated prices typically encourage investors to rebalance their holdings, and that\u2019s evident from the activity we\u2019re seeing,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Perth Mint purchases silver bullion from customers. Unlike gold, we don\u2019t purchase silver jewellery.\u201d O\u2019Donoghue said the enormous demand for precious metals, and in particular silver bullion products, has resulted in unprecedented logistical and production challenges for the Mint to meet the volume of orders it is receiving, meaning it has had to limit the availability of some silver products. \u201cWe know this is disappointing for our customers. We\u2019re working hard to meet the surge while maintaining the highest standards for precision and quality,\u201d he said. \u201cOur inspection, packing and dispatching processes are highly manual. Every coin, bar and numismatic product is individually inspected, and items require careful handling as they are placed into sleeves, tubes or boxes. \u201cWe\u2019re increasing staffing to speed up these processes and thank customers for their patience.\u201d\n\nSave You have reached your maximum number of saved items.

Got it Share A A A\n\nSpaceX is requesting permission to launch as many as 1 million satellites into the Earth\u2019s orbit in order to pull off Elon Musk\u2019s latest grand vision of putting data centers in space to do complex computing for artificial intelligence. In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission made late Friday, SpaceX said it\u2019s creating the solar-powered network in order to \u201caccommodate the explosive growth of data demands driven by AI.\u201d SpaceX proposes that the Sun - shown here in an image from the Solar Dynamics Observatory during a geomagnetic storm watch last year - would directly power the AI data centres in space. NASA/AP \u201cLaunching a constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centres is a first step towards becoming a Kardashev II-level civilisation \u2014 one that can harness the Sun\u2019s full power \u2014 while supporting AI-driven applications for billions of people today and ensuring humanity\u2019s multi-planetary future amongst the stars,\u201d SpaceX wrote in the filing. The system, which could be launched via the company\u2019s reusable Starship rocket, would serve as a lower-cost and more environmentally friendly alternative to land-based data centres, the filing states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Opinion\n\nTrump's America Trump is driving America into a new dark age Instead of requiring cooling systems that use large volumes of water like those on land, the network would rely on radiative cooling that occurs in space, which allows for the dissipation of heat. It would also reduce the need to rely on batteries, since it would acquire energy from the Sun, according to the filing. Musk responded to reports of the filing on X early Saturday morning, stating \u201cI thought we\u2019d start small and work our way up\u201d. The satellites, which will use laser links to communicate with each other, will be launched between an altitude of 500 km (310.69 miles) and 2,000 km in an orbit that would provide them near constant access to the Sun, according to the filing. SpaceX founder Elon Musk says the lowest cost place to put AI will be space, and \u201cthat\u2019ll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest\u201d. JOHN RAOUX\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe FCC request comes as SpaceX, which is eyeing an IPO later this year, is exploring a potential merger with Musk\u2019s xAI, a tie-up that would consolidate cash flow while bringing together capabilities in artificial intelligence, satellite production and rocket launches, Bloomberg has reported. SpaceX is also considering an alternative combination with Tesla Inc. Musk has publicly spoken about the need for orbital data centres and his companies\u2019 ambitions to pioneer the technology, most recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer for building AI data centres in space,\u201d Musk said at the forum. \u201cThe lowest cost place to put AI will be space, and that\u2019ll be true within two years, maybe three at the latest.\u201d Bloomberg The Business Briefing newsletter delivers major stories, exclusive coverage and expert opinion.

        "text": "An ACT Supreme Court justice has delivered a surprise nod to an Australian cult classic during a verdict in favour of public housing tenants, who claimed a government policy had breached their human rights.\n\nThe three Canberra women who filed the complaint had been living in ACT public housing for between 27 and 42 years, before being ordered to move in 2020 and 2022 under the state government\u2019s Growing and Renewing Public Housing Program.\n\nBy their inclusion in the ACT government\u2019s program, the properties in question were to be sold to the private market or redeveloped once the existing tenants were relocated.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nBut on Friday, Justice Verity McWilliam found the three women had been denied procedural fairness in the decision to evict them, and there had not received proper consideration to their human rights.\n\nACT Justice Verity McWilliam delivered her verdict on Friday.\n\nIn a publicly released judgment, Justice McWilliam said the crux of the dispute was the lawfulness of the actions of the Commissioner for Social Housing and its agents in forcing the trio to relocate.\n\nShe wrote: \u201cIt need hardly be said that any interference with one\u2019s home must be lawful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat pithy one-liner in The Castle (1997), voiced in the fictional character of Darryl Kerrigan, still resonates: It\u2019s not a house, it\u2019s a home. A man\u2019s home is his castle \u2026 You can\u2019t just walk in and steal our homes,\u201d Justice McWilliam wrote.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nWhile Justice McWilliam noted the quote referenced a constitutional legal protection, not a state one, she argued the sentiment there was the same and that those \u201cwords have deep roots\u201d.\n\nThe line in question was delivered by Darryl Kerrigan (left), played by Michael Caton, in the 1997 film. Picture: filmstills\n\nShe then quoted Roman philosopher Cicero, writing: \u201cExpressions of a person\u2019s connection to their home stem back to at least Roman times, when Cicero (the Roman statesman and lawyer) wrote: What more sacred, what more strongly guarded by every holy feeling, than a man\u2019s own home?\u201d\n\nThe court has now ordered the trio\u2019s legal costs be paid by the Commissioner, with all three women remaining in their homes.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the Commissioner conceded there was a denial of procedural fairness, but entirely disputed the trio\u2019s human rights claim.\n\nIn the ACT, public authorities must act consistently in accordance with human rights to comply with the state\u2019s Human Rights Act, and under this legislation, the concept of a person\u2019s home as being inviolable, or fundamentally protected from unlawful or arbitrary interference, is also recognised.",

It was just something entirely new for me here,\u201d she explained.\n\nThere are some beaches in the US with specialised mats for wheelchair users, and they are often referred to as Mobi-mats.\n\nLex, her husband and their son are enjoying exploring Australia. They\u2019re not sure how long their work will keep them here, so they\u2019re trying to soak up every moment before time runs out.\n\nWhile Lex has previously spoken to Yahoo Lifestyle about her fascination with Aussie petrol stations and supermarket shopping trolleys, she said her favourite thing \u201cabove all is the \u2018mateship\u2019 and sense of community we feel living here\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cAussies have each other\u2019s backs.
