(Dominic Lorrimer/AFR)\n\n\"Certainly part of the way monetary policy works is through the housing market, but I would not accept that the Reserve Bank is responsible for the housing price issues in this country,\" Bullock, who wasn't appointed as governor until 2023, replied.\n\nWhen challenged on that by McKim, who put to her that the RBA \"doesn't accept any responsibility whatsoever in the housing price spike\", Bullock pointed to an oft-cited factor as the genuine culprit.\n\n\"The problem is the lack of supply relative to demand, and when monetary policy eases and housing demand picks up, supply can't pick up as quickly, and that's where you end up,\" she said.\n\n\"But it's not monetary policy's responsibility to look after housing prices.\"\n\n\ufeff Having previously said that it would be at least two years before Australia started to see some relief from price surges , despite governments starting to focus on increasing supply, Bullock reiterated that fixing the country's housing stock was a long, slow process.\n\n\"It takes time to get approvals and one of the big things is higher density housing and that by its nature takes much longer,\" she said.\n\n\"It is not something that you can just turn the switch and say 'alright, now we're off and running', it really takes time.\"\n\nBullock also frustrated McKim by telling him investors weren't significantly exacerbating the housing crisis at the moment, and by refusing to be drawn on whether removing the capital gains tax discount for property would slow price rises.\n\nNick McKim was one of several senators to question Bullock in the hearing. (Dominic Lorrimer/AFR)\n\n\"I have done no particular analysis on what removal of the capital gains tax might do,\" she said.\n\n\"It's (not) my job to tell the government what they should do with the policy,\" she added.\n\nHowever, when asked by Liberal senator Andrew Bragg about the impact of the federal government's expanded first home guarantee scheme, Bullock said it was possible it would lead to house prices going \"a little higher\" in the short-term.\n\nBut as for the medium-term impacts, she said that would depend on \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 supply.",

        "text": "Isla Steed is your fairly typical teenager, according to her mum.\n\nThe 14-year-old is \"a stubborn little person\" who loves technology and food, Kylie Steed says.\n\nAnd she has a favourite word \u2014 \"no\".\n\nBut what sets Isla apart from her peers is something she shares with just 34 other people in the world, and just three others in Australia.\n\nHer condition is so extremely rare, when she was born, it had not even been discovered yet.\n\nKylie Steed says her daughter Isla is the happiest person she knows. (ABC Eyre Peninsula: Duncan Bailey)\n\nIt is known by its acronym CHOPS, which stands for its signs and symptoms: cognitive impairment and coarse facial features; heart defects; obesity; pulmonary problems; and short stature and skeletal abnormalities.\n\nThe condition was not identified by researchers until 2015.\n\nIt would take another four years for Isla to be diagnosed, at the age of eight, with the genetic disease.\n\nUp until then, doctors had mistakenly diagnosed her with Cornelia de Lange syndrome, another genetic condition with similar features.\n\nThis is a common scenario for children who are later diagnosed with CHOPS, according to advocates for people with the disease.\n\n\"When Isla was born, she was quite unhealthy,\" Isla's mum said.\n\n\"She weighed 1,500 grams [1.5 kilograms] and spent the first 147 days in the Women's and Children's [Hospital in Adelaide].\n\nIsla required a feeding tube and, at one point, had to be resuscitated through CPR.\n\n\"There was no way we would have been able to live here [Port Lincoln] and keep her alive,\" Ms Steed said.\n\nIsla Steed was not diagnosed with CHOPS syndrome until she was eight years old. (Supplied: Kylie Steed)\n\nThe family had to temporarily relocate to Adelaide during the early years of Isla's life.\n\nBut eventually, when Isla was 11 years old, she was deemed well enough for the Steed family to return home to Port Lincoln on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula.\n\nDespite their regional city being under pressure from the same resources and staffing shortfalls as the public heath sector throughout regional and rural Australia, Isla has access to a \"full repertoire\" of support services in Port Lincoln, Ms Steed said.\n\nWhile she still needs frequent check-ups, her condition is also far more stable now than when she was a child, her mum added.\n\nConnecting through CHOPS\n\nWhile Isla's disease is rare, she's not alone.\n\nAdvocates across the globe have spent years trying to bring CHOPS syndrome into the spotlight and fundraise for research projects.\n\nIn Palermo, Italy, astrophysicist Manuela Mallamaci described her son Mario's diagnosis as \"a nightmare\" in 2023.\n\n\"But me and my husband said, 'OK, we need to do something, we cannot cry all the time,'\" Ms Mallamaci said.\n\nManuela Mallamaci felt inspired to advocate for CHOPS syndrome after her son Mario's diagnosis in 2023. (Supplied: Manuela Mallamaci)\n\nUnbeknown to her, across the ditch in the USA, there was a growing network of CHOPS families.\n\nLainey Moseley, a journalist in Philadelphia, founded CHOPS Syndrome Global after her daughter Leta became the first in the world to be diagnosed with the disease in 2015.\n\nAfter the two mothers connected online, Ms Mallamaci realised she could use her research background to try to find scientific answers.\n\nShe created Fondazione CHOPS, and began working alongside Ms Moseley's foundation to fundraise for research projects and connect CHOPS families across the world.\n\nManuela Mallamaci says it is important to know other families affected by rare diseases. (Supplied: Manuela Mallamaci)\n\n\"It was our starting point, meeting doctors and experts all over the world about this syndrome,\" Ms Mallamaci said.\n\n\"We are just a few people, but it is important to know other families.\"\n\nBeing a 'rare disease parent'\n\nLainey Moseley's daughter Leta, now 28 years old, was the first in the world to receive the CHOPS syndrome diagnosis.\n\nBut that didn't come until 18 years after her birth.\n\nThe intervening years were \"incredibly isolating\", Ms Moseley said, via Zoom from Philadelphia.\n\nLeta Moseley (left) was the first person in the world to be diagnosed with CHOPS syndrome. (Supplied: Lainey Moseley)\n\n\" But we're not unique, this is the story for thousands and thousands of families [with rare diseases] who are isolated and feeling like they're all alone and forgotten. \"\n\nMs Moseley felt she could not sit still after Leta was diagnosed, and spearheaded a campaign to bring CHOPS syndrome into the spotlight for the first time.\n\nIt led to the creation of CHOPS Syndrome Global in 2019.\n\n\"Because she was the first diagnosed in the world, I didn't really have a choice,\" Ms Moseley said.\n\nIt wasn't until Leta Moseley was 18 years old that she was diagnosed with CHOPS syndrome. (Supplied: Lainey Moseley)\n\n\"That's what you do as a rare disease parent when you get a diagnosis and you don't have a community.\n\n\"You don't have information about what the gene mutation is, and you can't even call doctors or scientists because they don't know either.\"\n\nChange in instruction gene\n\nBefore CHOPS had a name, Kosuke Izumi was studying a genetic anomaly alongside his former mentor, physician Ian Krantz, in the US.\n\nThe research was centred on better understanding Cornelia de Lange syndrome and involved studying hundreds of children.\n\nOf that large number, Dr Izumi recalled three children standing out \u2014 and one of them was Leta Moseley.\n\nKosuke Izumi is one of the leading researchers into CHOPS syndrome. (Supplied: Kosuke Izumi)\n\n\"We found three children with fairly similar medical problems but we thought they were a bit different with children from Cornelia de Lange syndrome,\" Dr Izumi said.\n\n\"This was around 2012 and we started thinking about whether these children may have a new genetic disorder.\"\n\nAround that time, a breakthrough in genetic testing called exome sequencing became available.\n\nDr Izumi said this allowed them to \"spellcheck\" genetic information in a comprehensive way.\n\nLainey Moseley believes a treatment for CHOPS syndrome will be found in her lifetime. (Supplied: Lainey Moseley)\n\n\"To test our hypothesis, which is that these children have a new genetic diagnosis, we used this new approach,\" he said.\n\n\"We identified a change in a gene called AFF4 and named it CHOPS syndrome as an acronym for their medical problem.\n\n\"Because this gene plays an important role in directing what kind of function the cell needs to do, as a consequence of dysfunction, children with CHOPS syndrome have many medical problems.\"\n\nNeed for more awareness\n\nDespite the odds against her, Isla's disease has not stopped her from loving people and loving life.\n\n\"She's one of the happiest people I know,\" Ms Steed said.\n\nToday, Isla is able to access most therapeutic services in Port Lincoln, but initially, a lack of awareness about the disease among the health sector made that challenging.\n\nIsla Steed lives in Port Lincoln with her mum Kylie, her dad Matt and her brother, Harry. (ABC Eyre Peninsula: Duncan Bailey)\n\n\"Therapy services have been tricky to find, we've been on lots of waitlists and finally have a full repertoire of speech [pathologists], occupational therapists and physios [physiotherapists],\" Ms Steed said.\n\n\"But no-one really knows much about it, so it can be really tricky.\n\n\" In terms of having a kid with a disability it can be super complex; your entire life is different to everybody else's and a lot of people don't understand what you go through. \"\n\nWhile Isla faces unique challenges in life, Kylie Steed says she loves people and life. (ABC Eyre Peninsula: Duncan Bailey)\n\nMs Mallamaci and Ms Moseley have not lost hope a treatment can one day be found for CHOPS.\n\n\"In my lifetime, we will have a treatment for CHOPS syndrome,\" Ms Moseley said.\n\n\"Whether it's a repurposed drug or gene therapy \u2026 we will have something to offer families and children who are born with CHOPS syndrome \u2014 an immediate treatment option for their child because that's what they deserve.\"\n\nDr Izumi said he too was hopeful.\n\n\"We are using a specialised cell called induced pluripotent stem cell, which can be generated from patient cells,\" he said.\n\n\"That can be differentiated into brain cells or muscle cells which the patient has symptoms on.\n\n\"We're trying to find a way to fix this abnormality, and have been using animal models to study what kind of drug could be useful.\n\n\"I may be too optimistic but there should be a way to do something.\"",

        "text": "A constitutional fight is brewing over Australia's world-first social media ban, according to top legal scholars.\n\nYouTube emerged as the most likely source of a challenge to the ban in July, when parent company Google first raised the prospect.\n\nBut experts in constitutional and media law told the ABC that doubts about the ban's constitutional validity extended well beyond the board rooms of the companies that would stand to gain from a victory.\n\nThey argue the policy could ultimately be overturned in the High Court because of its impact on the implied right to freedom of political communication, and believe that young climate activists such as 16-year-old Ivy Sheng showcase that risk.\n\nClimate campaigner Ivy Sheng is worried banning teens from social media will stunt their political education. (Supplied)\n\nThe year 10 student uses Instagram to promote her podcast about environmental justice, as well as sharing her political views with a wide network, including both adults and younger students.\n\nShe credits much of her \"political education\" to social media.\n\n\"There wasn't really one specific moment where I suddenly switched on [politically], but I was about 12,\" she said.\n\nIvy will scrape past the new social media age limit of 16 when it takes effect on December 10, but many of her peers are preparing to lose access to their accounts once platforms start checking ages, as required by Australian law.\n\n\"That's the first group that I'm reaching and so with this ban in place, that's going to be a group that we're losing,\" she said.\n\nThe social platforms that could be forced to ban under-16s Photo shows A person holding a mobile phone surrounded by icons from social media platforms WhatsApp, Roblox, Reddit and Discord are among an expanded list of platforms which may be covered by the teen social media ban, the ABC can reveal.\n\nIvy said social media had become the main place where young people developed their political views, and represented their best opportunity to be heard by people who were old enough to vote.\n\n\"Having young people step up and say, like, hey, this is going to impact my future \u2014 I think that's probably the most important thing that's going to bring more older people into the [climate] movement,\" she said.\n\n\"If people aren't able to access \u2026 social media, they won't be thinking about this when they go into their teens and when they [reach] voting age.\n\n\"And that's just not something that is beneficial for us, I think, as a society.\"\n\nMurmurs about a constitutional challenge began a week before the bill had even been passed, when top constitutional scholar Anne Twomey, from the University of Sydney, raised a similar argument in November 2024 on her YouTube channel.\n\n\"This law [is not] going to get kids off their devices and out into the back garden,\" Professor Twomey said in a subsequent video posted two months ago.\n\nA constitutional fight is brewing over Australia\u2019s world-first social media ban. (ABC News)\n\n\"Nor is it going to do much to protect them from harm.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Professor Twomey argued the new law would likely \"burden\" their political communication.\n\n\"A young person could not make comments on videos on YouTube, indicate likes or dislikes for videos, or upload their own videos.\n\n\"This is likely to be where any burden lies because it would inhibit the person from engaging in political debate,\" she said.\n\nThe tech war quietly raging behind the social media ban Photo shows Images of 'old man' face used to bypass social media age bans. From December 10, social media platforms will be forced to block under 16s in Australia from holding accounts, but experts warn age checks can be easily bypassed in several ways, including a $22 \"old man\" mask.\n\nThe Human Rights Law Centre (HRLC) also raised the prospect of a constitutional challenge in its submission to an inquiry into the bill, right before it was passed.\n\n\"In the modern era, social media platforms are one of the primary tools for political communication,\" the submission stated.\n\n\"It is actually a legitimate objective of government to keep children, and indeed all people, safe online,\" said David Mejia-Canales, a senior lawyer at HRLC.\n\n\"But the legislation, as it is right now, is a really poor solution to a genuine problem.\"\n\nHow a High Court challenge may play out\n\nA constitutional fight over the teen social media ban would not be an easy case to win, experts said.\n\nThat is in part because the implied right to political communication in Australia's constitution is far weaker than its more famous American cousin, the First Amendment, also known as the right to free speech.\n\n\"A lot of Australians might think that we have something similar to a First Amendment,\" University of New South Wales associate professor Daniel Joyce said.\n\n\"But we don't have a bill of rights in our constitution.\n\n\"That's something that's been lamented by a lot of people.\"\n\nDaniel Joyce is from the University of New South Wales. (ABC News: Billy Cooper)\n\nIn order to succeed, a challenge on that basis will need to pass three key tests, according to Mr Mejia-Canales, starting with whether or not the law does in fact burden political communication.\n\n\"I would argue that it really clearly does,\" he said.\n\n\"It is a blanket ban on people under 16 from using social media \u2014 it actually just removes their ability to communicate about political matters across the board.\"\n\nThe second test is whether the law has a legitimate goal, which in this case is to keep young people safe from online harms.\n\n\"Which the Commonwealth has identified as including excessive screen time, social isolation, sleep interference, poor mental and physical health, and low life satisfaction,\" Professor Twomey said.\n\nAnne Twomey has raised concerns about the social media ban. (ABC News: David Sciasci)\n\n\"While a court would most likely accept that these are legitimate objects, it's much harder to tie them to what the law actually does.\"\n\nIn layman's terms, the third test is whether the law is proportionate to its purpose, and is seen as the most likely point of failure.\n\n\"That is, protecting young people from those harms in a way that has the least impact upon freedom of political communication,\" Professor Twomey said.\n\n\"This is where the trouble lies because there is such a disconnect between what the law is claimed to do and what it actually does.\"\n\nDr Joyce argued there were alternative approaches, such as the government's own proposal for a \"digital duty of care\", which would protect young people without blocking their access to online spaces.\n\n\"We don't know if the government has considered other, less intrusive ways of achieving the same outcome,\" Mr Mejia-Canales said.\n\nWhy we haven't seen a case in court yet?\n\nWhile experts agree there is a legitimate case to be heard about the ban's validity, there are many reasons why no such case has materialised.\n\n\"Having a constitutional case, particularly before the High Court, is expensive, time consuming \u2026 and incredibly stressful,\" Mr Mejia-Canales said.\n\n\"Particularly for any young people who might be a party to this case, and this is why I think we have not seen that challenge yet.\"\n\nDavid Mejia-Canales is a senior lawyer at the Human Right Law Centre. (ABC News: Billy Cooper)\n\nThere were also major administrative hurdles to consider, Dr Joyce said.\n\n\"It's quite a big endeavour,\" he said.\n\n\"In order to bring a constitutional case, you need to notify \u2026 all the attorneys-general in the states and territories and they might intervene.\"\n\nThe HRLC is considering a challenge of its own, but has not yet reached a point where it can proceed.\n\nHow will the social media ban work? Photo shows Graphic of child looking at a screen with the logos of all social media companies with squiggles in the background. The social media saga has produced its fair share of intrigue. But the latest big reveal on how the ban will work has left us with just another cliffhanger.\n\n\"At the moment, we're just working with others and taking instructions and, and speaking with [impacted] communities,\" Mr Mejia-Canales said.\n\nDespite its threats, Google is also yet to file a challenge and has not responded to media inquiries on the subject since July.\n\nMr Mejia-Canales said a challenge would become significantly more likely to emerge \"once all the moving parts of this legislation\" were actually in place.\n\n\"It's still a huge moving feast, which is why I'm not surprised that we haven't seen a challenge being mounted just yet,\" he said.\n\n\"But I wouldn't be surprised if one is already in the pipeline.\"\n\nYouTube may challenge its inclusion in the ban\n\nDocuments recently released under Freedom of Information laws reveal YouTube may yet try other legal avenues.\n\nIn its letter to Ms Wells in July, the platform repeated its claim that YouTube should be considered a video streaming platform, rather than social media, signalling it may challenge its inclusion in the ban on definitional grounds.\n\nWhat do you think about the social media ban for young people? Have Your Say. Photo shows Graphic of text bubbles with various comments around factors contributing to digital dilemma The ban on social media for under 16s is around the corner and could have wide-reaching impacts. Are you in favour? Will it work? Have Your Say.\n\nThe third legal option YouTube is considering is a challenge on the grounds of procedural fairness, arguing the government promised one thing, and delivered another, without a good enough reason.\n\n\"Given the legislation was passed on the express understanding that YouTube would be excluded, there is real doubt as to whether the removal of that exclusion is an appropriate exercise of the minister's power,\" the letter said.\n\nStaff from the Office of the eSafety Commissioner revealed in Senate estimates this week that Google and the regulator were still at 10 paces when it came to YouTube's inclusion, and neither was backing down.\n\n\"At this stage, Google and YouTube have conveyed to us that they don't consider that they're covered by the ban. We have a different view. We've advised them of that,\" eSafety head of enforcement Heidi Snell said on Wednesday.\n\nShe told the hearing Google was yet to say whether it would comply with the ban come December 10.\n\n\"That's probably a matter to wait and see closer to the time,\" Ms Snell said.\n\n\"If they choose to not comply then we will consider what next steps might be appropriate in terms of enforcing the legislation.\"\n\nIn developing the bill, the government did assess the impact on human rights, and determined the benefits would outweigh the negative impacts.\n\n\"Our world-leading social media laws are about protecting children from online harm, and giving them three more years to develop real-world connections and online resilience,\" the minister's office said in a statement.",

        "text": "A $40 million overcharging bungle by WA's largest energy retailer was a result of serious governance failures and other businesses may have also fallen foul, according to the state's economic watchdog.\n\nIt was revealed yesterday state-owned Synergy has taken $40 million from customers for non-existent bills since 2009.\n\nAccording to the company's CEO Kurt Baker, on many occasions this occurred because Synergy \"allowed customers to continue to pay to their closed account, even in the absence of a bill\".\n\nCustomers were debited for Synergy accounts that had already been closed. (ABC News: James Carmody)\n\nAlmost 175,000 customers were affected, with the overcharging ranging from less than a dollar, to tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe revelations come amid a review into Synergy after revelations from the Economic Regulation Authority of WA (ERAWA) the utility had overcharged disadvantaged customers $2.29 million over 15 years.\n\nERAWA chair Steve Edwell said payments were being automatically deducted from Centrelink payments from customers whose Synergy accounts were already closed.\n\nSteve Edwell is chair of Economic Regulation Authority of Western Australia. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\n\"We focused on the Centrepay cohort of customers because they were disadvantaged \u2014 the question on the table was the extent to which this is a broader issue,\" Mr Edwell told the ABC.\n\nMr Edwell said Synergy's $40 million bungle, affecting mostly residential customers, was the worst case of its kind he was aware of.\n\nAlmost 175,000 people were affected by the issue, dating back to 2009. (ABC News: Chris Gillette)\n\n\"There are around 13,000 accounts which have accrued in excess of $500, and there are 467 accounts which have accrued a credit balance in excess of $5,000,\" he said.\n\n'Very serious lapse'\n\nMr Baker said on Friday the company had been alerted by customers in the past of automatic payments being made to closed accounts, and those customers were refunded.\n\nMr Edwell said Synergy should have noticed those instances as red flags indicating there was a broader issue.\n\n\"That's why we have an issue with the governance around all this. We think there's been a very serious deficiency,\" Mr Edwell said.\n\nSynergy customers overcharged $40 million Photo shows A large illuminated Synergy sign on a wall. More than 170,000 customers have been overcharged a total of $40 million by WA's state-owned energy retailer Synergy since 2009, sparking an apology from its CEO.\n\n\" To be frank, it's a very, very serious lapse in Synergy governance. \"\n\nThe review into Synergy is part of a broader effort by the Economic Regulation Authority to understand the full extent of the issue across the industry.\n\nMr Edwell has flagged there are other businesses which have also overcharged customers in a similar fashion.\n\n\"It doesn't appear to be an endemic problem across the sector [but] that doesn't mean to say we won't be taking some form of action against some other retailers,\" he said.\n\nMr Edwell said he was unable to reveal details about the other businesses, or the full extent of the issue, until the review was complete.\n\nRefunds coming\n\nSynergy said on Friday it would contact all affected customers and issue cash refunds, or credit for future bills, but that process could take several months.\n\n\"On behalf of Synergy I'd like to say I'm sincerely sorry for the impact that we've had on our customers,\" Mr Baker said.\n\n\"I'm confident this will not happen again.\n\nKurt Baker says he's confident the issue won't be repeated. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\n\" We've done our own internal reviews, we've got the state government's independent review, we'll be taking our findings, the state government's findings, to improve our systems. \"\n\nMr Edwell said ERAWA had the ability to issue fines of \"over $100,000\" if businesses like Synergy failed to fix the issue.\n\n\"The penalty of that size is in nowhere near proportion to the damage that's done here,\" he said.\n\n\"The ERA is currently considering as part of this review, what we can say to Synergy, what we can say to government, about appropriate enforcement action.\"\n\nLoading...",

(ABC Illawarra: Brooke Chandler)\n\nThe permanent exhibit in Crown Street includes a rock playground with a swing, two palms lying on ground level and one up a pole.\n\nThe unusual move by business owners Ryan and Nikki Aitchison came after the council knocked back their development application (DA) to repurpose disused areas of the three-storey building.\n\nThe permanent exhibit includes a rock playground, two palms lying on ground level and one up a pole. (ABC Illawarra: Brooke Chandler)\n\n\"Back when we were friends with council, we liked the palm trees up-the-pole,\" Mr Aitchison said.\n\n\"But after how we've been treated \u2026 all I can do now is make as much noise as possible.\"\n\nSmall, potted palm trees were strung up on street poles outside the hotel. (ABC Illawarra: Brooke Chandler)\n\nSo, what did council say no to?\n\nIn May 2024, The Illawarra Hotel lodged a development application to turn the ground floor into a TAB area and replace dilapidated accommodation on the first and second floors with a kitchen, bar and bistro.\n\n\"In the centre of the hotel, we would have fully restored the original staircase \u2026 and then on the western side we'd have a ballroom with fixtures that were period specific,\" Mr Aitchison said.\n\nThe Illawarra Hotel wanted to build a 1930s-style ballroom. (Supplied: Ryan Aitchison)\n\nThe Wollongong couple, who bought the nearly 100-year-old premises in 2019, also wanted to install a rooftop bar above the ballroom, creating an open-air void between the second and third floors.\n\n\"It was something that would meet the needs of the community because there is a shortfall in rooms that can accommodate 100 to 400 guests,\" Mr Aitchison said.\n\nThe Illawarra Hotel in Wollongong's CBD is best known for its ornate architectural facade. (Supplied: Ryan Aitchison)\n\nThe desired renovations were due to cost about $6 million and would have followed on from major works completed to the ground floor in 2020.\n\n\"We felt we have more than proven to Wollongong that our heart was in the right place and we had chosen to be custodians of this building,\" Mr Aitchison said.\n\nHeritage, structure concerns\n\nWollongong City Council last month rejected the development application, citing concerns about how the structural engineering solutions would affect the building, which was heritage listed in the Wollongong Local Environment Plan 2009.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"We required the works done in a way people could still interpret the building's original lay-out, that didn't impact any retained heritage detailing, and [could be] reversed \u2026 [to] the building's original structure,\" the council said in a statement.\n\nIt said the \"overriding concern\" was the building's structural integrity through the creation of the void between the second and third floors.\n\n\" Council is open to considering alternative design approaches to the void area, which may address potential heritage impacts. \"\n\nAfter stringing up his palm trees, Mr Aitchison launched legal action against the council in the NSW Land and Environment Court.\n\n\"Council haven't engaged a structural engineer, nor have they asked us to engage a structural engineer,\" he said.\n\nWollongong City Council said in a statement \"it is the responsibility of the proponent to demonstrates that issues can be addressed.\"\n\nPassersby said The Illawarra Hotel's take on Wollongong's palm tree up a pole was entertaining. (ABC Illawarra: Brooke Chandler)\n\nWollongong heritage consultant Andrew Conacher said heritage decisions were complicated and he suspected the council wanted more of the original character of the building maintained.\n\n\"The DA [development application] has been with council for 18 months, and sooner or later they have to make a decision and put in as many reasons as possible,\" he said.\n\nMr Conacher said the DA lodged by The Illawarra Hotel respected the building's intended use.\n\n\" It's not as if you are putting something completely different into the building; you're putting something similar to its current use. \"",

        "text": "Laurie Burgess is not just any courier.\n\nAbout 20 years ago, he made the decision to move only art across the country.\n\nThe back of his van is packed with paintings, drawings, sculptures and ceramics which he ferries to galleries, buyers, and art competitions around Australia.\n\nHe clocks up 1 million kilometres every four years, working 16-hour days.\n\nAlong the way, he's developed an appreciation and knowledge of the Australian art world few could rival.\n\n\"This is not me blowing my own trumpet, but there is no one person that sees as many galleries as myself or as many artists as myself,\" Mr Burgess said.\n\nMr Burgess has travelled millions of kilometres in his trusty van. (ABC News: Jordan Young)\n\nIt means gallery owners and artists are often calling him wanting to know what's happening in the world of contemporary art.\n\n\"There's a lot of emotion in art. A lot of artists can be rather anxious at times and so you've got to sort of help them to keep their spirits up,\" Mr Burgess said.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, many feared art sales would dive.\n\n\" I said, 'Well, if people are going to sit there staring at the walls, maybe they're going to buy something to put on that wall', and as it turned out ... it was actually quite good. \"\n\nMr Burgess says the Covid19 pandemic was \"quite good\" for art sales. (ABC News: Jordan Young)\n\nOwner of Handmark Gallery in Hobart Allanah Dopson said it was essential for artists to be able to move their art across the country.\n\n\"It's really good for artists to enter interstate prizes and to get recognition and get their art out there. So, Laurie fills that void really well,\" she said.\n\n\" We are in awe of Laurie each time he comes and says, 'Oh, I've been across the Nullarbor' or, 'Yesterday I was in Sydney.' \"\n\nAllanah Dopson says artists often need works moved for interstate competitions. (ABC News: Jordan Young)\n\nSleeping in his van\n\nMr Burgess spends most of the year on the road driving between Perth and Hobart and up the east coast of Australia \u2014 as far north as Noosa \u2014 and back again.\n\nHe only takes time off during January and Easter.\n\nHe said while his lifestyle was \"not for everyone\", he was working hard to save enough money to buy a house and retire.\n\n\"It will be the first house I've ever bought, the only house I will ever buy,\" he said.\n\nMr Burgess has retrofitted his van with a sleeping area to save on hotel costs. (ABC News: Jordan Young)\n\nSaving for a home has come with some cost-cutting measures.\n\nHe's built a specially designed sleeping section in his van to save on staying at roadside motels.\n\n\"[I can] pull over, crawl into it, no time lost, no time wasted,\" he said.\n\nMr Burgess said a comfortable mattress, doonas and electric blankets were essential.\n\n\"[During winter] all I seem to be doing is driving around finding different places to freeze to death, such as out on the Nullarbor or Yass,\" he said.\n\nSome of Mr Burgess's delivery destinations. (ABC News: Magie Khameneh)\n\nArt appreciation\n\nMr Burgess's home ownership dream is taking longer to realise than he expected.\n\nNot only have house prices gone up, but his growing art collection is also getting in the way.\n\n\"I do end up buying a little bit [of art]. My accountant said to me I have to stop doing that or I will never have a house to hang them in,\" he said.\n\nMr Burgess has learnt a thing or two about art over the years. (ABC News: Jordan Young)\n\nMr Burgess said he never really knew much about art before he started moving it around the country.\n\nBut these days he knows what he likes.\n\n\"If I had to describe my taste, it's nickelodeon,\" he said.\n\nHandmark Gallery in Hobart is one of galleries Mr Burgess delivers to. (ABC News: Jordan Young)\n\n\"I'm all primary colours, bright colours, movement; and it can be glass, it can be ceramics, it can be paintings, pastels.\n\n\"I've even got a couple of little pencil drawings and some coloured pen drawings from an emerging artist in Robe, South Australia, which are perfect kitchen drawings.\"\n\nBut for now, Mr Burgess's collection is in storage until he is in a position to pull over for a while and take a break from delivering art.",

        "text": "The Tasmanian government has accused the owner of a manganese smelter in the state's north of failing to meet the conditions of a $20 million loan that was meant to ensure its ongoing supply of ore.\n\nLiberty Bell Bay is owned by GFG Alliance and is Australia's only manganese alloy smelter. It has been in limited operations since May, which has placed uncertainty over the future of around 250 jobs.\n\nGFG required a 23,000-tonne shipment of manganese ore in order to restart, and the state government provided the loan in August.\n\nThe shipment arrived last week, but operations are yet to restart.\n\nThe $20 million loan paid for one shipment of manganese ore. (ABC News: Emily JB Smith)\n\nIndustry and Resources Minister Felix Ellis said the loan came with \"clear, enforceable conditions\".\n\n\"We have formally written to the company putting them on notice that they have not met the conditions of the loan,\" he said.\n\n\"The state holds security over the asset but our confidence in GFG's ability to meet its obligations has been severely undermined by its failure to restart operations.\n\nTrump tariffs, ore price cited as smelter announces 'limited operations' Photo shows Unidentified workers wearing hard hats and overalls. One of the biggest industrial manufacturing employers in Tasmania's north says a lack of ore supply and US tariffs have played a part in a decision to pause smelter operations.\n\n\"We will not rule in or out any options that protect Tasmanian workers and the future of the Bell Bay operation.\"\n\nThe loan included a condition that GFG take all steps to resume production by the end of September.\n\nA Liberty Bell Bay spokesperson said the ore was being unloaded and preparatory work was underway.\n\nThe company blamed \"ongoing challenges with ore supply\" caused by a cyclone for the initial period of limited operations.\n\nIt now says a collapse in ferroalloy prices is affecting the restart.\n\nThe smelter, owned by GFG Alliance, employs about 250 full-time workers. (ABC News: Owain Stia-James)\n\n\"Given sudden changes in market conditions, it is now prudent for Liberty Bell Bay to first gain clarity on its supply position in the US market before commencing a restart of the smelter,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"High carbon ferro manganese prices have fallen over 13 per cent in the US since June, with 9 per cent in the last week alone.\n\nLocals fear for jobs after Liberty Bell Bay limits operations Photo shows Three individuals wearing casual outdoor clothing photographed from the shoulders up. Liberty Bell Bay employs more than 250 full-time workers, mostly from the George Town area. Locals say they are worried about the impact of job losses as the smelter announces it's limiting operations.\n\n\"A team from Liberty Bell Bay will be meeting customers in the United States next week to take stock of the situation and gain clarity.\"\n\nGFG Alliance has been contacted for comment regarding whether it has failed to meet the conditions of the government loan.\n\nThe $20 million loan was recommended by the Tasmanian Development Board, and was welcomed at the time by all sides of state politics as providing certainty to workers.\n\nGFG facing financial troubles across its companies\n\nGFG Alliance operations have faced crises in multiple states \u2014 most notably its former Whyalla site \u2014 and its Liberty Bell Bay manganese smelter is no different.\n\nThis week, the Whyalla Ports administrators' report stated that Liberty Bell Bay had a $121.4 million capital deficiency as of June 30, and was operating at a net loss of $80.3 million.\n\nIt confirmed the Tasmanian government loan has first ranking security of Liberty Bell Bay assets.\n\nIn addition to this loan, Liberty Bell Bay would require a further capital facility to continue operating, the administrators' report said.\n\nThe report notes that, if the smelter closes, there would be a rehabilitation claim of about $200 million.\n\nGFG moves $200 million out of Liberty Bell Bay\n\nThe Tasmanian government has received advice from Deloitte that points out Liberty Bell Bay would likely require either private or government capital assistance, and that it was unclear if GFG would be able to contribute.\n\nIt disputes that the smelter's issues are primarily due to ore supply problems or soft sales markets.\n\nInstead, it states that GFG has moved about $200 million out of Liberty Bell Bay to related parties via inter-company loans, and paid a cash dividend to the UK parent company in 2022.\n\nGFG faced similar claims in relation to its Tahmoor colliery in New South Wales.\n\nRoll-on effects significant for troubled smelter\n\nThe government estimates that Liberty Bell Bay provides a further 400 indirect jobs.\n\nThe Liberty Bell Bay smelter is a major employer near George Town, in the state's north. (ABC News: Kate Nickels)\n\nThis includes workers at the Beams Brothers quarry at Flowery Gully in the West Tamar, which provides the smelter with limestone, dolomite and iron ore.\n\nCompany head Donald Beams told ABC Radio Hobart that the smelter provides up to 40 per cent of the quarry's business.\n\nHe said he only found out that the smelter would not be immediately restarting via ABC news.\n\nBell Bay Advanced Manufacturing Zone chief executive officer Susie Bower said the restart would need to wait until after Liberty Bell Bay representatives had secured US customers.\n\n\"If that's not an opportunity, then they will need to pivot to look at other markets,\" she said.\n\n\"Can't say with any certainty whether that money will be returned. But this is what happens, again, in free trade, global markets.\"",

        "text": "\"Does fashion Twitter have a misogyny problem?\"\n\nHo-hum, another day, another \"woman\" problem: replace the word fashion in that sentence with anything else you can think of from the manosphere internet and we can have a nice long chat about it.\n\nThat was the headline from Elle Australia last year, when the snarking and sniping from young, male commentators about fashion labels led by women creatives was almost universally critical.\n\nThis Paris fashion week, which has just concluded, we can see exactly what that claim really meant.\n\nVirginie Viard, at Chanel, was described by her predecessor Karl Lagerfeld as \"my right hand and my left hand\". (Reuters: Sarah Meyssonnier)\n\nTikTok celebrates\n\nThose female directors who endured years of online undermining have now gone, replaced by men \u2014 very well-credentialed and well-regarded male designers, just as the women were. And wouldn't you know it? TikTok and Insta are now ecstatic at the change, at the new dawn, at the freshness and the vision and thank God for the change!\n\nThere was Virginie Viard at Chanel, described by her predecessor Karl Lagerfeld as \"my right hand and my left hand\", whose runways were decried by the Tokkers as \"uninspired, basic \u2026 out of touch with what luxury should be\".\n\nYou could set your watch by the pursed lips and screwed-up faces of the mini-mic clutching commentators. There wasn't a runway by Viard that they would leave unclawed.\n\nThe reality is that Viard led Chanel to significant growth, with revenue increasing by 75 per cent from 2018 to $US19.7 billion in 2023. But cowed by the commentary, Viard was replaced, her tenure at the helm, after 30 years at Chanel, now described by company president Bruno Pavlovsky as an \"intermission\".\n\nHer replacement was Matthieu Blazy. The commentators all exploded in raptures at his show this week.\n\nAt Dior the hatred for the designs of Maria Grazia Chiuri was shocking. (Reuters: Guglielmo Mangiapane)\n\nAll the key labels run by men\n\nAt Dior the hatred for the designs of Maria Grazia Chiuri, which included one the greatest wedding dresses of all time for Australian model, Miranda Kerr, was shocking. The vitriol bore no relationship to the fun, beauty and incredible craftsmanship of her pleated, embroidered and sometimes ethereal work.\n\nOne show was described by commentator @Ly.as as \"by far the worst\" he had ever seen at fashion week.\n\nUnder Chiuri, Dior's annual revenues increased substantially, with figures suggesting they grew from $3.5 billion to around $16 billion during her nearly nine years as creative director. She was replaced by Jonathan Anderson.\n\nAnd yes, all the commentators now love Dior.\n\nWomen were buying what these women designers were selling.\n\nBut just like that, there are now no longer any women designing haute couture \u2014 none. All the key labels are led by men. Of the other major fashion labels that show at Paris fashion week, most of them are led by male creatives; the ones that are led by women are almost exclusively eponymous labels such as Stella McCartney, Victoria Beckham or Miuccia Prada at Prada.\n\nSarah Burton, who many hoped might land Dior after her brilliant turn at Alexander McQueen following the designer's tragic death, is an exception. (Reuters: Neil Hall)\n\nThe exceptions to the rule\n\nSarah Burton, who many hoped might land at Dior after her brilliant turn at Alexander McQueen following the designer's tragic death, is an exception at Givenchy, as is Louise Trotter at Bottega Veneta. Who knows for how long. Keep an eye on the TikTokkers to track their fate.\n\nWhat came before the key changes at the top can't be ignored, because while the devil still might wear Prada, nobody pays much attention to what the magazines say anymore: all the true influence is online on social media, on incredibly popular accounts mostly run by young, male fashion-adjacent commentators with varying degrees of fashion education and experience.\n\nAnd yet to read their commentary, you'd think they'd trained at the hand of Cristobal Balenciaga himself. (One of them, @hautelemode, actually managed to kid himself that a second hand jacket he'd picked up was a Balenciaga original \"related to the Austro-Hungarian Empire\" because of the coat of arms printed on its buttons. I think any seamstress could have told him they were just the standard metal-shank crest buttons that are used on any old jacket. His turned out to be any old jacket.)\n\nThere's also a particularly bitchy energy to the commentary and worldview that as a female fashion lover I feel I have had to be very aware of lest I fulfil the stereotype male commentators and designers seem to want women to be.\n\nThese were the commentators whose relentless criticism led fashion doyenne Mimma Viglezio, a former executive at Vuitton and Bulgari, to call out the misogyny of \"male influencers who tear down successful female designers \u2026 it's disrespect dressed up as critique\". Her account is worth a follow.\n\nSign up for Weekend Reads in your inbox Photo shows Virginia Trioli in a stylish suit on a set with lighting behind her Start your weekend with the best of the ABC's journalism, presented by Virginia Trioli.

        "text": "Let\u2019s revert to this mooted R360 competition. Sooner, and not later, scores of rugby union and rugby league players in Australia and elsewhere will have serious career decisions to make, and their own Rubicons to cross. The gravitational pull of being paid in US dollars is attractive, even if the 45th /47th President of the United States is off the leash with such magnificence that he can shift the value of the greenback with an utterance. The idea that players might relocate their tax residency status to Dubai or somewhere else within the United Arab Emirates, to end up paying minimal or no tax, is another lever that\u2019ll be pulled. Payne Haas is on R360\u2019s radar. Credit: Getty Images And consider both those factors in the context of players being offered salaries that NRL clubs, Super Rugby franchises, and national unions can\u2019t hope to match. If Payne Haas wants $US5 million tax-free a season, then I kid you not, the R360 people will likely agree. In rugby league, Haas would be lucky to ever sign a contract for a third of that. In Australian dollars. And then he has to pay the Australian taxman a bit less than half of that.\n\nSo if you\u2019re a middling Super Rugby player, or a professional NRL player devoid of much prospect of joining the ranks of the game\u2019s elite within the next decade, what is actually restraining you, besides fear of the unknown? Sure, R360 could be a concept worth the value of a plastic toy at the bottom of a Corn Flakes box. But domiciling an NRL franchise smack bang in the middle of the capital city of a third-world country isn\u2019t without risk either. If I were acting for a player, free from existing contractual obligations forbidding negotiations and legally able to accept an offer to play in the R360 competition, I\u2019d demand a couple of showstoppers. First, a three-year contract, and not a day less.\n\nSecond, that the whole of the contracted salary amount, in US dollars, be put into a controlled monies account that can be operated only with the authority of the player, his agent and his employing franchise. Because that\u2019s the only way to ensure the whole of the agreed monies will definitely be there each payday in 2028. Loading Signing a long-term agreement with untried organisers promising untold fortunes could end up like winning a sweepstakes that promises a million bucks a year for the rest of your life, but the company files for bankruptcy 55 years before your projected life expectancy ends (as happened in the US this year, when Publishers Clearing House went bust. Google it). Third, I\u2019d demand a cast-iron tax indemnity, which operates so R360 must indemnify the player in all circumstances and for all taxation amounts payable, if it ever comes to pass that any part of the player\u2019s salary is subject to taxation in their usual place of residence, or elsewhere. Because tax laws can change. Fourth, I\u2019d insist that R360 takes out an insurance policy in my client\u2019s name, that guarantees payment of all my client\u2019s remuneration in the event the competition\u2019s fortunes and financial backers vanish.\n\nI\u2019ve acted for several professional coaches and players who\u2019ve taken the bait and shifted their whole lives to play or coach in the \u201csporting Meccas\u201d of Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Almost inevitably, they get stiffed financially sooner or later, forcing them to fight their employing clubs through FIFA\u2019s judicial systems. Loading I won all those cases and got them their money. But that\u2019s only because FIFA\u2019s rules permit transfer bans and other footballing sanctions to be imposed on the non-paying clubs if they stonewall. R360 isn\u2019t sanctioned by World Rugby; players and their agents won\u2019t really know who they\u2019re dealing with. Indeed, national unions, including Rugby Australia, have announced that R360 players will be banned from international and Olympic representation, which evinces the idea of the \u201cworld game\u201d cutting ties. Note for completeness, however, that the Australian Rugby League tried the same tactic with Super League defectors 30 years ago. The tactic failed, legally. None of this is hypothetical scaremongering.",

Source: Supplied / Tasmanian Government It was first detected on a farm in north-west Tasmania in July, also marking the first time it's been found in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting in Tasmania ahead of planting saw 1,700 tonnes of infected seed potatoes destroyed, with calls for a federal assistance package for affected farmers. Concerns also remain about how it got here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The most concerning thing about the mop top incursion into Tasmania is that this isn't just the first time the virus has been detected in Tasmania, but it's also the first time that it's been detected within Australia,\" TasFarmers CEO Nathan Calman said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Its presence here represents a failure of our national biosecurity protocols, but also our state biosecurity protocols.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry told SBS the current government has committed an extra $2 billion to resourcing the country's biosecurity system since it came to power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia has a world-leading national biosecurity system, which is critical to our economy, environment and way of life,\" they said.\n\n\n\nHow did it get here?\n\nEfforts so far to trace the source indicate PMTV could have been in Tasmania for two years.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's chief plant protection officer Gabrielle Vivian-Smith was questioned about the incursion by Tasmanian senator Richard Colebeck in estimates this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not known exactly how it arrived in Australia, it potentially could have come in on a number of different pathways,\" she said.\n\n\n\nStuart with his dog Ziggy in a field where he will plant his potatoes.

The couple owns an apartment in Brooklyn, they have two dogs and a wide network of close friends from musical theatre and the gym.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut she says the attitude towards foreign nationals under the current administration has made life in the US feel \"scary\". Kate says these fears were brought to the surface during her green card interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They grilled me in the interview and asked me questions not even related to our marriage but about my previous visa and time in the US,\" she says.\n\n\n\nAdvice on the Australian government's Smartraveller website advises that a valid visa does not guarantee entry to the US. Source: Getty / Alexander Spatari \"I was terrified I wouldn't be approved and every time I travel in and out of the country, there is fear of being deported. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nKate says her husband has taken to waiting nervously outside customs whenever she flies back into the US, as he is \"unsure if I'll get through or not\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSome foreign nationals in Kate's social circle have already left the US due to political concerns but she also acknowledges the ability to leave is a privilege.\n\n\n\nMost of my friends are local and worry for their futures, their kids' futures.\n\nWhile she says it might sound \"extreme\", Kate and her friends have all made contingency plans in case of any sudden changes to the political climate or their safety.\n\n\n\nLast month, US President Donald Trump's administration added a US$100,000 ($151,000) fee to the high-skilled worker visa known as the H-1B. Source: Getty / Alex Wong \"My friends and I talk about 'to go' bags. We have a safe spot at one of our gyms that we will meet at if cellular service goes down; we have cars ready to go,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The unexpected could happen at any time and with this government making irrational decisions at the drop of a hat, it wouldn't surprise me if we need to move quick and get out of the country.\"\n\n\n\n'Changes within days'\n\nMany Australians living in the US are reporting experiencing high levels of anxiety and feelings of instability due to the possibility of rapid political change under US President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Kate, others interviewed by SBS News declined to be identified due to concerns that they could be deported for speaking negatively about the US to foreign media.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 99,000 Australians live in the US, according to the most recent data from the United States Census Bureau.\n\n\n\n\n\nJosh Pugh, who runs the America Josh community for expats in the US, tells SBS News that while the first Trump administration held the same beliefs about limiting immigration, a sense of unease has grown in his community during Trump's second term about what the government is capable of doing \u2014 and how quickly.\n\n\n\n\"It feels like they've become more effective at executing what they want to do and that has meant more sweeping changes without checks and balances,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Changes aren't scheduled months in advance; they're scheduled to enact within days and hours.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLast month, the Trump administration added a US$100,000 ($151,000) fee to the high-skilled worker visa known as the H-1B .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe administration later clarified that it is intended as a one-time fee that will not apply to current visa-holders.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision dealt a heavy blow to the tech sector, which relies on skilled workers from China and India but Trump said the change should incentivise American companies to hire US workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile most Australians who apply to work in the US typically apply for an E-3 visa, which was introduced as part of a free trade agreement between the two countries in 2005, Pugh says the changes to the H-1B have heightened concerns about the E-3.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Trump authorises deployment of 300 national guard troops to Chicago\n\n\"The question I get asked the most is 'Do you think there will be changes to visas, like the E-3?', which is not something I have been asked in my almost nine years,\" Pugh says.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike Kate's friends, Pugh says he's seeing more people making contingency plans, asking one another what it would take to leave the US and how they would plan on doing it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In most issues, the community is resilient to change and will work through issues as they come, but we're seeing preparedness increasing and more plans being made for what to do if there are more changes to visa statuses or actions that personally impact them,\" he says.\n\n\n\nVisas no longer a guarantee for entry\n\nSydney-based Stacey Tsui, a partner of immigration at Vialto Partners, which helps skilled workers with international relocation, tells SBS News changes to the E-3 may not be likely but Australians should \"expect the unexpected\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If Australia can keep good diplomatic relations with the US \u2014 you know, because we're generally a good ally and it's a small visa program, hopefully it just flies under the radar,\" Tsui says.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, recent changes mean Australians on E3 visas may also have to return to Australia every two years to renew their visas, according to a recent directive made by the US state department.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those on H-1B visas, there has also been continued uncertainty around the freedom to travel outside US borders and return.\n\n\n\nWhile White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt has said current visa holders can leave and re-enter the country as normal, this has not quelled anxieties about the fee. Earlier this month, Microsoft sent an email to staff saying H-1B visa holders should not leave the country for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe likelihood of gaining entry with any visa has also been diminished and Australians have reported being turned away at the border despite holding valid documents.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvice on the Australian government's Smartraveller website advises that a valid visa does not guarantee entry to the US and \"US authorities have broad powers to decide if you're eligible to enter and may determine that you are inadmissible for any reason under US law\".\n\n\n\n\n\nUS resident Millie (not her real name) says the current scrutiny around visas is making her feel like a \"frog in warm water that is close to boiling\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally from Australia, Millie tells SBS News she moved to New York in 2016 with a former partner.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe lives in the US on an O-1B visa, which requires \"sustained acclaim in arts\" but she's worried about potential rapid changes or expenses that could be applied to that visa that could upend her life.\n\n\n\n\"If they raised the price of my visa to $100,000 like they did the H1-B, I would not be able to pay that,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Also, it's ridiculous and even if I could pay it, I wouldn't.\"\n\n\n\n'Saving money in case we need to flee'\n\nOther Australians living in the US report a growing fear of persecution.\n\n\n\n\n\nKarina (not her real name) has been living in the US for four years and lives with her partner in New York.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says that while recent changes to visas have caused a significant amount of anxiety \u2013 particularly while she was renewing her E3 in April this year \u2013 there are broader political changes that have caused her to consider leaving the country.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Hope and hate: how governments around the world are responding to 'illegal' immigration SBS News 17:52 English\n\nKarina's wife, whom she married last year, is trans and has had top surgery. Karina says she is \"terrified\" for her wife's safety in light of rhetoric that threatens LGBTQI+ rights in the US, as well as a number of executive orders signed by the president directing the government not to recognise transgender or nonbinary identities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Heritage Foundation, one of the US' most influential conservative policy groups and publisher of a set of ultra-conservative policy proposals known as Project 2025 (and its offshoot the Oversight Project) have pushed for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to designate \"Transgender Ideology-Inspired Violent Extremism\" as a domestic threat category.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US Supreme Court is also currently weighing up whether to take on a case that could potentially overturn the landmark ruling Obergefell v Hodges that extended marriage rights to same-sex couples.\n\n\n\n\n\nKarina says she is constantly finding herself \"glued to politics\" and that these political shifts have made her and her wife reconsider their life in the US, despite significant ties to their large friendship group and family close by in New York state.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As a queer immigrant, it is hard to feel like the country wants you to stay,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\"We have been saving our money in case we need to change our plans and flee quickly.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile she sees a lot of anxiety in her community, Karina says many of her friends are American and the decision to leave is more complicated for them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of them are politically motivated and attend protests,\" she says.\n\n\n\nHowever, I personally do not feel safe to do so.\n\nThose who have already left\n\nClaire (not her real name), 36, says she anticipated the issues that would arise with visas and immigration and decided to leave the night of the US election in November.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe was working for a humanitarian organisation in Washington DC and had been based in the US since 2021 but decided to leave after Trump was re-elected.\n\n\n\n\"Every month since has confirmed it was the right decision,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My E3 [visa] was set to expire in September 2025 and so I would have had to renew or reapply. I was worried that because of my work and advocacy on humanitarian issues, it would get denied and I wouldn't be able to re-enter the US.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nClaire says she had an established life in the US, including an American partner, a cat, and a large community of friends but she felt she was given no choice but to leave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I didn't want access to my life to be down to the whims of a border officer every time I had to travel for work \u2014 which includes to places like Iraq and Sudan, which would not be looked at kindly,\" she says.\n\n\n\nNow living in Geneva, Claire says she is in a challenging situation with her partner, who has remained in the US and works in medicine. To join her and practice in Switzerland, he would need to attain EU qualifications.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile she says she enjoys parts of the US, the \"lack of clarity\" about her future there as a foreign worker has made her resolute that she does not want to return in the immediate future.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deployment of the National Guard to Washington DC in August made Claire even more confident in her decision to leave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The rise of hateful rhetoric, and actions from political leaders, and the suspension of basic legal norms doesn't make it a place I wanted to spend more time and energy investing in.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The pub might be losing its pull \u2014 at least for younger Australians .\n\n\n\n\n\nA new study has found gen Z is turning away from alcohol far more than older generations, a trend that could bring major public health gains and signal a shift in the nation's \"deeply embedded\" drinking culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research from Flinders University analysed 23 years of data to track and model drinking habits across five generational groups: the silent generation, baby boomers, gen X, millennials, and gen Z.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model found gen Z were 18 times more likely to abstain from drinking alcohol compared to baby boomers over the course of their lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nGen Z Australians were also found to be consuming significantly less alcohol per week than older generations.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Lead author Gianluca Di Censo, a research fellow at the National Centre for Education and Training on Addiction (NCETA), told SBS News the first-of-its-kind study in Australia also assessed whether the trend would have a lasting impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a really good sign because it's showing that it's not just in a certain period of time they're drinking less, it's likely that it's going to persist across their whole lives,\" he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE From cheers to fears: This is what happens to your body when you have a hangover\n\nMillennials are also drinking less than the generations before them, and along with gen Z, are projected to abstain from drinking at much higher rates throughout their lives than the two oldest generations.\n\n\n\n\n\nDi Censo said things could change, and future societal or economic developments could throw the model off course \u2014 but for now, \"it does seem like this is a permanent shift\".\n\n\n\nWhat's driving young people away from drinking?\n\nWhile the study doesn't determine that, researchers suspect a number of factors are shaping this pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese factors include the high cost of living, increased use of digital devices, rising consumption of health-related media, and a \"cultural shift towards denormalising alcohol consumption\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Gen Z feel as though they can go out and not drink and not seem like an outcast. There's also a normalisation of abstention and also a prioritisation of health and wellness,\" Di Censo said.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Michael Livingston is an associate professor of alcohol research at Curtin University's National Drug Research Institute.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe told SBS News there's a \"complex social pattern\" at play, including a \"fundamental shift\" in how young people interact, given how they spend so much time online, changes in parenting and more awareness of the health risks around alcohol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Young people are much more risk-averse now than they were 20 years ago,\" he said, pointing to research in other fields that shows declines in other risk-seeking acts among teens, such as those linked to road accidents, sexual behaviour and crime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those risk-taking behaviours that used to be kind of a fundamental part of that transition into adulthood, they're not as prominent as they were.\"\n\n\n\nOther studies have found young people are more likely to have existential worries about the future, including climate anxiety and financial concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile a reduction in drinking is a public health win, Livingston said there are concerns that mental ill-health and anxiety are also on the rise in younger groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the reasons people are drinking less is because they're worrying more, and that's obviously not a good outcome,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe implications of a cultural shift\n\nThe study's co-author, Kirrily Thompson from NCETA, said: \"For decades, alcohol has been deeply embedded in social life, but that's changing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Younger Australians are redefining what it means to socialise and celebrate, and they're doing it with less alcohol,\" she said. \"That's something we should be paying attention to, not just as researchers, but as a society.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlcohol consumption is linked to a variety of health issues, including multiple forms of cancer, liver and heart disease. According to estimates from the World Health Organization, alcohol consumption contributed to around 2.6 million deaths globally in 2019.\n\n\n\nThe study's authors believe understanding the drivers of generational trends could help inform public health strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey suggest policies such as minimum alcohol pricing, tighter restrictions on advertising, and targeted health campaigns could help support the downward trend.\n\n\n\nIs this happening anywhere else?\n\nChanging habits around drinking among Australians have been well documented.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in 2001, 70 per cent of young people in Australia, aged between 14 and 17, said they had consumed alcohol in the past 12 months, according to the National Drug Strategy Household Survey. But that figure has dropped to about 30 per cent in recent years.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News A similar trend exists across a number of high-income countries, including New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and European countries like Sweden.\n\n\n\n\n\nLivingston said it's a common pattern across many countries, \"with similar historic drinking cultures\" to Australia.\n\n\n\nWill the trend last?\n\nIt's not clear whether the trend is here to stay, but researchers said they're optimistic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're not very good at knowing what's going to happen in these big social changes in the future,\" Livingston said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think certainly for this generation, the people in their 20s now, that cohort, will drink less through their life course than previous cohorts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But whether we continue to drive down teen drinking in the future is a mystery that we'll have to keep tracking.\"\n\n\n\n",

A central one these aims is to return the hostages - all the hostages, the living and dead. And we are about to achieve that goal. We couldn't achieve it, without the extraordinary help of President Trump and the team: Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian activists who were detained and deported by Israel have spoken about the conditions they experienced in detention.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven Australians were part of the Gaza-bound aid flotilla [[the Global Sumud Flotilla]] that was intercepted by Israel's military in international waters last week.\n\n\n\n\n\nArriving in Sydney, after being deported to Jordan, Juliet Lamont says the conditions they faced included: being kicked, punched, spat at; while also being denied access to clean drinking water and menstrual pads.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says it has been concerning to experience - and see firsthand - the conditions, detainees are being subjected to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are 400 Palestinian children in jail at the moment, and in the prison that we will put in, in Ketziot, we could hear them crying at night as big Alsatian dogs were taken into those prison cells. These people wear, you know, semi-automatic machine guns, and they train their lasers on every one of our heads.

        "text": "Independent senator David Pocock won't re-join a parliamentary sports club even after a repentant organiser invited him back after a spat over a gambling lobby sponsor.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe unlikely Canberra brouhaha on the social pick-up matches spiralled in intensity on Friday, even dragging in Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbanese serves as the president of the Australian Parliament Sports Club, which hosts friendly games between MPs, their staff and journalists during parliamentary sitting weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nPocock was an enthusiastic participant until he realised the group accepted funding from Responsible Wagering Australia, a peak group for gambling companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe former Wallabies captain, who said he was \"shocked to learn that the club was selling access to parliamentarians\", queried a $2,500 sponsorship before being booted by club chief executive Andy Turnbull.\n\n\n\n\"Being kicked out of the club for raising concerns around gambling lobbyists buying access to the club shows the influence vested interests have here in parliament,\" the ACT senator said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 37-year-old has campaigned against gambling ties to sport and is critical of the federal government's failure to respond to a landmark inquiry that recommended banning online betting advertising.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent MP Allegra Spender called the banning of Pocock \"an absolute disgrace\" and resigned her membership, with Sophie Scamps, another crossbench MP, reportedly joining her.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked his opinion, Albanese told Nine newspapers he was \"not wasting any time on this issue\" but \"participation should be open to everyone\".\n\n\n\nAfter the prime minister weighed in, Turnbull opened his arms to Pocock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the PM says Dave Pocock should be reinstated, who am I to argue,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Pocock declined the invitation, which was delivered to the media, and not to him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even if the club reversed their decision, I wouldn't be rejoining the Parliamentary sports club unless they undertook a transparent, open process to consider the appropriateness of all current and future sponsorships,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe episode has shed light on one of the lesser-known ways groups can attempt to influence politicians \u2014 though Turnbull denies lobbying or wrongdoing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe club was on as a lobby register, but Turnbull said that was to be \"on the safe side\" and, following advice from the Attorney-General's department, he would seek to remove its listing.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurnbull had told the department the organisation had \"never been paid to make representations to government on behalf of others\".\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Fears new breed of influencers could worsen a $25 billion Australian problem\n\nSponsors include alcohol, pharmaceutical and financial companies and have been listed in the club newsletter since at least 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nPocock said he had not read the newsletter and wasn't aware when signing up.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe took issue with the offer to deregister, saying it should be listed \"if there are paying corporate members who interact with parliamentarians\".\n\n\n\n\n\nTurnbull said he had no problem accepting gambling sponsors because the club had \"taken the view that it must be agnostic with respect to its corporate members\".\n\n\n\n'You left me with no choice'\n\nTurnbull fumed at Pocock on Thursday evening in a message, saying the Senator had \"become the first person ever to politicise the most apolitical operation in the parliament\" after the ACT representative raised the issue at a parliamentary hearing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have, for the last 24 hours, just scratched my head in disbelief. It is inappropriate for you to remain a member of the club in these circumstances,\" he wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You chose a cheap shot that will have no effect on the outcome of your anti-gambling campaign.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am sorry it has reached this point but you left me with no choice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRWA chief executive Kai Cantwell said the group had complied with all disclosure and transparency requirements and parliamentary sports had never been about lobbying, which was done via proper channels and not on the field.\n\n\n\n",

Sooner, and not later, scores of rugby union and rugby league players in Australia and elsewhere will have serious career decisions to make, and their own Rubicons to cross. The gravitational pull of being paid in US dollars is attractive, even if the 45th /47th President of the United States is off the leash with such magnificence that he can shift the value of the greenback with an utterance. The idea that players might relocate their tax residency status to Dubai or somewhere else within the United Arab Emirates, to end up paying minimal or no tax, is another lever that\u2019ll be pulled. Payne Haas is on R360\u2019s radar. Credit: Getty Images And consider both those factors in the context of players being offered salaries that NRL clubs, Super Rugby franchises, and national unions can\u2019t hope to match. If Payne Haas wants $US5 million tax-free a season, then I kid you not, the R360 people will likely agree. In rugby league, Haas would be lucky to ever sign a contract for a third of that. In Australian dollars. And then he has to pay the Australian taxman a bit less than half of that.\n\nSo if you\u2019re a middling Super Rugby player, or a professional NRL player devoid of much prospect of joining the ranks of the game\u2019s elite within the next decade, what is actually restraining you, besides fear of the unknown? Sure, R360 could be a concept worth the value of a plastic toy at the bottom of a Corn Flakes box. But domiciling an NRL franchise smack bang in the middle of the capital city of a third-world country isn\u2019t without risk either. If I were acting for a player, free from existing contractual obligations forbidding negotiations and legally able to accept an offer to play in the R360 competition, I\u2019d demand a couple of showstoppers. First, a three-year contract, and not a day less.\n\nSecond, that the whole of the contracted salary amount, in US dollars, be put into a controlled monies account that can be operated only with the authority of the player, his agent and his employing franchise. Because that\u2019s the only way to ensure the whole of the agreed monies will definitely be there each payday in 2028. Loading Signing a long-term agreement with untried organisers promising untold fortunes could end up like winning a sweepstakes that promises a million bucks a year for the rest of your life, but the company files for bankruptcy 55 years before your projected life expectancy ends (as happened in the US this year, when Publishers Clearing House went bust. Google it). Third, I\u2019d demand a cast-iron tax indemnity, which operates so R360 must indemnify the player in all circumstances and for all taxation amounts payable, if it ever comes to pass that any part of the player\u2019s salary is subject to taxation in their usual place of residence, or elsewhere. Because tax laws can change. Fourth, I\u2019d insist that R360 takes out an insurance policy in my client\u2019s name, that guarantees payment of all my client\u2019s remuneration in the event the competition\u2019s fortunes and financial backers vanish.\n\nI\u2019ve acted for several professional coaches and players who\u2019ve taken the bait and shifted their whole lives to play or coach in the \u201csporting Meccas\u201d of Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Almost inevitably, they get stiffed financially sooner or later, forcing them to fight their employing clubs through FIFA\u2019s judicial systems. Loading I won all those cases and got them their money. But that\u2019s only because FIFA\u2019s rules permit transfer bans and other footballing sanctions to be imposed on the non-paying clubs if they stonewall. R360 isn\u2019t sanctioned by World Rugby; players and their agents won\u2019t really know who they\u2019re dealing with. Indeed, national unions, including Rugby Australia, have announced that R360 players will be banned from international and Olympic representation, which evinces the idea of the \u201cworld game\u201d cutting ties. Note for completeness, however, that the Australian Rugby League tried the same tactic with Super League defectors 30 years ago. The tactic failed, legally. None of this is hypothetical scaremongering.",

        "text": "A former AFL player will spend at least eight years behind bars after his life spiralled into a deadly drug addiction that eventually claimed the lives of two women in a meth-fuelled car crash.\n\nShannon John Cox, 39, played with South Fremantle in the West Australia Football League (WAFL) before he was drafted to Collingwood in the AFL in 2006.\n\nCollingwood described Cox as a defender at first who showed positive signs as a winger and lead-up half-forward. He played 25 games with the club before he lost his place in 2009.\n\nFormer Collingwood player Shannon Cox will spend at least eight years behind bars for the manslaughter of two women who were killed in a meth-fuelled car crash.\n\nCox had a troubled upbringing and began using alcohol and drugs at just 13 years of age.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cHe was bagging up drugs before he was taught how to ride a bike, it was a lonely and violent environment he was in,\u201d his lawyer Paul Holmes told the WA Supreme Court on Wednesday.\n\nMr Holmes said his client left high school in year 9 and learnt to read when he played with Collingwood, but six years after his AFL career, Cox eventually succumbed to drug addiction and spent time in prison for drug offences.\n\n\u201cSport took him away from addiction. When he played at a high level he wasn\u2019t using because of drug tests and scrutiny. When that went away he went straight back to drugs,\u201d Mr Holmes said.\n\nCox was on a community-based order for drug-related offences when he made a fatal decision to drive 414km from Geraldton to Perth with his 12-year-old daughter to collect his wife from prison on June 7, 2024.\n\nCox had consumed meth in the days before and was sleep-deprived when he fell asleep behind the wheel of his Toyota Prado. Picture: 7News\n\nHe had consumed meth in the days before and was sleep-deprived when he fell asleep behind the wheel of his Toyota Prado on the Brand Highway near Cooljarloo about 8.55am that morning.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nChristian Owens was driving a prime mover and towing a trailer north when he saw Cox cross to the wrong side of the road into his path.\n\nMr Owens moved his truck to avoid colliding with Cox, but the Prado hit the side of his trailer, spun and then crashed head on into a Suzuki Ignis that was travelling north behind the truck.\n\nTwo women aged in their 80s were inside the vehicle on their way to a CWA Choir and Drama Festival at Badgingarra, just 40km from where the collision occurred.\n\nCoral Senior and Thelma Clausen were lifelong friends. Picture: 9 News\n\nCoral Senior, 83, and Thelma Clausen, 82, had been lifelong friends for 60 years and were life members of the CWA for more than five decades when Cox struck their car in his Prado.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe two women survived the impact but suffered significant injuries and deteriorated quickly, both dying at the scene.\n\nCox was taken to hospital for mandatory drug testing that revealed he had 0.77mg of methamphetamine and amphetamine in his system and had showed signs of someone who was sleep-deprived.\n\nWhile he was out on bail facing charges over the crash, he failed a drug test and was jailed while he awaited sentencing.\n\nHis lawyer said Cox\u2019s drug addiction was so great that he breached his bail conditions, which was in contrast to wanting to reunite his family, the reason behind the fateful trip.\n\nDefence lawyer Paul Holmes told the court that Cox had a troubled upbringing and began using alcohol and drugs at 13. Picture: NewsWire/ Emma Kirk\n\nState prosecutor Michael Cvetkoski said Cox should not have been behind wheel and his decision changed the course of many lives.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cHe chose to drive when he was severely intoxicated on meth. In that state, he was a significant danger to himself, his daughter and other road users on the Brand Highway,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAn expert indicated a degree of meth intoxication rendered him incapable of operating a motor vehicle.\n\n\u201cIt is unsurprising he lost control of vehicle in the way he did and caused catastrophic events.\n\n\u201cHe was meant to be in the community doing the right thing and complying with conditions placed upon him. Instead, he decided to use drugs and drive on the road, taking two lives.\u201d\n\nLeanne Clausen and Suzanne Senior pushed for a change in the law on driving with drugs in your system after their mothers were killed. Picture: NewsWire/ Emma Kirk\n\nJustice Stephen Lemonis said during sentencing that drugs had been a prevailing factor in Cox\u2019s life since 2016 and the fatal crash came about because of his meth addiction.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cYou had a significant concentration of meth in your blood, you had taken a significant amount that rendered you incapable of being in control and had a lack of sleep,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou posed a significant danger to yourself, other road users and your own daughter that eventuated into a tragic accident.\u201d\n\nCox pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawfully killing another under such circumstances as not to constitute murder in the WA Supreme Court on Wednesday.\n\nHe was sentenced to 10 years and six months behind bars but will be eligible for parole after serving eight years and six months over the fatal crash.\n\nHis driver\u2019s licence was also be suspended for four years from his prison release date.",
