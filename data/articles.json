Do something special for him. The Brits gave him this huge state dinner and the King was there. He loves royalty. He loves being treated like that.\n\n\"I wish we had a president who understood that regardless of which leader is in power our allies are our allies for reasons that go beyond that.\n\n\"Even though you have a left-wing prime minister it should not inhibit a positive relationship with the United States but unfortunately it does.\"\n\nAnthony Albanese will need a game plan before he faces Donald Trump, an expert commentator says. (Getty)\n\nAnthony Albanese clearly gives some thought to managing these leaders.\n\nHe turned up at 10 Downing Street with a four-pack of Albo Ale as a gift.\n\nLet's hope Kevin Rudd and the diplomatic team don't let that happen at the White House.\n\nTrump doesn't drink.\n\nHe lost his brother to alcohol addiction and won't go near it.\n\nRegardless of the gift, it's a crucial meeting with so much uncertainty about relations between the two countries: tariffs, the submarine deal, the defence alliance, and Chinese expansion all need to be discussed.\n\nThey are due to meet on October 20.\n\nIt has taken too long to organise, which shows where Australia sits on the US agenda.\n\nBut the game has changed in many ways for a nation we still see as our defender.\n\nKirchick spoke on my podcast, Neil Mitchell Asks Why.\n\n\"Democratic allies need to understand that simply being a liberal democracy, which used to mean you were an ally because you had the same values, doesn't mean anything anymore.\n\n\"The Trump administration doesn't care about those airy fairy romantic things like democracy and liberal values and historical ties.\n\n\"The don't care about that. They care about, 'Let's make a deal. What's good for us?'\"\n\nJames Kirchick is a journalist, author and commentator. (James Kirchick)\n\nBefore he's branded as a left-wing part of the \"fake news\" conspiracy, it must be said Kirchick is seen in the US as a conservative commentator, although he admits voting Democrat recently.\n\nHe loathes Nazis and what they stand for but says they have the right to march in the streets.\n\nHe is critical of immigration levels.\n\nAnd he says the people must be armed in case they need to protect themselves from a \"tyrannical and authoritarian\" government.\n\nBut back to Trump management.\n\nKirchick says:\n\nHe is hugely inconsistent. After there was political violence, he said the country must come together, then soon after called for the destruction of the left.\n\nHe primarily believes in himself.\n\nHe has a deep need for approval.\n\nHe is contradictory \u2013 he admires strength but seeks subservience.\n\nHe wants to be remembered for \"making America strong\" and respected.\n\nAnd China, which is expanding in the Pacific, lustfully eyeing Taiwan and both duchessing and spying on Australia.\n\nWill the US step in if needed?\n\nKIRCHICK: \"Well, he responds to strength in the way that, if you saw the Israeli attack on the Iranian nuclear sites, which was successful in its initial stage, and then he decided, all right, I want to be a part of this. I want to be able to claim credit for it.\n\n\"So if you're ever in some kind of spat with the Chinese in the Pacific, you better damn make sure you're doing well.\n\n\"If you're not doing well, then he's not going to come in and save you. I mean, he's just not.\n\nMITCHELL: Really? That's frightening to Australia. It is frightening.\n\nKIRCHICK: Look, I was maybe being a little facetious. I would hope in a situation like that, that Donald Trump has people around him, who would be telling him, 'Mr President, it's very important for the United States that we support our allies in this situation. It's good for us. It'll make us look strong. It'll make us respected. And it'll send a message to the Chinese. Don't f--- with us.'\"\n\nSo are the tantrums and absurdly extreme statements tactical or genuine? What do we believe?\n\n\"He's a salesman and he always has been. If you look at where his money came from, it's from selling things.\n\n\"Like many salesmen, he makes big, grand promises. That's just part of his nature, that's part of his personality.\n\n\"And I do think to some extent in his negotiating strategy and he's very open about this, he puts it on the table and his opening offer will be something outrageous, you know, just something totally outrageous.\"\n\nFinally, although it makes the left shudder, does he really want the Nobel Peace Prize?\n\n\"I think he absolutely wants it. He's been saying for a long time that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\"And by the way, I would say he deserves it a lot more than Barack Obama did.\n\n\"Barack Obama got it eight months into his presidency.\n\n\"He didn't do anything.\"",

We need to ask, how do we get better outcomes here?\",\" she said.\n\n\"Let's use this as an opportunity to work with those families, but also with the NT government, so that we can turn around these really bad outcomes that we have in our school system.\"\n\nMs Scrymgour said the Commonwealth had the final say on whether an individual was involuntarily placed on income management.",

        "text": "Loneliness is rising fastest among Canberrans in their 30s and 40s, with new research showing this cohort is now more likely than younger people to report feeling lonely.\n\n\n\nThe University of Canberra's latest Living Well in the ACT Region report, released this week by the Health Research Institute, found that one in five respondents \u2014 or 18.8 per cent \u2014 aged 30 to 49 reported feeling lonely \"often\" or \"always\".\n\nThe result marks a shift from last year, when 18 to 29 year olds reported the highest rates of loneliness in the ACT.\n\n\n\nDrawn from a survey of more than 3,100 ACT residents conducted in late 2024, the findings also point to a broader decline in wellbeing across the population.\n\nAbout 31.2 per cent of all respondents reported low levels of wellbeing \u2014 the highest since the survey began in 2019 \u2014 echoing trends seen in national wellbeing and happiness data.\n\nUniversity of Canberra Associate Professor Jacki Schirmer says the rise in the cost of living led to the shift. (ABC News: Mark Moore)\n\nLead researcher Associate Professor Jacki Schirmer said financial pressure and time scarcity were compounding social disconnection.\n\n\"Particularly people aged 30 to 49 \u2014 you've got kids at home, they might have a big mortgage,\" Associate Professor Schirmer said.\n\n\" We're seeing a lot of stress in that group that wasn't there a few years ago. \"\n\nAssociate Professor Schirmer said the cost-of-living crisis was impacting people's social expenditure.\n\n\"A bit over two in five Canberrans said they've cancelled one or more social events in the last year because they were struggling financially. So they couldn't afford the coffee at the cafe, the restaurant dinner or to bring something to the BBQ,\" she said.\n\n\"These things are really intersecting. We already had some challenges with social connection, and it's become bigger as people struggle financially and experience those cost-of-living pressures.\"\n\nCommunity connection rebounds \u2014 for some\n\nDespite worsening loneliness for midlife adults, the report found that community participation had improved overall.\n\nThe share of ACT residents regularly taking part in community activities rose to 66.4 per cent by the end of 2024 from 55 per cent in early 2023.\n\nIn Canberra, community-led organisations were helping drive that shift.\n\n\n\nFormer Brumbies and Wallabies player Ben Alexander co-founded Running for Resilience nearly six years ago with Matthew Breen, after being approached by the young Brumbies fan to host a social run. Mr Breen had recently lost his father to suicide and his mother had just received a cancer diagnosis.\n\n\"We thought this was just a one-off run to try and get people active,\" Alexander said.\n\n\" But over the years, we've realised social connection is probably almost more important for mental health than exercise, which was a huge shock to me and made me realise I was incredibly lonely in the years after retiring. \"\n\nBen Alexander says he has realised the importance of social connection in recent years. (Hannah Johnston)\n\nWhat began as a small run followed by a free beer at The Dock in Kingston, has since developed into a registered charity that now hosts up to 16 weekly events across Canberra, including running, walking, yoga, and pickleball sessions.\n\n\"People come to get fit, but they stay for the connection,\" Alexander said.\n\n\"We're really trying to make it so easy for anyone to rock up, do some exercise, and have a chat with someone and make a friend.\"\n\nChoir offers connection through music\n\nIn north Canberra, another group finding strength in shared connection is the LGBTQIA+ community choir QWire.\n\nConvenor Erin Pynor said membership had grown from fewer than 100 to about 150 singers in the two years since she joined, with many new members aged 30 to 49.\n\n\"We're seeing people use [QWire] as a way to meet others \u2014 some are into music, some just love the queerness, the community, the connection they're getting here,\" they said.\n\nErin Pynor has found a sense of community by singing with Canberra Qwire.\n\nThe choir rehearses weekly in Lyneham and performs regularly at community events and concerts.\n\n\"I fit firmly into the [30\u201349] cohort myself and joined [QWire] to find community when I moved back to Canberra after a period away,\" Erin Pynor said.\n\n\"It really was just like a life-transforming kind of thing.\n\n\" I now have someone who sells eggs and I get them every week, someone else nearby who I carpool with, and another who has small children \u2014 we have play dates and things like that. \"\n\nOver-65s 'doing pretty well'\n\nThe survey shows that while loneliness remains a concern for many Canberrans, older adults, particularly those aged 65 and higher, are reporting notably high levels of wellbeing.\n\n\"They're doing pretty well,\" Associate Professor Schirmer said.\n\n\"Even some of the groups that typically have very high wellbeing saw a little bit of a loss, but that 65-and-over demographic \u2014 if you're in a good relationship and own your home \u2014 then you've got a much higher likelihood of having good levels of wellbeing than a lot of other groups.\"",

(ABC Rural: Matt Brann)\n\nBut not everyone agreed with that vision, even within government.\n\nIn 2014, then-agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce dismissed the idea that Australia could feed Asia's growing population.\n\n\"We only produce about one per cent of the agricultural product of the world and to start saying that this country \u2026 is going to be a predominant player on the global stage is not correct,\" he told ABC News Breakfast at the time.\n\n\"We couldn't even feed half of Indonesia \u2026 stop talking about 'we're going to feed the whole of Asia.'\"\n\nFormer agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce talked down claims Australia could 'feed the whole of Asia'.

(ABC Kimberley: Alys Marshall)\n\nDr Dale said the region had a crucial role to play, particularly as southern Australia faced increased drought risk.\n\n\"We know we're going to have greater drought risk in the south, and if northern Australia gets its agricultural development right, then it actually becomes extremely important for Australia's overall climate resilience,\" he said.\n\nDr Dale emphasised the need for strong collaboration across governments, industries, communities, and traditional owners to realise the region's potential.",

        "text": "LeBron James has once again got the eyes of the NBA world on him, and he did it with a 10-second clip on social media.\n\nHeading into his 23rd NBA season, James posted to his accounts a mysterious video of himself walking to a chair across from an unknown interviewer in the middle of a basketball court.\n\nThe video is accompanied by the phrase \"The decision of all decisions\", with the full reveal apparently set for 1am Wednesday AEDT.\n\nNaturally, speculation immediately began that it was a retirement announcement.\n\nJames will turn 41 on December 30, two months into the 2025/26 season, when he will play his second season alongside son Bronny with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nWhen he turns out for his first game, presumably in the Lakers' season opener against Golden State on October 22, he will break the record for the most seasons played in the NBA.\n\nIf he plays 50 games he will pass former Chicago and Boston centre Robert Parrish for the most games played in the league.\n\nSo a retirement announcement would not be unreasonable and would afford him a season-long farewell tour.\n\nThe title card of \"The Second Decision\" is an allusion to his infamous 2010 special The Decision, when he stunned the league with a free-agency move from Cleveland to the Miami Heat, where he formed a big three with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh to ultimately win two title championships.\n\nHe even appears to be wearing a similar checked shirt in both shoots.\n\nThe Decision sparked criticism of LeBron James and turned public opinion against him. (Larry Busacca: Getty Images)\n\nBut part of what made that moment in NBA history so shocking was the surprise.\n\nAlmost no-one knew exactly what was happening until James sat down with Jim Gray on a court at the Boys and Girls Club in Greenwich, Connecticut and the special aired on ESPN.\n\nIt was perhaps the first major scandal of James's career after being drafted by the Cavaliers straight out of high school in 2003, with the NBA superstar criticised for drawing out the announcement that he would \"take [his] talents to South Beach\" until half an hour into the program.\n\nLeBron and Bronny share NBA court Photo shows LeBron James and Bronny James walk onto the court together in an LA Lakers NBA game. LeBron James and Bronny James check into the Lakers' season opener together, becoming the first father-son duo to play together in an NBA game.\n\nIt stunned the Cavaliers and the rest of the NBA, which is why the tease this time has raised some eyebrows.\n\nJames is a savvy operator, with a production company of his own and any number of business interests and endorsements.\n\nOne of those, Uninterrupted, replied to the video on Instagram with: \"All eyes on this moment.\"\n\nThe interviewer in the clip does not appear to be a well-known personality and it would be bold for James, who worked so hard to rehabilitate his reputation after the first Decision, to hearken back to it in announcing the end of his career 15 years later.\n\nThat prompted questions from many on social media about whether this was a fake-out that would turn out to actually be an advertisement.\n\nJames pulled a similar trick in June for what turned out to be an Amazon promotion, although that time he did hashtag \"ad\" in the post.\n\nAs was the case in the middle of the year, Jeff Bezos's retailing goliath has another promotional event set to start on the same day of James's announcement.\n\nNBA content creator Molly Morrison summed up the vibe on X, writing: \"we live in such strange times because either this is an ad or the sports world will be turned upside down.\"\n\nBut that hasn't stopped fans rushing to buy tickets for what could be the last game of an NBA legend.\n\nTicket seller TickPick reported that prices skyrocketed for seats at the Lakers' last regular-season game against the Utah Jazz, the same team against whom Kobe Bryant finished his career with a famous 60-point outing.\n\nSeats had been selling for $85 but the cheapest available seat blew out to over $400 in the wake of his announcement.\n\nA poll on their X profile had hundreds of respondents with almost two-thirds predicting it would turn out to be an ad.\n\nRegardless of what happens, a retirement decision cannot be too far away for the 40-year-old.\n\nHe is a four-time NBA champion with three teams (Miami 2012-13, Cleveland 2016, LA 2020), being named Finals MVP in all those campaigns, as well as regular season MVP four times. He is also the highest point scorer in league history.\n\nLast season he fulfilled what was perhaps his last stated goal, playing alongside Bronny after the Lakers drafted him late in the second round of the 2024 draft.\n\nBronny turned 21 the same day of LeBron's post.",

        "text": "The sudden resignation of France's prime minister \u2014 the country's fifth in two years \u2014 has put President Emmanuel Macron in a bind.\n\nS\u00e9bastien Lecornu resigned on Monday, just 14 hours after unveiling his new cabinet and less than a month after he was appointed PM.\n\nIt's become the latest saga in a period of almost ceaseless political uncertainty since Mr Macron dissolved the National Assembly in June 2024, triggering legislative elections that stacked the parliament's lower house with his opponents.\n\nHere's a closer look at the unprecedented political drama that's been roiling France since then.\n\nA 14-hour government collapses\n\nWhen Mr Lecornu tendered his resignation on Monday morning, he pulled the rug from under the new cabinet that he'd named less than 14 hours earlier.\n\nAgn\u00e8s Pannier-Runacher, the newly reappointed Minister for Ecology and one of Mr Macron's loyal supporters, posted on X: \"I despair of this circus.\"\n\nMacron gives French PM two days to salvage administration after snap resignation Photo shows A man in a suit holds a press conference with a concerned expression. Mr Lecornu stepped down just 14 hours after naming his Cabinet, plunging France into another political crisis.\n\nWith ministers out of a job before they'd even had a chance to settle in, the collapse was a bad look for Mr Macron.\n\nIt reinforced the impression the French leader \u2014 who famously described himself as \"the master of the clocks,\" firmly in control, on his way to winning the presidency for the first time in 2017 \u2014 is no longer in command of France's political agenda.\n\nPerhaps more damaging for Mr Macron were the reasons Mr Lecornu gave for his resignation.\n\nHe explained that the job he was given less than a month ago, after the previous prime minister was tossed out by a National Assembly vote, had proven to be impossible.\n\nFrancois Bayrou was ousted as prime minister in September. (AP: Christophe Ena)\n\nMr Lecornu said three weeks of negotiations with parties from across the political spectrum, unions and business leaders had failed to build consensus behind France's top domestic priority: agreeing on next year's budget.\n\n\"Being prime minister is a difficult task, doubtless even a bit harder at the moment, but one cannot be prime minister when the conditions aren't fulfilled,\" Mr Lecornu said.\n\nWhy does France have a president and a prime minister?\n\nFrance has a semi-presidential system of government, with power shared between the president and prime minister.\n\nEvery five years, the French people elect a president, who then appoints a prime minister \u2014 which also requires the parliament's approval.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhile the president's domain is foreign policy and defence, the prime minister handles domestic affairs.\n\nLuc Rouban, a political science researcher at Sciences Po University in Paris, says it's unlikely Mr Macron will resign despite the internal instability.\n\n\"The central institution remains the president of the Republic ... he remains the leader on international affairs,\" he said.\n\nNo tradition of coalitions\n\nWhen the snap 2024 legislative elections called by Mr Macron backfired and delivered a hung parliament, he believed his centrist camp could continue to govern effectively.\n\nWith no stable majority, they needed to build alliances in the National Assembly.\n\nBut the 577-seat chamber has broadly been split into three main blocs \u2014 left, center and far-right \u2014 and none with enough seats to form a government alone.\n\nFrance has been in political turmoil since the June 2024 elections, which resulted in a divided lower house. (AP: Christophe Ena)\n\nFrance, unlike Germany, the Netherlands and some other countries in Europe, doesn't have a tradition of political coalitions governing together.\n\nMr Macron's political opponents, particularly those on the far-left and far-right, have repeatedly teamed up against the president's prime ministers despite their own ideological differences.\n\nThe French leader's minority governments have toppled one after another, with Gabriel Attal, Michel Barnier, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou and now Mr Lecornu falling since September 2024.\n\nAny successor Mr Macron chooses could be on similarly shaky ground.\n\nAnother dissolution possible\n\nThe alternative for Mr Macron would be dissolving parliament again, ceding to pressure from the far-right in particular for another unscheduled cycle of legislative elections.\n\nMr Macron has previously ruled out resigning himself, vowing to see out his second and last presidential term to its end in 2027.\n\nBut new elections for the National Assembly could be fraught with risk for the French leader.\n\nAnother election could result in more seats for far-right leader Marine Le Pen's party. (Reuters: Stephanie Lecocq)\n\nThe far-right National Rally party of Marine Le Pen, already the largest single party, could come out on top, an outcome that Mr Macron has long sought to avoid.\n\nMr Macron's unpopularity could also deliver a crushing defeat to his centrist camp, giving him even less sway in parliament than he has now.\n\nOr France could get more of the same political deadlock and turmoil.\n\nAP",

        "text": "It felt \"pretty amazing\" when Kaytetye woman Erica Glynn first walked into the writers' room for season two of ABC TV's Mystery Road: Origin.\n\nIt was the first time the series had an all-Blak writers' team, and it inspired an all-too-important level of trust for the screenwriter and director, known for Redfern Now and Black Comedy.\n\nThat trust was necessary considering the weight of the subject they were taking on: the Australian healthcare system, and the disparity between how it treats Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, as well as the part it played in colonial policies, like assimilation.\n\nIt was a \"tricky\" subject to tackle, Glynn admits.\n\n\"We're all dependent on a fairly luxurious national health system \u2026 but there are flaws, particularly in remote areas, and it's a fact of life,\" she says.\n\n\"Things go awry and things bugger up, and that's the truth.\"\n\nMary and Detective Jay Swan return for the second season of Mystery Road: Origin. (Supplied: Bunya Productions)\n\nIn season two of Mystery Road: Origin, junior Aboriginal detective Jay Swan (Mark Coles Smith), and his wife Mary (Tuuli Narkle) have moved from Jay's hometown of Jardine (the setting of season one) to the fictional town of Loch Iris.\n\nIt's around the time of the Sydney 2000 Olympics, and the couple are preparing for the birth of their first child. But their lives are disrupted when another child goes missing.\n\nPast Jay stories \u2014 including the original 2013 movie, Mystery Road, starring Aaron Pedersen \u2014 have seen the steely detective take on the justice system through an Aboriginal lens. But in season two of Mystery Road: Origin, Jay finds himself up against medical institutions.\n\nGlynn and her fellow writers \u2014 Steven McGregor, Jada Alberts, Gary Hamaguchi and Samuel Nuggin-Paynter \u2014 were all intimately familiar with how Australia's medical system can fail Indigenous people, whether from their own experiences or those of their loved ones.\n\nOn the set of drama miniseries True Colours, which Glynn co-wrote and directed. (Supplied: Bradley Patrick)\n\nThat informed the writing of season two of Mystery Road: Origin.\n\n\"Often, you're talking about very fragile, personal stuff [in a writers' room],\" says Glynn.\n\n\" So, there was a level of trust around all of that sharing and getting to the guts of what is quite a prickly subject for our nation. \"\n\nWriting with mob\n\nAn award-winning screenwriter and director, Glynn cut her teeth working at the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association (CAAMA) over three decades ago, and more recently co-created the crime drama series True Colours.\n\nHaving originally trained as a director, she initially came to screenwriting out of frustration.\n\n\"No-one was writing the scripts that I wanted to make as a director, so I had to start writing and found this whole new realm of creativity that I really, really love,\" she says.\n\nNow, Glynn does more screenwriting than anything else. And, as a fan of the series, was \"thrilled\" when she found out there was a spot for her on Mystery Road: Origin.\n\nIndigenous directors Wayne Blair (left) and Jub Clerc (right) on location with Mark Coles Smith. (Supplied: David Dare Parker)\n\nBut this wasn't the first time she's worked with an entirely Blak writing team. In fact, throughout her career, Glynn has exclusively written with mob.\n\n\"I've never been in a story room where it isn't all Blak,\" she says.\n\n\"That's either because I haven't done enough or because I'm lucky enough to be chosen to go into all these Blak story rooms.\"\n\nWriting enigmatic characters\n\nComing to such an established character was a challenge for Glynn. After all, Jay has been at the centre of two movies and two TV series.\n\nWhile the older Jay is guarded and weighed down with trauma, the detective of Origin believes justice is possible and can be a force for good.\n\nYet he's still enigmatic; his thoughts and feelings are rarely on the surface, even as he becomes more disillusioned with the systems in which he works.\n\nThat made him \"difficult\" to write.\n\nGlynn feels \"bloody good\" about herself for having cracked such a character as Jay (pictured). (Supplied: David Dare Parker)\n\n\"You've got to give him emotional intelligence without a lot of dialogue,\" she explains.\n\nThere were writers in the room who knew Jay \"very, very, very, very, very well\", which was both a huge positive, and a barrier of sorts.\n\n\"Even talking about him in the story room was frustrating for me because Steven McGregor \u2014 who's written on all of the series and is the lead Blak writer \u2014 would go: 'No, Jay Swan wouldn't do that',\" Glynn says.\n\nBut on the other side of that frustration came moments of breakthrough and \"feeling bloody good about yourself\" for having cracked the character.\n\nTelling authentic stories\n\nOne of the best things about having an all-Blak writing team is the variety of perspectives and experiences on the stories and themes in the show, Glynn says.\n\nThis was particularly important when writing about Swayze (Aswan Reid; The New Boy), a young boy who is first introduced when the car he's driving swerves into Jay's path.\n\nFeeling safe in an all-Blak writers' room meant Glynn could explore Swayze's (left) trauma. (Supplied: Bunya Productions)\n\nSwayze \"has fear in his heart\" and at times it's unclear whether his fear is a manifestation of his trauma or grounded in something more immediate.\n\n\"Getting inside [Swayze's] mindset was fresh turf for me and difficult,\" Glynn says.\n\n\"Particularly with a subject like this, it was just absolutely crucial that it was all Blackfellas doing it.\n\n\"Also, I felt safe in all of that to be able to express what I needed to express or to be dumb and not know stuff.\"\n\nShe says they could even laugh about some of it.\n\n\"Not the tragedy of it all, but just to be able to be light when we needed to have light. It can be a pretty dark subject matter.\"\n\nMore than anything else though, Glynn wants people to enjoy the mystery at the heart of the story and \"all those beautiful Blak faces on screen\".\n\n\"I want them to do that, but I also want them to be able to ponder something deeper about the state of our nation.\"\n\nStream the new season of Mystery Road: Origin free on ABC iview.",

This was likely a factor in the week\u2019s 1.2pt fall in ANZ-Roy Morgan Australian Consumer Confidence.\n\nOn a four-week moving average basis, weekly inflation expectations are at their highest level since late January. This may have been influenced by the RBA\u2019s post-meeting statement noting that Q3 inflation may come in higher than RBA expectations. We now expect a 0.9% q/q increase in trimmed mean (underlying) inflation in Q3, which suggests the RBA will hold the cash rate for the remainder of the year.\n\nWe now expect the RBA to cut the cash rate by 25bp in February 2026, and for the cash rate to then stay at 3.35% for an extended period.\n\nThe absence of a widely anticipated rate cut later this year could see a slowing of the consumer recovery.",

If all those warrants could have been exercised immediately, in agreeing to purchase AMD\u2019s GPUs OpenAI would have created $US6.3 billion of value for itself from the $US63.4 billion the announcement added to AMD\u2019s market capitalisation. Generative AI apps are tearing through workplaces and are now increasingly used for coding. Credit: iStock Altman has been engaged in a frenzy of high-stakes deal-making in recent weeks that adds up to mind-boggling sums. Apart from the Nvidia and AMD deals, he has committed to buying $US300 billion of computing power from Oracle and is partnering with Oracle, Microsoft, Softbank, Nvidia and others in the $US500 billion Stargate data centres project. He\u2019s also negotiating with Broadcom to develop custom chips for its next generation of AI models.\n\nOpenAI, via the deals with Nvidia, Oracle, the Stargate partners and AMD, has committed to acquiring the equivalent of about 23 gigawatts of computing power at a cost that it estimates will top $US1 trillion. The Nvidia and AMD deals alone will cost OpenAI about $US800 billion over time. The company that ignited the AI boom has been funding itself by raising equity and debt. It will have revenues of about $US13 billion this year, but will lose money because of the scale of the investments it is making. It expects to be profitable in 2029 \u2013 after burning more than $US100 billion of cash. OpenAI has more than 700 million users, but only about five per cent of them pay for its services. That\u2019s reflective of the entire sector, where companies are committing tens of billions of dollars each this year in the hope that eventually there might be a massive commercial return. AI-related investments in the US this year are likely to approach $US400 billion and estimates of the investment required by the end of the decade range from about $US4 trillion to as much as $US7 trillion. The \u201chyperscalers\u201d \u2013 companies like Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, or Meta Platforms, or Microsoft and Amazon \u2013 have the vast cash flows from their existing businesses to fund their investments in data centres and chips, but even they are showing signs of the strain of funding such large non-cash-generating investments.\n\nIt is improbable that all those chasing a position in whatever the AI sectors looks like in future will survive, given the financial stresses involved. The market\u2019s enthusiasm for AI stocks is now being widely compared to the dot-com and telco bubbles a quarter of a century ago. When the dust settled, only a handful of the players survived, but Google and Amazon emerged with the foundations for today\u2019s dominance established. Something similar could be expected if AI is as transformative as it promises to be, although the increasingly incestuous nature of the sector, the exposures to each other\u2019s balance sheets, the need to continually access equity markets for capital consumed in recurrent spending \u2013 GPUs have a useful life of between one and three years before they are made redundant by the next generation of chips \u2013 and the increasing use of debt makes the whole structure of the sector vulnerable. Open AI and Nvidia are both allies and competitors in the quest for AI at, or superior to, human levels of intelligence. They are now formally linked via OpenAI\u2019s commitment to buy Nvidia\u2019s chips and Nvidia\u2019s shareholding in AI. The deal with AMD, which is developing a chip it believes will rival Nvidia\u2019s next generation of chips, diversifies OpenAI\u2019s supply chain and helps a Nvidia competitor which, in turn, might generate some price competition (Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chips can cost up to $US70,000 each) and lower OpenAI\u2019s own costs over time.\n\nGood bubble, bad bubble It also, however, highlights the interdependencies that have developed in the sector, which is again reminiscent of what occurred during the dot-com boom and bust. Loading Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos recently described the investment boom in AI and the stretched valuations afforded to anything AI-related within the sharemarket as a \u201cgood\u201d kind of bubble, saying it was more of an industrial bubble than a financial bubble. He referred to the vast amounts of fibre optic cabling deployed in the 1990s that survived even after most of the companies that laid it didn\u2019t as an example of a good bubble.",

I think being heightened is true. And wearing a uniform and pretending to be small is, you know, pretending. Being heightened is honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the unexpected,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd also I can have all these grandiose aspirations, but I\u2019m very aware of my tiny place in the universe, and so it\u2019s struggling with that.\u201d\n\nMeow Meow \u2013 or Melissa Madden Gray on her birth certificate \u2013 has been in the cabaret game a long time, starting with Perth Festival in 2001. She performs a style of \u201ckamikaze cabaret\u201d, which has been described as \u201calways one step from disaster\u201d. But behind the slips, wardrobe malfunctions and apparent missed cues is a sharp and savvy performer \u2013 every purported misstep is, in fact, a meticulously choreographed performance, designed to get the audience laughing and, as she says, slightly terrified.\n\nThis column is called Lunch With, but to be accurate, today it\u2019s Brunch With, in deference to actor-dancer-musician-cabaret artist Meow Meow\u2019s hectic rehearsal schedule. She initially requested that we meet at Brunswick Street institution Mario\u2019s, but as I recently dined with fellow cabaret legend Moira Finucane there , we\u2019ve ended up at Alimentari, two minutes down the road.\n\nShe\u2019s performed everywhere (London, New York, Berlin, Sydney, Monte Carlo, Hollywood) and with everyone (David Bowie, the Berlin Philharmonic, Alan Cumming, Barry Humphries, Taylor Mac). She\u2019s on the road so much that she doesn\u2019t really have a home base \u2013 \u201cthe world is my home\u201d. Of course that life is glamorous, but it also has a way of grounding a person.\n\nShe was performing a show at Carnegie Hall \u2013 \u201cCarnegie Hall, listener!\u201d she says, bending close to my recorder \u2013 when a friend convinced her to go back up to the foyer to see her sold-out show poster. \u201cThe elevators were broken, so we not only are carrying up all of my suitcases and many mannequins, as I made a fake band, I had a fake massive band on stage with me. The glamour!\u201d She laughs. \u201cCarrying mannequins and suitcases, and we wheel around, and the poster is down. The next one\u2019s up.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the only elevator-related drama for the night, as it turned out; when she returned to her hotel she discovered her band was stuck in the lift. \u201cWe spent half the night with the fire department. It was hilarious. And then walking up the stairs in the hotel because I was too worried about the elevator, with a floppy mannequin banging on each step, thunk-thunk-thunk.\u201d\n\nTurkish eggs with labneh, merguez sausage, and pickled peppers and onions. Credit: Penny Stephens\n\nShe returns to this story several times through our brunch, as it\u2019s emblematic of the kind of performer she is \u2013 a soaring, serious musician who has played the great concert halls of the world, but who also sees the gut-busting hilarity of dragging a mannequin, corpse-like, up the stairs. \u201cBut I think I like the shock of the ridiculousness of your pants being stuck in your knickers because it\u2019s the real things that happen. You think you look fabulous, and then you realise you\u2019ve got a pair of knickers on your head that you used as a scrunchie. Clean knickers, but still. Then you\u2019ve got the audience in a state of slight apprehension, dare I say, and that\u2019s a receptive audience, slightly terrified.\u201d\n\nThere are no knickers on her head today, with Meow looking glamorous and smart in a black velvet tuxedo jacket, her signature wild curls framing her face and her green eyes sparkling beneath fake lashes that reach halfway down her cheeks. \u201cI made an effort!\u201d she laughs. She is slight and extremely beautiful, laughing often, but serious, too, when she talks about art \u2013 both hers and other people\u2019s \u2013 philosophy, the state of the planet and truly dire state of the performing arts world post-COVID. She loves Alimentari and highly recommends the tuna sandwich for a future lunch. But as this is brunch, we both go for eggs \u2013 hers Persian (wilted spinach, shanklish cheese, dukkah, sourdough), mine Turkish (labneh, pickled red onion, aleppo pepper, merguez sausage).",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its launch more than a decade ago, demand for the National Disability Insurance Scheme has grown far beyond expectations - and it is autism - the primary disability for 45 percent of participants - that has received the lion's share of attention.\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth Minister Mark Butler says the NDIS has been the only option for many families.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They love their children. They're desperate - absolutely desperate, I know - to get their children diagnosed. Because we've made it the only way their children can get help.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has now announced an alternative to the NDIS for autistic children, which the Minister hopes will limit growth to the NDIS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thriving Kids - and that is the program I intend to deliver.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of the Minister's surprise announcement, there was concern from some groups - like Yellow Ladybugs, led by Katie Koulas - that it would have a negative impact for neurodiverse children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a one size fits all approach that is not customised. It hasn't had autistic input or approval, so it's actually quite dangerous.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, at a parliamentary committee hearing established by the government to guide the implementation of Thriving Kids - those concerns have only grown.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent MP Monique Ryan has told the inquiry that while an initial $2 billion in funding has been committed to the program, to be collectively matched by states and territories, there are still questions about exactly what services will be offered and who will pay for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I guess the concern is that families want, need and deserve certainty. We're in October 2025, and you're talking about rolling a system out from the first of July 2026. But you're not able to give us any certainty around the timeline for firm agreements between the federal and state governments at this point in time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe uncertainty and anxiety has been heightened all the more, because negotiations between the federal and state governments on another much vaunted plank of NDIS reform known as foundational supports appear to have stalled.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also unclear what those foundational supports will consist of as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo complicate matters, state and territory governments are currently in the middle of negotiations for a new hospital funding agreement, with both New South Wales Labor Premier Chris Minns and Queensland Liberal Premier David Crisafulli among those to complain about federal responsibilities placing pressure on state public health systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Elizabeth Develin is the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Health, Disability and Ageing.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has told the hearing that while new Thriving Kids initiatives are likely to be delivered within existing services such as community healthcare, GPs, schools and early childhood centres, the key difference is that funding is likely to be attached to the service provider rather than the individual.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In essence, it's really to provide people, you know, services that may not be there today because of the growth in the NDIS and really leveraging the mainstream services we have in health and education and childcare settings so that families can be served in the natural settings where these children, sort of, you know, play and grow.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for Jenny Karavalos from the Disability Advocacy and Complaints Service of South Australia, families are already faced with a system that is not designed for their needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The voices of our community are very clear. The families and autistic individuals tell us they're exhausted from navigating fragmented systems. Many just can't afford the basics, saving up reach just to see a GP or fill a script when they finally reach a door. Often it is the wrong door or the right door that people behind it simply do not understand about disability. So services exist in theory, but in practice, families face long wait lists, unaffordable gap fees, and supports that are not trauma informed or inclusive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPlans for the rollout have also worried some experts like Professor Sharon Lawn, the Executive Director of Lived Experience Australia and the former Mental Health Commissioner for South Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says children with learning difficulties or autism that are labelled as mild are actually the most in need of consistent, effective support - because their challenges are too often dismissed as a failure to meet milestones, or even personality problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Professor Lawn says children with so-called mild disabilities are the most likely to bounce between service providers or miss out on support completely, especially if they come from low socio-economic or culturally diverse communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Basic stereotyping is the problem in a lot of service systems. So with children who may be presenting, for example, with behavioural issues, particularly the mild group, particularly where a family may experience socio economic disadvantage, it's easier to jump to, oh, this is the cause of the problem.

        "text": "When your teeth and gums are in good condition, you might not even notice their impact on your day-to-day life. Good oral health helps us chew, taste, swallow, speak and convey emotions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means the state of your mouth can affect nutrition, confidence, forming relationships and maintaining overall good health and wellbeing.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople who have missing or damaged teeth, or other oral health issues such as gum disease, know this all too well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey may not only live with pain that affects their sleep, speech and ability to enjoy certain foods, but often also face discrimination and stigma.\n\n\n\nSo, why is it so shameful to have missing teeth or gum disease? And what can we do about it?\n\n\n\nThe social and psychological impact\n\nOral health is deeply tied to social status. People who don\u2019t have good teeth often face stereotypes about their health, wealth and even their intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, in one 2010 study from the United Kingdom, researchers showed young people photographs of the same person, modified with different levels of tooth decay.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhenever decayed teeth were visible, participants rated the person lower in intelligence, social skills, confidence, self-esteem and whether they appeared happy \u2014 based only on the photo.\n\n\n\nThese stereotypes can lead to bullying and stigma that scar people for life.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a recent study with colleagues, we looked at nationally representative data on 4,476 children from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found losing teeth to decay or injury was relatively common, affecting one in ten children. These children then had a 42 per cent higher risk of being bullied at school.\n\n\n\nThese stigmatising experiences can lead to feelings of shame, embarrassment and low self-esteem. In some cases, they can mean people are less likely to seek dental care, fearing further humiliation or blame that they have neglected themselves.\n\n\n\nDental care is often out of reach\n\nTooth decay and gum disease are the most common oral diseases in Australia and can lead to missing teeth. These conditions can occur at any age, from childhood to adulthood, but they usually worsen with age.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet the government\u2019s Child Dental Benefits Schedule only covers dental care for children aged 17 and under whose parents receive government benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome states and territories also provide oral care for eligible older adults. But long waiting lists show the public system is stretched.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means oral health care remains inaccessible and unaffordable for many Australians.\n\n\n\nPoor oral health affects everyday life\n\nArguments for improving oral health almost always focus on preventing other physical health conditions. For example, one large study of 172,630 adults in New South Wales found those with missing teeth or poor oral health were more likely to die from heart disease.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet when people can\u2019t afford to fix their own oral health issues or their children's, there can be other serious flow-on effects for their day-to-day life and wellbeing, beyond physical health.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch shows when people are in pain from tooth decay they are more likely to take days off work and school. This can have long-term negative effects, disrupting education and employment.\n\n\n\nResearch shows when people are in pain from tooth decay they are more likely to take days off work and school. Source: Getty / ArtistGNDphotography Parents may also need to take time off work to take children to the dentist or dental hygienist. They often face financial pressures due to high out-of-pocket costs for dental treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch shows when people can\u2019t afford dental treatments they may feel powerless to control their circumstances. As a result, they may choose cheaper treatments, such as having a tooth extracted even when it could have been saved.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has also been a recent surge in people using superannuation to pay for dental treatments, for largely preventable conditions. This will further entrench financial disadvantage.\n\n\n\nSo, what's the fix?\n\nResearch I conducted with colleagues this year found 96 per cent of working-aged adults in Australia believe oral health care is essential.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there continue to be significant financial barriers in getting required treatment, particularly for people who are unemployed, have low incomes or those with disability.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, making dental care more affordable and accessible is an important step. This will encourage timely care and make sure check-ups aren\u2019t a luxury for those who can afford them.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut while dental visits are important, they can\u2019t provide sustainable and long-term protection from oral diseases when the social conditions and behaviours that lead to poor oral health stay the same.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperiencing stigma because of poor oral health can be highly personal and feel shameful. But the burden to fix this should not be on individuals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main causes of oral diseases are behaviours \u2014 such as having a lot of sugar, alcohol and tobacco, or poor oral hygiene \u2014 and high levels of stress.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know these behaviours and stress are more common among people who experience social disadvantage.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we need broader policies that address the social conditions in which people live, work, age and grow \u2014 for example, by making access to nutritious food more accessible and affordable.\n\n\n\n\n\nReducing disadvantage is the key to addressing both tooth decay and gum disease and the stigma attached to these oral health issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnkur Singh is the chair of Lifespan Oral Health at the University of Sydney.

        "text": "France's Prime Minister S\u00e9bastien Lecornu has resigned just hours after forming his cabinet, plunging the European nation further into political deadlock.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron named Lecornu, a former defence minister, to the post last month.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the largely unchanged cabinet Macron unveiled to work with Lecornu late on Sunday (local time) sparked fierce criticism across the political spectrum.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Lecornu said the conditions were not satisfied to allow him to stay in office.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The conditions were not fulfilled for me to carry out my function as prime minister,\" Lecornu said, denouncing the \"partisan appetites\" of factions who he said had forced his resignation.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE French parliament ousts prime minister, deepening political crisis for Macron\n\nMarine Le Pen, the leader in parliament of the far-right National Rally party, urged snap parliamentary elections after Lecornu's resignation was announced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A dissolution (of parliament) is absolutely necessary\", Le Pen said. She added it would be \"wise\" for Macron to resign, a move the president has previously ruled out.\n\n\n\n\n\nLecornu's 27-day stint in office was the shortest ever for a prime minister in modern France.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe had faced the daunting task of finding approval in a deeply divided parliament for an austerity budget for next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nLecornu's two immediate predecessors, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou and Michel Barnier, were ousted by the legislative chamber in a standoff over the spending plan.\n\n\n\nFrance's public debt has reached a record high, official data showed last week.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance's debt-to-GDP ratio is now the European Union's third-highest after Greece and Italy, and is close to twice the 60 per cent permitted under EU rules.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious governments had rammed the last three annual budgets through parliament without a vote, a method allowed by the constitution but deeply criticised by the opposition.\n\n\n\n\n\nLecornu had promised last week to ensure legislators were able to vote on the bill.\n\n\n\n\n\nLecornu's resignation compounds a political crisis that has rocked France for over a year, after centrist Macron called legislative elections in 2024, which ended in a hung parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrance has been mired in deadlock since Macron gambled on the snap parliamentary elections in the middle of last year in the hopes of bolstering his authority.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move backfired, leaving the Macron-friendly bloc in the assembly in a minority.\n\n\n\n",

If all those warrants could have been exercised immediately, in agreeing to purchase AMD\u2019s GPUs OpenAI would have created $US6.3 billion of value for itself from the $US63.4 billion the announcement added to AMD\u2019s market capitalisation. Generative AI apps are tearing through workplaces and are now increasingly used for coding. Credit: iStock Altman has been engaged in a frenzy of high-stakes deal-making in recent weeks that adds up to mind-boggling sums. Apart from the Nvidia and AMD deals, he has committed to buying $US300 billion of computing power from Oracle and is partnering with Oracle, Microsoft, Softbank, Nvidia and others in the $US500 billion Stargate data centres project. He\u2019s also negotiating with Broadcom to develop custom chips for its next generation of AI models.\n\nOpenAI, via the deals with Nvidia, Oracle, the Stargate partners and AMD, has committed to acquiring the equivalent of about 23 gigawatts of computing power at a cost that it estimates will top $US1 trillion. The Nvidia and AMD deals alone will cost OpenAI about $US800 billion over time. The company that ignited the AI boom has been funding itself by raising equity and debt. It will have revenues of about $US13 billion this year, but will lose money because of the scale of the investments it is making. It expects to be profitable in 2029 \u2013 after burning more than $US100 billion of cash. OpenAI has more than 700 million users, but only about five per cent of them pay for its services. That\u2019s reflective of the entire sector, where companies are committing tens of billions of dollars each this year in the hope that eventually there might be a massive commercial return. AI-related investments in the US this year are likely to approach $US400 billion and estimates of the investment required by the end of the decade range from about $US4 trillion to as much as $US7 trillion. The \u201chyperscalers\u201d \u2013 companies like Google\u2019s parent, Alphabet, or Meta Platforms, or Microsoft and Amazon \u2013 have the vast cash flows from their existing businesses to fund their investments in data centres and chips, but even they are showing signs of the strain of funding such large non-cash-generating investments.\n\nIt is improbable that all those chasing a position in whatever the AI sectors looks like in future will survive, given the financial stresses involved. The market\u2019s enthusiasm for AI stocks is now being widely compared to the dot-com and telco bubbles a quarter of a century ago. When the dust settled, only a handful of the players survived, but Google and Amazon emerged with the foundations for today\u2019s dominance established. Something similar could be expected if AI is as transformative as it promises to be, although the increasingly incestuous nature of the sector, the exposures to each other\u2019s balance sheets, the need to continually access equity markets for capital consumed in recurrent spending \u2013 GPUs have a useful life of between one and three years before they are made redundant by the next generation of chips \u2013 and the increasing use of debt makes the whole structure of the sector vulnerable. Open AI and Nvidia are both allies and competitors in the quest for AI at, or superior to, human levels of intelligence. They are now formally linked via OpenAI\u2019s commitment to buy Nvidia\u2019s chips and Nvidia\u2019s shareholding in AI. The deal with AMD, which is developing a chip it believes will rival Nvidia\u2019s next generation of chips, diversifies OpenAI\u2019s supply chain and helps a Nvidia competitor which, in turn, might generate some price competition (Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chips can cost up to $US70,000 each) and lower OpenAI\u2019s own costs over time.\n\nGood bubble, bad bubble It also, however, highlights the interdependencies that have developed in the sector, which is again reminiscent of what occurred during the dot-com boom and bust. Loading Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos recently described the investment boom in AI and the stretched valuations afforded to anything AI-related within the sharemarket as a \u201cgood\u201d kind of bubble, saying it was more of an industrial bubble than a financial bubble. He referred to the vast amounts of fibre optic cabling deployed in the 1990s that survived even after most of the companies that laid it didn\u2019t as an example of a good bubble.",

I think being heightened is true. And wearing a uniform and pretending to be small is, you know, pretending. Being heightened is honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the unexpected,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd also I can have all these grandiose aspirations, but I\u2019m very aware of my tiny place in the universe, and so it\u2019s struggling with that.\u201d\n\nMeow Meow \u2013 or Melissa Madden Gray on her birth certificate \u2013 has been in the cabaret game a long time, starting with Perth Festival in 2001. She performs a style of \u201ckamikaze cabaret\u201d, which has been described as \u201calways one step from disaster\u201d. But behind the slips, wardrobe malfunctions and apparent missed cues is a sharp and savvy performer \u2013 every purported misstep is, in fact, a meticulously choreographed performance, designed to get the audience laughing and, as she says, slightly terrified.\n\nThis column is called Lunch With, but to be accurate, today it\u2019s Brunch With, in deference to actor-dancer-musician-cabaret artist Meow Meow\u2019s hectic rehearsal schedule. She initially requested that we meet at Brunswick Street institution Mario\u2019s, but as I recently dined with fellow cabaret legend Moira Finucane there , we\u2019ve ended up at Alimentari, two minutes down the road.\n\nShe\u2019s performed everywhere (London, New York, Berlin, Sydney, Monte Carlo, Hollywood) and with everyone (David Bowie, the Berlin Philharmonic, Alan Cumming, Barry Humphries, Taylor Mac). She\u2019s on the road so much that she doesn\u2019t really have a home base \u2013 \u201cthe world is my home\u201d. Of course that life is glamorous, but it also has a way of grounding a person.\n\nShe was performing a show at Carnegie Hall \u2013 \u201cCarnegie Hall, listener!\u201d she says, bending close to my recorder \u2013 when a friend convinced her to go back up to the foyer to see her sold-out show poster. \u201cThe elevators were broken, so we not only are carrying up all of my suitcases and many mannequins, as I made a fake band, I had a fake massive band on stage with me. The glamour!\u201d She laughs. \u201cCarrying mannequins and suitcases, and we wheel around, and the poster is down. The next one\u2019s up.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the only elevator-related drama for the night, as it turned out; when she returned to her hotel she discovered her band was stuck in the lift. \u201cWe spent half the night with the fire department. It was hilarious. And then walking up the stairs in the hotel because I was too worried about the elevator, with a floppy mannequin banging on each step, thunk-thunk-thunk.\u201d\n\nTurkish eggs with labneh, merguez sausage, and pickled peppers and onions. Credit: Penny Stephens\n\nShe returns to this story several times through our brunch, as it\u2019s emblematic of the kind of performer she is \u2013 a soaring, serious musician who has played the great concert halls of the world, but who also sees the gut-busting hilarity of dragging a mannequin, corpse-like, up the stairs. \u201cBut I think I like the shock of the ridiculousness of your pants being stuck in your knickers because it\u2019s the real things that happen. You think you look fabulous, and then you realise you\u2019ve got a pair of knickers on your head that you used as a scrunchie. Clean knickers, but still. Then you\u2019ve got the audience in a state of slight apprehension, dare I say, and that\u2019s a receptive audience, slightly terrified.\u201d\n\nThere are no knickers on her head today, with Meow looking glamorous and smart in a black velvet tuxedo jacket, her signature wild curls framing her face and her green eyes sparkling beneath fake lashes that reach halfway down her cheeks. \u201cI made an effort!\u201d she laughs. She is slight and extremely beautiful, laughing often, but serious, too, when she talks about art \u2013 both hers and other people\u2019s \u2013 philosophy, the state of the planet and truly dire state of the performing arts world post-COVID. She loves Alimentari and highly recommends the tuna sandwich for a future lunch. But as this is brunch, we both go for eggs \u2013 hers Persian (wilted spinach, shanklish cheese, dukkah, sourdough), mine Turkish (labneh, pickled red onion, aleppo pepper, merguez sausage).",

        "text": "Australia Post is calling on drivers across the country to pay greater attention to the nation's postal workers on our roads, amid a \"deeply concerning\" spate of accidents in the last 12 months.\n\nThe agency announced to the public that an incredible 280 posties were injured as a result of \"third-party traffic accidents\" in the last financial year \u2014 a shocking five incidents per week \u2014 with wounds ranging from lacerations to broken limbs, to concussions and even serious trauma. It is a significant increase on the 86 posties injured over the previous financial year.\n\nAs a result, many staff were forced to take time off work for hospital treatment, while others were left with \"ongoing psychological trauma\". The loss of postal workers impacts services, prompting the organisation to take \"comprehensive measures\" to combat the worrying trend.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo News, an Australia Post spokeswoman encouraged drivers to be on alert for posties, particularly ahead of the festive season. \"The number of posties getting injured on the road has increased, and the numbers are concerning,\" she said.\n\n\"Especially over the next few months as we ramp up deliveries in the lead-up to Christmas, we are asking all drivers to be alert and keep an eye out for our posties.\"\n\nAusPost expands electric vehicle rollout amid increase in unsafe driver behaviour\n\nThe stark figures underscore the urgent need for all motorists to take greater responsibility for road safety, Australia Post General Manager of Safety, Russell Munro, said.\n\n\"Every day, our team members are out in communities delivering for Australians, but increasingly, they\u2019re also being put at risk by unsafe driver behaviour,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nHe said Australia Post is taking a range of steps to improve safety, including reducing the motorcycle fleet, expanding the rollout of electric delivery vehicles (eDVs), and upgrading telematics systems with video and data monitoring across thousands of vehicles.\n\n\"Our data shows that the severity of injury to a postie when involved in a motor accident is reduced when operating an eDV. In some instances, our team have walked away from the accident with only minor injuries,\" Munro said, noting that these measures help minimise harm when accidents do occur.\n\n\"Our priority is to deliver for all Australians whilst ensuring the safety of our team members, so they return home to their families safely each day. However, road safety is a shared responsibility, and we urge all drivers to keep an eye out for our posties,\" he said.\n\nSome of the most common third-party accidents in the past year included drivers failing to give way to posties at intersections and roundabouts, not leaving enough space to stop safely, cutting corners, overtaking on the wrong side of the road, driving distracted while using a mobile phone, and not paying attention to footpaths when postal workers were on scooters or bikes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nSafety measures for postal workers increased\n\nTuesday's Australia Post announcement comes after it recently ramped up efforts to protect staff from an alarming increase in violent dog attacks. In June, it was revealed that posties would now be equipped with a new deterrent \u2014 citronella spray \u2014 following the spike across the past six months.\n\nThe national service warned that since November 2024, over 1,150 encounters with a threatening dog had been recorded, with an average of nine posties forced to flee for their safety every day.\n\n\"Despite public awareness efforts and rigorous safety protocols, we continue to see alarming rates of dog-related incidents,\" Munro said.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Apart from the normal bites and scratches, we\u2019ve seen posties knocked off bikes. We\u2019ve also seen psychological trauma for our posties following serious dog attacks. Last year, one of our posties had her foot seriously injured when a dog bit through her boot.\"\n\nPosties are now equipped with citronella spray following a spike in violent dog attacks.
