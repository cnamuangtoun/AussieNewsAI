        "text": "A breakthrough three-way IVF treatment in the UK resulted in the birth of \ufeffeight babies that showed no signs of mitochondrial DNA disease that their mothers were at high risk of passing on.\n\nMitochondrial DNA mutations can cause devastating disease in one in 5000 babies born around the world.\n\nThe mutations are passed on from mother to child - while male children can be affected, adult males do not pass it on.\n\nA new study could signal a way to avoid incurable mitochondrial disease. (Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nHarmful mutations in mitochondrial DNA can result in reduced availability of energy, particularly affecting tissues that have high energy demands \u2013 for example, the heart, muscle and brain\ufeff.\n\nThere is no cure.\ufeff\n\nBut the University of Newcastle today announced the results of a new procedure, which involves transferring a key \"nuclear\" genome from the \ufefffertilised egg carrying a mitochondrial DNA mutation, to a donated egg without a mutation, and that has had its nuclear genome removed.\n\nREAD MORE: Two teenagers charged with murder over deadly stabbing\n\nPronuclear transfer could mitigate the risks of mitochondrial disease. (Australian Science Media Centre)\n\nThe nuclear genome contains all the genes essential for a person's individual characteristics, such as, hair colour and height, so the child carried from this procedure thus inherits those characteristics from its birth parents, but without the mitochondrial DNA mutation, due to the use of the donor egg.\n\nThe trial saw eight babies, including a pair of identical twins, born to seven women.\n\nAll the babies showed either no signs of mitochondrial DNA mutation or very low levels that were\ufeff unlikely to result in disease.\n\n\"After years of uncertainty this treatment gave us hope \u2013 and then it gave us our baby,\" one of the mothers said.\n\n\"We look at them now, full of life and possibility, and we're overwhelmed with gratitude. Science gave us a chance.\"\n\nAustralia hopes to follow suit\n\nAbout 60 babies born in Australia every year will develop mitochondrial disease, including disabling and potentially fatal conditions.\n\nAnd about 120,000 Australians carry disease-causing DNA variants that put them at risk of passing it on.\ufeff\n\nThe passage of Maeve's Law in March 2022 allowed the introduction of mitochondrial donation in Australia, \ufeffand the Medical Research Future Fund in 2023 provided $15 million towards a pilot program.\n\nThe mitoHOPE Program's clinical trial will be the first of its kind in Australia to determine the safety and efficacy of mitochondrial donation.\n\nAccording to Professor John Carroll, director of Monash's Biomedicine Discovery Institute and head of mitoHOPE, the UK studies should give Australia momentum to follow suit.\n\n\"We hope to soon obtain our first licence from the NHMRC's Embryo Research Licensing Committee, so that we can begin training our IVF embryologists in the procedure using donated eggs,\" Carroll said.\n\n\"The birth of eight babies with a greatly reduced risk of developing mitochondrial DNA disease provides hope for those waiting to access mitochondrial donation and shines new light on the path toward introducing mitochondrial donation in Australia.\n\n\"The findings published give grounds for optimism. I look forward to continuing this work at Monash University and I hope that the new treatment can soon become available to Australian families affected by these devastating diseases.\"\n\nFederal Health Minister Mark Butler said the government was proud to support the research.",

        "text": "Donkey Kong Bananza is an imperfect masterpiece.\n\nIts ambition pushes Nintendo's new console \u2014 the Nintendo Switch 2 \u2014 up to and beyond its limit; serving as both a technical showcase and a reality check.\n\nThankfully, the slowdown and frame stutter doesn't detract from one of the best final boss fights I have ever experienced, nor the fun of what will be a game of the year contender.\n\nDonkey Kong Bananza is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17. (Nine)\n\nDonkey Kong's first 3D outing in 25 years plays like a power fantasy.\n\nAnd once you get the hang of controlling an ape that's bigger, faster and stronger than Mario, you won't want to stop.\n\nREAD MORE: Australia to feature in major new gaming release \ufeff\n\nA Donkey Kong Odyssey\n\nIn case you missed it, Donkey Kong Bananza was crafted by the team that made 2017's incredible Super Mario Odyssey .\n\nThere are a lot of similarities but they are very different games.\n\nBananza 's worlds are comparatively massive and they are destructible.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, these worlds are some of Nintendo's best. There are way more than you might expect, most feature a wonderful gimmick and DK can punch his way through almost all of them.\n\nHe can rip chunks off a wall, the floor and from enemies and then use that chunk as a weapon. You can throw it like a projectile, use it as a platform to double jump with or ride it to \"surf\" across water and spikes.\n\nThis looks very familiar... (Nine)\n\nYou'll need to master all of the above if - like me - you plan on collecting every secret.\ufeff\n\nAt its heart, Donkey Kong Bananza is an old-school collectathon.\n\nThere are more than 700 \"Banandium Gems\" to collect and hundreds more fossils to find, which can be traded for costumes that give DK buffs like faster swimming or reduced damage from poison or icy water.\n\nYou'll stumble across plenty of both as you naturally progress the story, but you'll have to stray off (and under) the beaten path to find everything.\n\nLike Mario Odyssey, most of these rewards are tied to besting bosses, challenges or environmental puzzles. Almost all of these tasks are unique but some - like finding Cranky Kong or buying a Banandium Gem from the shop - are basically repeated across multiple levels, which I'm not a huge fan of.\n\nDonkey Kong Bananza title screen. (Nine)\n\nAgain, like Mario Odyssey , the names of each Banandium Gem are a cute nod to where it is or how to unlock it. However, unlike Mario Odyssey , there's no way to get those helpful hints from a friendly NPC. You're never told what that name of a gem is until after you find it. Instead, you can bash your way through an environment to find buried treasure maps that pinpoint the location of a gem or fossil on your map but that takes away some of the fun.\n\nJourney to the centre of the Earth\n\nBananza 's story is both wonderfully simple and straight up (sorry for the pun) bananas.\n\nDK just loves and wants bananas.\n\nBut when a villain comes to steal those bananas, DK's mining colony gets squashed underground and he gets partnered with a singing rock that quickly transforms into a shy, 13-year-old called Pauline, who recruits DK on a mission to the earth's core where they can make a wish to return to the surface.\n\nPauline grants DK all new powers. (Nine)\n\nLike with magic, the trick is to not think too hard and just enjoy the show.\n\nNintendo is the master of keeping things ambiguous. Fans will pour over references to Pauline's grandmother and when she calls New Donk City \"my city\" but the game never gives any definitive explanation as to why Pauline is 13, where the story fits on a \"timeline\" or if the story is somehow connected to Super Mario Odyssey .\n\nWhat matters is the charming relationship between a silent ape and his shy companion.\n\nPauline narrates most of what happens on screen and - if you jump into bed for a rest - she'll regale DK with a little story about her hopes as he falls asleep. It's incredibly endearing and that charm extends to cute idle animations like Pauline playing with DK's hair.\n\nThey really feel like a perfect pair. And as DK helps Pauline find her voice, she grants him powers that we'd never imagined.\n\nNow you're playing with power\n\nDonkey Kong is a beefy boy, and Nintendo leans right into that power fantasy.\n\nOn top of DK's standard bone-shattering punches, he can unlock the ability to transform into five super-powered animals. These are called Bananzas.\n\nNintendo has already revealed three of these: the Kong (super strength), Zebra (super speed) and Ostrich (flying) Bananzas.\n\nTo call them overpowered is an understatement. These powers would break most games. Here you're encouraged to break everything. You can trigger each Bananza at any time, anywhere and (because there's so much gold just lying about) the metre required to activate a Bananza is pretty much always full.\n\nREAD MORE: New games and hardware unveiled by PlayStation \ufeff\n\nZebra Kong?! (Nine)\n\nThere are specific challenges for each transformation and, like DK himself, each can be levelled up to be even stronger.\n\nNo one is really talking about how amazing the music is when you activate these - but it's incredible. The Zebra one in particular is such a vibe. There's a lot of Splatoon 's DNA in each of these tracks, adding to what is already a stellar, nostalgia-filled soundtrack. Nintendo has been nailing its soundtracks of late and I can't wait for Bananza 's to be added to the Nintendo Music app.\n\nShould I buy it?\n\nIf you've purchased a Nintendo Switch 2, chances are you're going to buy this game.\n\nIt's big, it's beautiful, it's charming and it's fun.\n\nYes, it's disappointing that the game's performance isn't flawless. Typically, I'd expect more from Nintendo - especially when it's the 3D Mario team. Its framerate issues appear to be more pronounced in larger levels - and while I haven't done a frame-by-frame analysis - I think things looked smoother in handheld mode when VRR was enabled.\n\nAI upscaling does a lot of the heavy lifting to make the game look as nice as possible, but its flaws are obvious too. If you spin the camera around fast enough, the hearts in DK's health bar start to blur together, which I've never seen in a Nintendo game before!\n\nRegardless, if you've been waiting for a classic collectathon on the Nintendo Switch 2, look no further.\n\nThe most anticipated video games of 2025 View Gallery",

        "text": "Australia's unemployment rate rose to 4.3 per cent in June, up from 4.1 per cent in May, after the Reserve Bank surprised markets last week by keeping interest rates on hold.\n\n\"The sharp rise in unemployment in June makes the RBA's decision to leave rates on hold earlier this month look like a policy error,\" Abhijit Surya, senior Asia-Pacific economist at Capital Economics, said.\n\n\"We're increasingly convinced that the incoming data flow will prompt the bank to cut rates further than most are currently anticipating,\" he said.\n\nRBA defies expectations of interest rate cut Photo shows Sliding glass doors into a building with the words Reserve Bank of Australia written above. The Reserve Bank had been expected to cut the cash rate to 3.6 per cent, to its lowest since April 2023.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Statistics data, employment increased by 2,000 people in June, but the number of officially unemployed people jumped by 33,600.\n\nSince employment (+2,000) and unemployment (+33,600) both increased in June, the size of the active labour force grew by 35,600.\n\nThe growth in the labour force helped the participation rate to increase a little, from 67 to 67.1 per cent \u2014 putting it just shy of its record-high of 67.2 per cent in January.\n\nBut part-time employment grew by 40,000 people, while full-time employment fell by 38,000 people, which contributed to a noticeable decline in monthly hours worked in all jobs and a slight rise in the underemployment rate.\n\nThe employment-to-population ratio remained at 64.2 per cent in June.\n\nHarry Murphy Cruise, head of economic research for Oxford Economics Australia, said the data suggested the RBA should \"get a wriggle on\" with another rate cut.\n\n\"The weak print follows a meek reading in May,\" he said.\n\n\"Back then, we weren't convinced the data signalled a sharp rise in joblessness was looming. And while we're still not ringing the alarm bells, June's slackening is another good reason for the RBA to get a wriggle on with rate cuts.\n\n\"Looking ahead, the labour market has a number of challenges nipping at its heels.\n\n\"First and foremost, President Trump's tariffs are weighing on business investment and prompting some firms to rethink hiring plans. Even though Aussie businesses are largely out of the direct line of tariff fire, global uncertainty is lapping at our shores,\" he said.",

(ABC News)\n\nThe move follows an ABC investigation revealing major private ATM suppliers were fuelling the illegal tobacco industry, placing their machines in tobacconists where they provided an instant source of cash for off the books transactions.\n\nSome tiny stores selling illegal tobacco even hosted two machines concurrently to cope with the huge demand for cash that fuels a black-market trade.\n\nPayment processing company EFTEX has stopped handling transactions from ATMs in tobacco shops.\n\nThe ABC also revealed that criminals, including a drug dealer, were able to own and operate the private ATMs, which offer money laundering opportunities when merchants were able to load them with their proceeds of crime.\n\nEFTEX said \u2014 in conjunction with partners Big Four banks Westpac and ANZ \u2014 this meant it would stop processing payments from ATMs in tobacconists.\n\nIt would also cull services to other \"high risk\" business operations like the adult entertainment industry from September 15.\n\nThe changes mark a step in the ATM industry, whose backers include prestigious investment bank Macquarie Group, to divorce itself from the illicit sector.\n\nEFTEX says the decision was made amid \"increased regulatory scrutiny\" following the ABC's investigation.

        "text": "After recent research identified buying a property as a cheaper option than renting in Western Australia's resources-rich Pilbara, those looking to purchase locally say it is easier said than done.\n\nWhile the mining and energy industries have brought plentiful jobs and high wages to the north-west, they have also driven up the cost of living for the remote region's residents.\n\nWhen lenders are asking for deposits of up to 40 per cent and insurance costs are astronomical, families like Harriette Smith's \u2014 even with work-based subsidies \u2014 are being left behind.\n\nHarriette Smith says it is difficult to purchase a house in the north west. (ABC Pilbara: Kimberley Putland)\n\nWhile Ms Smith and her family rented through her employer, they were looking for a home to call their own.\n\n\"We want hooks for them to hang school bags, you know? Maybe one day get a pet and just be able to do things,\" she said.\n\n\"One of my kids wants a pink bedroom and a rainbow.\"\n\nHarriette Smith wants to purchase a home for her family without the concern of rental inspections. (ABC Pilbara: Kimberley Putland)\n\nBut Ms Smith and her husband could not afford a home in the current market, even with subsidies provided by their workplaces.\n\n\"[We've been saving] on and off for the past five years,\" Ms Smith said.\n\n\"I feel like we're getting close to having a deposit, and then a trip to Perth comes up or something comes unexpectedly \u2026 and we're not able to afford it.\n\n\"It's not even just the house price \u2014 it's the stamp duty on top of it, and all those extra hidden things that you're not aware of when you get into housing.\"\n\nBuilding, deposits challenging\n\nThe Pilbara's unique housing problem Photo shows A man stands in front of a grey cement wall of an apartment and looks to his left. Despite a joint effort from governments and the resources sector, rents in a remote WA region have soared well past the nation's capitals.\n\nPilbara Development Commission chief executive Simon Taylor said saving for a deposit in the region was more complex than in the city.\n\nMr Taylor said the region's homebuyers faced additional challenges.\n\n\"Incomes are generally much higher in the Pilbara than, say, Perth, but costs of living are higher and that impacts on people's ability to save a deposit,\" he said.\n\n\"It's very difficult for people to secure finance, even if they would really like to move into home ownership.\n\n\"These factors result in very high deposits being required by lenders \u2014 often around 30 to 40 per cent of the cost.\"\n\nSimon Taylor says prospective homebuyers face multiple challenges in the north west. (ABC Pilbara: Kimberley Putland)\n\nBuilding a new home is even more challenging, with the valuation systems employed by banks a limiting factor.\n\n\"The cost of construction and the land generally exceeds the market value of the property,\" Mr Taylor said.\n\n\"That can be by $100,000\u2013$200,000 quite commonly, and banks make an assessment on what they'll lend based on the value, not on the cost.\"\n\nInsurance premiums climbing\n\nProspective buyers also face huge insurance premiums in the state's cyclone-prone north.\n\nInsurance Council of Australia chief executive Andrew Hall said premiums had increased due to more frequent and severe weather events, while some providers had withdrawn from the region altogether.\n\nAndrew Hall says increasingly severe weather events have pushed insurance premiums up. (ABC News: Tobias Hunt)\n\n\"We've seen that on top of inflation, which has flown through the building sector and the motor industry,\" Mr Hall said.\n\n\"We're also seeing global capital, through reinsurance costs and the like, go up.\n\n\"Some insurers provide a lot of coverage in northern Australia, while others don't have the network or the infrastructure to support claims in that region.\"\n\nKarratha residents have told the ABC of quotes for home and contents insurance of up to $8,000 for a two-bedroom house.\n\nChallenge even with work support\n\nThose employed by the resources industry were often eligible for subsidies, but this was something Mr Taylor said lenders did not always account for.\n\n\"You need a high deposit and you're stretched for saving, and then part of your effective income is a housing subsidy \u2014 but then it can't be taken into account,\" he said.\n\n\"If you're trying to save for a house and you're paying high costs and the bank doesn't take account of the housing subsidy in the serviceability, you're in a pretty challenging situation.\"",

(ABC Ballarat: Gavin McGrath)\n\nThe main goal of the Federation University Neurodivergent Club is to support and advocate for students.\n\n\"We are a demographic that doesn't have much support or agency \u2014 there's so much discrimination,\" Mr Valdes said.\n\nMr Valdes has used the club to advocate for a low-sensory space for neurodivergent students dealing with sensory overload, which the university says is under construction.\n\nThe university also has inclusion officers on campus to assist students who seek help and has created \"ND toolkits\" for staff and students, which are online resources featuring advice and strategies for navigating tertiary education.\n\nFederation University study\n\nFederation University has also surveyed its neurodivergent staff and students to identify key barriers to accessing higher education.\n\nAcademic Liam Frost-Camilleri said the results were helping the university work with its neurodivergent cohort.\n\n\"The earlier you engage \u2026 the better, because they will be able to suggest things that you haven't even thought of,\" Mr Frost-Camilleri said.\n\nLiam Frost-Camilleri says a neurodivergent student survey is helping Federation University provide better support. (Supplied: Federation University)\n\nThe study showed a lack of clear communication, \"particularly from lecturers\", was a barrier many students identified, and that professional development and training for staff on how best to support neurodivergent students was \"sorely needed\".\n\n\"There are a lot of systems that many of these students feel have never really helped them, or they don't feel safe enough to really even disclose that they have neurodivergence,\" Mr Frost-Camilleri said.\n\nThe survey found 75 per cent of neurodivergent students said they were used to being self-reliant and 62 per cent said they lacked the confidence to ask for help, while two-thirds feared being labelled or stereotyped if they asked for support.\n\n\"Some students say, 'I don't go and ask [for help] because I want to see if I can do it by myself first,' rather than get the support,\" Mr Frost-Camilleri said.\n\n\"So, it is a problem, [but] there are things that we can do to help support these people.\"\n\nWhat are other universities doing?\n\nRMIT University PhD student Jeremy Nagel has created an app called Focus Bear to help neurodivergent students with their studies by detecting when they are distracted.\n\n\"You tell it what you want to do and then it uses AI to check whether the websites that I have open relate to that goal,\" Mr Nagel said.\n\n\"The inspiration for it was my own lived experiences, as someone who's autistic and has ADHD.\n\n\"I found I was getting distracted a lot, and I wanted something that would actually block me from using my computer at night, and also blocked me from accessing emails in the morning until I've done my meditation and my exercise.\"\n\nJeremy Nagel's Focus Bear app helps neurodivergent students detect distraction.

        "text": "When the Western Bulldogs played the Sydney Swans earlier this year, former footballer and author Brandon Jack got a text about the game from an unlikely source.\n\n\"I got this random message from [author] Helen [Garner] saying, 'I don't know about this Tom Papley,'\" he tells ABC Arts. \"[She thought] he was being a bit of an instigator.\"\n\nGarner, an ardent Western Bulldogs fan whose latest book, The Season, followed the fortunes of her grandson's under-16s AFL team, had found a kindred spirit in Jack.\n\n\"It's so funny that we've become friends, but it's nice that this very highly regarded writer approves of [my] work,\" Jack says.\n\nMixing the unlikely worlds of AFL and literature is very much the MO for Jack, whose new novel, Pissants, takes us to the fringes of AFL football.\n\nThe 31-year-old played 28 games for the Sydney Swans over five years before becoming interested in literature and studying creative writing.\n\nJack (pictured) comes from a sporting family; his older brother Kieren served as co-captain of the Sydney Swans and his father Gary played rugby league for Australia. (Getty Images/Paul Kane)\n\nHis 2021 memoir, 28, won praise from Australia's literary establishment for its insights into masculinity and addiction.\n\nBut Jack says he still \"didn't feel like much of an author\" after writing it.\n\n\" I wanted to explore fiction, creating characters and writing voices. \"\n\nThe purgatory of life as a fringe AFL player\n\nPissants, Jack's first novel, sketches out a world he knows well. It follows a ragtag bunch of contracted AFL players who exist on the periphery of the mega-popular sport.\n\nOur antiheroes \u2014 who have nicknames like Fangs, Mud, Stick, Shaggers and Big Sexy \u2014 don't play much football.\n\n\"Brandon Jack is a talented writer; he can change voices,\" journalist and author James Button tells ABC Radio National's The Bookshelf. (Supplied: Simon & Schuster)\n\nInstead, they train, resent the star players, abuse painkillers to get through an inane sponsor's function, fill out bingo cards of the cliches spouted by the team's ineffective psychologist and get kicked out of nightclubs.\n\nUnderneath all their shenanigans and abrasive behaviour is a deep well of desperation.\n\nBut Jack says he didn't intend Pissants to critique football club culture.\n\n\"I'm sure there are many interpretations of it but, to be completely blunt, I didn't have a message or anything I was trying to solve with this book. I just enjoyed writing it.\"\n\nInstead of mapping out the plot in advance, Jack followed the more freewheeling approach of one of his most admired authors, Booker Prize-winner George Saunders.\n\n\"[Saunders] says that if you try and wrestle back a story from where it's leading you, then you're doing a disservice to it.\"\n\nJune's best books Photo shows A composite image showing eight book covers on a blue and purple background This month our critics hand-pick their top reads, from a queer thriller, new novels from some of Australia's biggest authors and luminous short stories.\n\nPissants departs from traditional novelistic storytelling, including elements such as footnotes, betting slips, Facebook events and transcripts of a kangaroo court the group runs.\n\nSimilarly, we never learn which club the Pissants play for; this information is always blacked out in the text, like a redacted name in a court document.\n\nJack says he was influenced by writers like Irvine Welsh and Jennifer Egan, who use unusual literary devices to flesh out their fictional worlds.\n\nHe also says he used a kaleidoscopic approach out of \"necessity\".\n\n\"To be honest, I'm not the kind of writer who can sustain a single voice for 300 pages. My writing, if I do that, dies on the page, so it made sense for me to bounce around between voices and techniques.\"\n\nBullying as bonding\n\nOne constant in the Pissants group is what looks to outsiders like blatant bullying.\n\nThe players bond through abusing members of their group who step out of line. They also engage in cruel and elaborate pranks at each other's expense.\n\n\"That's definitely very strong in footy clubs,\" Jack says of bullying.\n\nThe group also have scores of elaborate running in-jokes in their group chat.\n\n\"Sometimes, you really want to be in on the joke, even if it's at your expense, because the alternative is loneliness, and that's almost a worse fate,\" Jack says.\n\n\"That's why, in my mind, these players are engaging the way they are. I think they're looking for some sort of meaning and connection to other people, and that's the way they get it.\"\n\nListen to ABC RN's The Bookshelf Photo shows The Bookshelf Podcast Image The latest and best fiction reviewed by a team of dedicated bibliophiles.\n\nNone of the Pissants seem to enjoy their life as footballers. They resent their place in their world but feel powerless to change it.\n\nYet the game is often a large part of their identity and their only developed professional skill.\n\nJack himself had profoundly mixed emotions when the Sydney Swans delisted him, ending his AFL career at just 23.\n\n\"I knew I didn't want to play sport anymore, but I was still f***ing hurt by it,\" he says.\n\n\"I only realised a few years back how lost I was and how much I was struggling.\n\n\" The way I dealt with that was to try and get as far away from football as I could. I didn't watch footy for years, and I didn't really talk about it. \"\n\nFinding solace in humour\n\nJack's characters often deal with their despair through gallows humour. The action often resembles the pitch-black comedy of Quentin Tarantino or the Coen Brothers, especially in a chapter where the players kidnap a teammate's dog for a lark and things go downhill.\n\n\"I'm glad that it's got that humour and that it captures what was, for me, a pretty dark place at times,\" Jack reflects.\n\n\"I'm at a point now where I realise there were things in [that experience] which were seriously funny.\n\n\"The reason for all my searching was that I just wanted somebody else around, to be connected.\n\n\"To be able to write this in a way that conveys both of those things was important.\"",

        "text": "Anthony Albanese is seen with retired Adelaide Zoo panda Fu Ni at a park in Chengdu, China. (AAP: Lukas Coch)\n\nThe prime minister has just visited a breeding centre for giant pandas in the bustling city of Chengdu. These charming creatures are undeniably charismatic and intend to charm almost everyone who sees them.\n\nOn the top of his list at the centre was visiting Fu Ni, a panda who spent many years at Adelaide Zoo as a beloved fixture. The PM visited to say hello and to call her a great ambassador for China. Still, it's worth remembering the Chinese government retains ultimate control of where giant pandas go.\n\nAt the moment, Australia is the only country in the Southern Hemisphere to have a giant panda, although there are 20 or so other countries around the world that have them right now.\n\nThe fact that Premier Li Qiang came to Australia last year to make the announcement that new pandas were to come to Adelaide was taken as a sign that the government's push to stabilise the relationship between Canberra and Beijing was working.\n\nThe fact that the prime minister has come back here essentially to say, \"thank you\", is a sign that Australia wants to recognise that gesture.\n\nAlbanese is going to move on from pandas and head into central Chengdu after this for a lunch focused on medical technology and commerce.\n\nThe pictures won't be nearly as good or charming, but the subject matter is still important, and Australia is really enjoying quite a bit of business success in Chengdu, particularly with companies like Cochlear, which is using the city as a base to export to China's growing middle class.\n\nHowever, at least for the media, and probably for most Australians, the lingering image of this leg of his visit is likely to be these extraordinary creatures, a conservation success story for China, but also a diplomatic tool which it does not hesitate to wield very effectively.",

        "text": "A sculpture widely criticised for its unusual design and cost has received a positive welcome in Mount Gambier at an unveiling kept quiet until it was complete.\n\nThe sculpture, Cast in Blue, represents a kind of mythical megafauna, like those found in the nearby Naracoorte Caves, in the colour of Mount Gambier's famous Blue Lake.\n\nThe City of Mount Gambier council paid $136,000 for the sculpture, while also raising its rates by 10 per cent last year and 8 per cent this year.\n\nThe cost and the design received backlash online, and Cast in Blue was nicknamed \"the blue blob\".\n\nLynette Martin says the sculpture has already had an impact. (ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\nBut during the unveiling on Wednesday afternoon, Mount Gambier Mayor Lynette Martin said the price was worth it to bring people into the city's CBD and to introduce them to stories about the Limestone Coast's natural history.\n\n\"For some, it has already become a beloved new landmark, for others it might take time,\" she said.\n\n\"But art, like all great things, is meant to challenge us, delight us, and stay with us long after we have seen it.\"\n\nThe Cast in Blue sculpture is lifted off a trailer ahead of its unveiling. (ABC South East SA: Conor Burke)\n\nOpinion mixed on arrival\n\nSocial media posts about the sculpture's unveiling attracted hundreds of negative comments within hours.\n\nBut negative comments were harder to find among those at the unveiling and people walking past.\n\n\"I think I love it. Maybe some people will hate it at first, but they will grow into it,\" Rhisang Alfarid said.\n\nStella, 10, and her friend Bethany, 11, both liked the colour of the sculpture.\n\nStella, 10, and Bethany, 11, were there to see Cast in Blue moved into place. (ABC South East SA: Eugene Boisvert)\n\n\"I like that it's dark blue,\" Stella said.\n\n\"I think it's very big and blue,\" Bethany said.\n\nMelbourne tourist Sarah Smail said it was \"quite striking\" and had an interesting backstory about local history, but she understood why people might baulk at the cost.\n\n\"Well, that's a lot of money, and I can understand that people are probably a bit undecided on whether money could be better spent,\" she said.\n\n\"Art is in the eye of the beholder \u2014 not everyone is going to appreciate it.\"\n\nDesigners hope love will grow\n\nMelbourne architects Tom Proctor and Mitch Walker designed the sculpture, which Sculpture Co then fabricated.\n\nDespite its nickname, Mr Proctor said Cast in Blue was not very blob-like and instead represented a real thing that was identifiable as an imagined piece of megafauna.\n\n\"I think that's a pretty unfair characterisation of what it is, I would say,\" he said.\n\n\" We hope that when people can see it in person, they'll be able to actually form a bit of a relationship with it and, particularly children and kids, will be able to fall in love with it. \"\n\nTom Proctor and Mitch Walker designed the Cast in Blue sculpture. (ABC South East SA: Josh Brine)\n\nIn answer to critics of the cost, Mr Walker said it would be more of a waste of money if the project \"faded into the fabric of the city\".\n\n\"We're not trying to be incendiary or reactionary, but I think this project has had a very high impact,\" he said.\n\n\"[It] has gotten a lot of people talking about \u2026 what the identity of Mount Gambier is to them, what public art should look like to them and whether they agree with this piece or not, they've been forced to really solidify their position on that.\"\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nArt can be treasured over time\n\nUniversity of South Australia associate professor of contemporary art Gretchen Coombs said Cast in Blue looked fun, reflected the local history and location, and had a sense of \"come to me\".\n\n\"I think it will be great for the local economy and reflecting the local identity, which is often what public art should do,\" she said.\n\n\" It should give a connecting point, a place to reflect what it is about our area that makes us appealing \u2014 it's our history, it's our landscape \u2014 and I think this does that very well. \"\n\nDr Coombs says people have come to love sculptures that were once derided, like Vault in Melbourne. (ABC Radio Melbourne)\n\nDr Coombs said people usually warmed to contemporary public art over time, even if it was controversial when first installed, especially if visitors appreciated it.\n\n\"Then people become quite, 'Wow, well, it's not as bad as I thought. My cousin from wherever came and they really thought it was interesting. Maybe it's not so bad,'\" she said.",

(ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\n\"It made me realise that I wasn't really bad at these subjects, I just process slower and need a slower environment.\n\n\" That was so amazing to realise that it wasn't that I couldn't do work, I just needed a different environment. \"\n\nThe diagnosis came in late 2023 but by November last year, it became clear that Phoebe could benefit from medication to treat their ADHD.\n\n\"Phoebe was really struggling with school, despite working so hard,\" Ms Jackson said.\n\n\"There were days when Phoebe just couldn't think properly, and I just knew they couldn't do their HSC under these conditions.\"\n\nPsychologists are unable to prescribe medication for ADHD so the hunt for a specialist \u2014 namely, a psychiatrist \u2014 began.\n\nCanberra mother Deraine Jackson says trying to organise getting Phoebe prescribed ADHD medication has been distressing. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nPhoebe's general practitioner (GP), who specialises in ADHD, gave them and Ms Jackson a list of eight specialists in the ACT to contact.\n\n\"I have spent eight months making phone calls, trying to get in, sending emails \u2014 and they've either not got back or their books are closed or they only do under-18s,\" Ms Jackson said.\n\n\"Even though we've got a diagnosis and we've already paid more than $1,000 for that, it was still such a struggle to find a psychiatrist.\n\n\" I was getting so distressed as a parent, it was really heartbreaking. \"\n\nNo one on the list could see Phoebe ahead of the HSC in October, so Ms Jackson called the psychologist in Orange who made the diagnosis and was recommended a psychiatrist in Albury, more than 300km away.\n\nThey have an appointment later this month.\n\nPhoebe said it had felt like they were in a race against time to access medication before the HSC started.\n\nPhoebe Jackson says they want to begin ADHD medication before their HSC. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\n\"It's just taken so long and such a toll \u2014 I see Mum making phone calls all the time and I'm so grateful that she's doing all that for me,\" they said.\n\n\"I really want the medication in time so I don't do really badly on the HSC because I really dislike not doing my best, which is what can happen if I'm not processing properly.\"\n\nAs for Ms Jackson, the single mother doesn't understand why such a common condition is so hard and expensive to diagnose and treat.\n\n\"If I injure my ankle, I call the physiotherapist and I have an appointment the following week,\" she said.\n\n\"This is life and death stuff for our children and it's not that the professionals aren't amazing, they just don't have capacity. There aren't enough of them.\n\n\"I don't know why it's so hard.\"\n\nSoon, it will not be.\n\n'There is a need now': Chief psychiatrist\n\nACT chief psychiatrist Dr Anthony Cidoni says they want to ease the pressure on waiting lists for ADHD treatment and diagnosis. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nThe ACT's chief psychiatrist, Dr Anthony Cidoni, made a commitment in May last year to improving access to ADHD diagnosis and prescribing within 12 months.\n\nA little beyond that deadline, he has revealed plans for a pilot program that will see GPs given more authority to diagnose the condition and additional powers to prescribe ADHD medication \u2014 a task currently only done by paediatricians, neurologists and psychiatrists, who often have lengthy wait lists and charge high fees.\n\nQueensland has had a similar system in place since 2017 for patients aged between four and 18, while New South Wales, Western Australia and South Australia have also committed to rolling out a GP-led ADHD program for young people next year.\n\n\"We know there are a lot of people that are really concerned about the access to diagnosis and the access to prescriptions for ADHD,\" Dr Cidoni said.\n\n\"So, we're really mindful that we need to do something to address the issues that are out there.\"\n\nIn late 2023, a Senate inquiry into ADHD recommended the development of uniform prescribing rules be expedited to ensure consistency between all jurisdictions.\n\nBut Dr Cidoni said it had become evident that achieving that recommendation could take years, and ACT Health decided it could not afford to wait.\n\nGPs are getting new powers to diagnose ADHD and prescribe medication. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\n\"We don't want to wait for that because we think the need is there now,\" Dr Cidoni said.\n\nThe pilot program is slated to start as early as December but no later than January next year, following stakeholder consultation.\n\nCanberra GPs already have some prescribing arrangements, which allow them to prescribe ADHD medication for adolescents for two years and adults for three years, as recommended by a specialist.\n\n\"That is really restricted by what the specialist has determined or the specialist has outlined,\" Dr Cidoni said.\n\n\"What we have planned is two streams \u2014 one stream will be for GPs to be able to do the actual diagnosis and prescribing, and the other stream will be to do the prescribing but on a much broader level than we have now.\n\n\"So, I think we're looking at quite a significant change.\"\n\nThe pilot program will allow around 50 doctors to prescribe ADHD medications like Concerta, Vyvanse and Ritalin. (ABC News: Adam Kennedy)\n\nGeneral practitioners will have to apply to take part in the pilot program and, if approved, will need to complete comprehensive training before taking on patients.\n\nThere will be clinical supervision by a specialist and a requirement for a GP to refer complex patients to either a paediatrician, psychiatrist or neurologist.\n\n\"We've already scoped the level of interest in our GPs in the ACT so we're thinking there would be around 70 to 100 that might be interested in participating in a program like this,\" Dr Cidoni said.\n\n\"A smaller proportion in the diagnosing and treatment arm, and then a larger proportion in the prescribing arm.\n\n\"And if we get the parameters right, in terms of the appropriate education, psychiatrist oversight and access to ongoing support, I believe we can do it safely.\n\n\" We need to recognise that we can't meet this need through our private practitioners so we have to have a different way of managing it, but I wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't safe. \"\n\nWeight lifted from paediatricians' shoulders\n\nDr Kim Bland says the pilot program is needed to release the excessive pressure on Canberra specialists. (ABC News: Michael Barnett )\n\nWhen paediatrician Dr Kim Bland was told GPs would soon take on more of the ADHD workload, she breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nAnd Dr Bland suspects specialists across Canberra will do the same when they hear the news.\n\n\"This is coming as a real relief to paediatricians and to families, it is very much needed,\" Dr Bland said.\n\n\"Even with my books closed and that being well-known, we are still getting daily inquiries from families not just looking for care like they would for other medical conditions, but being in crisis.\n\n\"Not just asking for medical care, but asking for help and rescuing because they're really in a desperate and dire situation, and that's the difference with these children.\"\n\nBilly's mum struggled to find a specialist to diagnose ADHD. Now there are calls for GPs to have greater powers Photo shows Beck Collis and Billy Ellery GPs want to be able to help patients like Billy who have ADHD.\n\nDr Bland said every aspect of life is affected for a child living with undiagnosed ADHD, especially their education and self-esteem, plus the pressure on parents can lead to family breakdown.\n\nShe said turning those families away is one of the most difficult parts of her job.\n\n\"For parents, it's one thing to not know what they can do for their children but it's another to know it's right there, help is available, a diagnosis is available and all the support that comes with it, but they can't access it,\" Dr Band said.\n\nAnd for her, to know there will soon be a team of competent GPs to refer those families to feels like a weight being lifted.\n\n\"It takes some of that weight that is sitting on top of us and contributing to our burnout away. It really is a pressure valve for us,\" Dr Bland said.\n\nConfidence in GP take-up\n\nDr Kerrie Aust says it's important people can access timely care for suspected ADHD. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nDr Kerrie Aust, the ACT president for the Australian Medical Association, said it made perfect sense for general practitioners to play a more significant role in the ADHD space.\n\nShe is hopeful she will get approval to be among the group of GPs able to diagnose ADHD and prescribe medication for the condition.\n\n\"We are seeing an increase in young people and adults coming in to have discussions about whether they might have ADHD and it's really important they access care in a timely manner,\" Dr Aust said.\n\n\"While psychiatrists and paediatricians have really been trying to step up into that space, I think this is a good example where GPs can work to the full of their breadth of scope and get involved in the diagnosis and management, especially where those cases are relatively straightforward and we've got proven treatments.\"\n\nDr Aust said she was confident the take-up by general practitioners would be strong enough to have an affect on patient care.\n\nDr Kerrie Aust believes there will be stong enough take-up of the pilot by general practitioners. (ABC News: Romy Stephens)\n\n\"Every little bit counts \u2014 if one doctor can see two or three new patients a week, then that's a huge change to the backlog,\" Dr Aust said.\n\n\"It also creates space for the paediatricians and psychiatrists to focus their attention on some of the more complex diagnostic cases, or where we're having trouble managing the medications.\"\n\nBut she warned potential patients not to expect a diagnosis within a standard quarter-hour consultation.\n\n\"There will still need to be patience around a diagnostic assessment,\" Dr Aust said.\n\n\"It's not going to be a case of booking the 15-minute appointment and coming in and walking out with a diagnosis \u2014 it will still take time and patience, and we may need to try a few things before we get it right.\n\n\"But I do think being able to access regular care with your GP is a really positive step.\"\n\nPotential patients have been warned not to expect an ADHD diagnosis within a 15-minute GP appointment. (ABC News: Luke Stephenson)\n\nPilot age limit not yet clear\n\nThere will be an age limit for patients being seen as part of the pilot, with Dr Cidoni still to decide whether 18 or 26 is the most appropriate option.\n\nDr Bland said she would urge him to extend the age to 26.\n\n\"A lot of paediatricians are looking after children after the age of 18 because there is no one to transition their care over to,\" Dr Bland said.\n\n\"Usually by the time they're an adult, they're on a very stable dose, they've got a very good support around them, they know when they need to speak to their therapist, they know when they need to adjust their dose.\n\n\"And if anything, it's slightly more simple diagnosing past that age, so that would be a group I think would benefit greatly from seeing their GP.\"\n\nDr Kim Bland believes the patient age limit for the pilot program should be 26. (ABC News: Adam Kennedy)\n\nDr Aust agreed, adding she had seen a growing gap in care for patients aged between 16 and 24.\n\n\"Often, young people who have been diagnosed when they were in primary school, they may have been lost to follow-up for a long period of time and we don't have access to their previous diagnostic records,\" she said.\n\n\"And in those cases, it's both challenging and expensive to have those assessments.\n\n\"We really find that they run into trouble as they get into the workplace or they're attending university, and that's a group that I would really love to see supported.\"\n\nBoth doctors agreed that it should be a question of complexity, not age, but acknowledged the pilot program had to start with some parameters in place.\n\nDeraine Jackson says school would have been a completely different experience for Phoebe if they'd had access to a diagnosis sooner. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nWhen Ms Jackson considers how Phoebe's experience could have been different had their diagnosis come from a general practitioner, she is brought to tears.\n\n\"If we'd been able to go to a GP and they could have done tests the moment the anxiety and depression started, it would have been a totally different journey,\" Ms Jackson said.\n\n\"School would have been a completely different experience for Phoebe, I would have parented differently \u2014 so much would have been different.\n\n\"And it would have been so much more affordable. The cost is a really big impact \u2014 it is costing thousands of dollars out-of-pocket for these specialist appointments.\n\n\"It's obviously too late for us, but maybe there's a little undiagnosed girl in Year 7 who can be picked up by her GP and find life a much easier journey as a result.\"",

Van der Poel launched a fierce pursuit but fell short.\n\nThe focus now shifts to stage 12, which brings the Tour's first high-mountain showdown with a summit finish on the legendary Hautacam.\n\nAll eyes will be on Poga\u010dar the day after his crash.\n\nReuters",

        "text": "That\u2019s three top-eight teams, two of the bottom three, plus Port. Crucially, the Crows have their tougher opponents \u2013 the Suns, Hawks and Pies \u2013 all at Adelaide Oval. Assuming they maintain form, there\u2019s a fair chance the Crows, who have 12 wins, will finish top two; certainly, they have better prospects, based on their final six games, of winning 17 games than the Lions (who have 12\u00bd).\n\nThe problem The Lions\u2019 tough run home wouldn\u2019t be unjust if it was the result of fixturing swings and roundabouts, and it\u2019s true that Geelong have already played and beaten Collingwood, Adelaide, Gold Coast, Hawthorn and Fremantle \u2013 the Cats, to a degree, did the harder yards early.\n\nThe primary cause of the fixturing disparity is the double-up games, which have grown from five to six since the introduction of Gather Round. They are allocated with a model that was always flawed, based on a division of the top six, middle six and bottom six. The Lions have been fixtured to play these teams twice this year: Collingwood, Geelong, Hawthorn, the Bulldogs, Gold Coast and the Swans; thus, they were given three teams from last year\u2019s top six (Swans, Cats, Hawks), two from the middle (Dogs and Collingwood) and one from the bottom six, (the Suns as the local rival). Geelong, who finished third last year, were allocated the Lions, GWS and Port Adelaide as their top-six trio for two meetings, were gifted Essendon and St Kilda from the middle-six tier, and \u2013 inexplicably \u2013 Richmond from the six bottom. The best reflection of how the fixture has treated the Lions much worse is this: Geelong have lost twice to the Lions already, and twice to GWS, yet have at least an even money chance of finishing higher than the 2024 premiers.\n\nLoading Did everyone know that St Kilda and Essendon would be bottom six this year? Certainly, no one of sound mind had either team in their final eight. Those clubs\u2019 decisions to extend their senior coach\u2019s contracts this year underscored that they knew they were still mired in rebuild. Collingwood, for various reasons, finished ninth last year and are counted as \u201cmiddle third\u201d in the fixturing, despite winning the 2023 flag. They are a much harder ask for double-ups than Port Adelaide, who were fourth last year. Adelaide, meanwhile, are the beneficiary of a poor 2024 season, in which they fell from ninth \u2013 deprived of a finals berth by a goal umpiring blunder in 2023 \u2013 to the bottom six. Consequently, the Crows were handed the largesse of repeat encounters with West Coast and North Melbourne. The Crows could win the premiership this year after finishing 15th. As with Richmond in 2017 (premiers) and Collingwood in 2018 (lost the grand final by five points), they are gaining impetus from a previous poor season, which earned those clubs easier fixtures and momentum.\n\nThis year, there is a massive gap between getting the bottom three of 2024, compared to two games against Adelaide and Gold Coast.\n\nThe solution? The competition is already equalised by the draft, salary cap and soft cap. It is this column\u2019s unequivocal view that the fixture should not be a tool for equalisation. It is supposed to be a competition, after all, and there is little point talking about \u201cintegrity\u201d if the fixture is a handicap. Ideally, the top team, such as the Lions, ought to have a schedule that is no more taxing than the previous year\u2019s wooden spooner (Richmond).\n\nThis, as clubs know, is nigh impossible to achieve and, in fairness to Geelong, they were allocated repeat games against three teams from the 2024 top six \u2013 it\u2019s just that one of the teams, Port, didn\u2019t cut the mustard, and their middle six double-ups were poorer performers. The clubs contribute to the unfair fixturing since their desire to generate dollars and interest in games is afforded a higher priority than a level playing field. The fixture is primarily predicated on the AFL as an entertainment product. One way to create a fairer system is to divide the double-up games into six groups, based on the previous year\u2019s ladder, and ensure that every team is fixtured to play just one team from that one sixth of the ladder. So, everyone would get one of Richmond, North and West Coast twice, but no team would get two repeat meetings with the bottom three.",

        "text": "Three years after I lost Dan, I met Nick, a wonderful man who made space for the love I still have for my first husband. In the years that followed, we had our sons (now seven and five), but this isn\u2019t about a finish line or about equating happiness with finding love. It\u2019s about how you learn to live with the grief. For me, that means keeping Dan\u2019s photos around the house (the boys refer to him as \u2018Uncle Dan\u2019) and keeping his memory central to the work that I do. It wasn\u2019t the life I planned, but it\u2019s a beautiful one.\u201d \u2018We didn\u2019t have the tough conversations\u2019: Melissa Reader, 50 \u201cMauro was this gentle giant with beautiful corkscrew curls, but he was also full of personality without a hint of arrogance. We met in a dingy Darlinghurst [Sydney] bar in \u201997 and moved through all the major milestones quickly over the next few years. We started a business, got married, bought property and had three beautiful babies. With three kids under seven, life was busy, but it was wonderful. Melissa Reader wishes she and her late husband, Mauro, had more \u201ctough\u201d conversations before he died. Credit: It was only after our youngest was born that I realised Mauro wasn\u2019t quite his usual self. He\u2019d been complaining of constantly feeling unwell, but by the time he finally got around to getting things checked out, an ultrasound revealed a significant tumour in his kidney \u2013 advanced renal cancer. While Mauro went into treatment, I dived headfirst into logistics, juggling being the sole income earner with taking care of our children, but also remaining Mauro\u2019s wife and caregiver. I spent that first year of his 15-month battle lying awake at night, gripped with fear. It seems so obvious now that he was dying, but your brain plays tricks on you to allow you to cope.\n\nMauro died in intensive care during one of his many admissions over the final months. I don\u2019t remember much from that period \u2013 I was barely coping \u2013 but I remember thinking how sad it was that his death was so clinical, and how we never found the strength to have those difficult conversations like, \u2018How are you going to raise the children without me?\u2019, and, \u2018How will you organise the finances after I\u2019m gone?\u2019 Loading It was a couple of years after Mauro\u2019s death that I saw an opportunity to create Violet, a tech-enabled initiative that helps families talk about, plan for and manage the last chapters of life. At the same time, I met a wonderful man, Mark, who swooped in to love and care for a young family dealing with grief and trauma. I\u2019m a much braver person as a result of what I went through with Mauro \u2013 I take bigger risks, and I\u2019m far more decisive \u2013 but to be able to work on a legacy piece for Mauro? What a gift, and if I can help others navigate this space a little easier, well, that\u2019s even better.\u201d \u2018It was like someone took our world\u2019: Mitch Gibson, 61 \u201cI met Mark online and what was supposed to be a quick drink turned into seven dates in seven days. Mark was instantly likeable and we both knew straight away that this could be the start of something. We ended up having 17 years together, with Mark pouring his creative energy into producing theatre, a comedy festival and countless events in the arts and corporate sectors, while I ran my own yoga studio.\n\nMark was only 52 when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2018. Although he\u2019d experienced some niggly back pain for some time, nothing could have prepared us for the phone call that basically said, \u2018It\u2019s stage four; unfortunately you\u2019re not a candidate for surgery, good luck with everything.\u2019 It was like someone took our world, turned it upside down and shook it violently. I was already bearing the load of taking care of my elderly parents, and as Mark grew sicker, I had to sell my yoga studio. I just couldn\u2019t be everywhere at once. Mitch Reader lost her husband to cancer after 17 years together. Credit: The grief that hit me when Mark died in 2021 was staggering. Throughout his illness, I\u2019d been receiving psych support at Chris O\u2019Brien Lifehouse [in Sydney]; after his death it took me a year to find the right grief support. That year, alone in lockdown with this fresh grief, was brutal. I longed to speak with someone who\u2019d been through grief and really understood the isolation and disorientation. My friends did what they could to be there for me emotionally, though I still felt isolated within my grief. It\u2019s impossible to comprehend what you go through without lived experience. Curiously, while loved ones try to lift you out of your grief and this pain, a huge part of you wants to stay immersed in it; it\u2019s our connection to our lost person. My decision to become a counsellor specialising in grief and bereavement and caregiving felt purposeful after Mark\u2019s death. I know what it\u2019s like to be a carer at capacity and exhausted, and I know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019ve lost your person \u2013 and you\u2019d trade anything to revert to being at capacity and exhausted. Whenever I meet a new client, I can talk with them about what\u2019s happening with their person, discuss their main concerns and priorities, and get them moving forward rather than just spinning. Having been through it myself, I now understand you can never underestimate the importance of an experienced, empathetic ear and a guiding hand.\u201d",

        "text": "Even changes to the design to reduce costs \u2013 the Fed has removed some of the more ostentatious features of the original design \u2013 are being seized on by Republicans as evidence of unethical behaviour because what\u2019s being built is different to what Powell told Congress would be built. The faux angst about the management of the project is clearly a pretext. A recent US Supreme Court ruling made it clear that, unlike other government agencies, where Trump\u2019s authority to sack leaders and staff has been upheld, the Fed is different. Its chair can\u2019t be removed without cause. Trump is criticising Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell over the refurbishment of the Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve building in Washington, DC. Credit: Bloomberg Trump wanted to sack Powell during his first term, but discovered then that he didn\u2019t have that power. As is now the case, he clashed with Powell over the Fed\u2019s unwillingness to cut interest rates. He\u2019s been repeatedly calling for a three percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate (equivalent to the Reserve Bank\u2019s cash rate), even though the US inflation rate is well above the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target, at 2.7 per cent, and rising because of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nAfter three 25 basis point cuts last year, the Fed has left the target range for its policy rate at 4.25 to 4.5 per cent while it waits to see the full effects on inflation of Trump\u2019s barrage of tariffs. Trump may say that it\u2019s unlikely that he will fire Powell (while waving around a draft dismissal letter and canvassing congressmen and women for their opinions), but he\u2019s clearly fishing for grounds to do so. Powell has been adamant that he\u2019s going nowhere before his term as chair ends in May next year. The first inkling of what transpired within the White House on Tuesday came via a post on X by Republican congresswoman, Anna Luna, who was at the meeting. She posted, on Tuesday, that she was \u201chearing that Jerome Powell is getting fired. From a very serious source.\u201d\n\nThe rumours that an attempt to sack Powell might be underway rattled markets, with the sharemarket, longer-term bond prices and the US dollar all falling on Wednesday before recovering some of their ground after Trump\u2019s comments. That provides a directional insight into what might happen if Trump were to move against Powell \u2013 or replace him next year with someone clearly prepared to do what Trump wants. Most of the small group of those auditioning for the role, all Trump loyalists, are signalling (naturally, if they really want his endorsement) that they want lower rates. Trump\u2019s antics regarding Powell have markets on edge. Credit: AP On Wednesday, the sharemarket fell nearly a full percentage point before closing down 0.3 per cent for the day. The yields on short-term bonds fell, but those on longer-term bonds rose. Credit spreads widened. The US dollar weakened almost one percentage point against the currencies of America\u2019s major trading partners. That\u2019s a modest preview of what might be in store if Trump were to succeed in installing a loyalist in the Fed\u2019s chair.\n\nLowering rates while inflation is rising within a full-employment environment would be reckless policy, risking inflation. While sharemarket investors might like lower interest rates, and short-term bond yields would reflect a lower-rate environment, the increased inflation risk and the risk of stagflation would see longer-term bondholders demanding increased compensation for their longer exposure to those risks. Loading Trump and his advisers don\u2019t appear to appreciate the potential consequences of trying to replace Powell with a \u201cyes man.\u201d (All those being touted as chair are male). The markets trust the Fed to be independent of politics and political cycles, focusing purely on its twin mandate of price stability (controling inflation) and maximising employment. If that independence is threatened \u2013 if they think Trump or some future president can dictate monetary policies \u2013 there will be a scramble to exit financial markets. The dollar will dive, the sharemarket will fall and the yield curve will steepen significantly, with the yields on long-term bonds rising even as those on short-term securities fall. It is, given precedents elsewhere (Turkey and Hungary come to mind), likely that America\u2019s credit rating, once AAA, would be lowered again.\n\nThe Fed can provide the anchor for the yield curve and influence short-term rates, but market participants, a substantial proportion of them foreign, determine the shape of the yield curve and how much extra yield they want for the risk of holding bonds for five, or 10, or 30 years. Even a perception that the Fed\u2019s independence had been compromised would probably result in a significantly steeper yield curve \u2013 and higher interest rate on consumer and corporate debt. The market establishes those rates, not the Fed. The other problem for Trump is he tries to politicise the Fed and its decision-making is that there is no guarantee that a new chair would be able to impact rate decisions. Trump wanted to sack Powell during his first term, but discovered then that he didn\u2019t have that power. There are 12 members of the Open Market Committee that makes those decisions, so the chair \u2013 and the committee elects its own chair, which would be different, if they wished, to the chair of the board of governors \u2013 would have to convince a majority of them to do what he and/or Trump wants.",

Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe two pilots involved were Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and First Officer Clive Kunder, who had total flying experience of 15,638 hours and 3403 hours, respectively.\n\nIndia\u2019s AAIB, Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Boeing and Air India did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment on The Wall Street Journal report.\n\nA preliminary report into the crash released by India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday said the fuel switches had switched from run to cutoff a second apart just after take-off, but it did not say how they were flipped.\n\nLoading\n\nOne pilot was then heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel. \u201cThe other pilot responded that he did not do so,\u201d the report said.\n\nWithout fuel flowing to the engines, the London-bound plane began to lose thrust and sink. Almost immediately after the plane lifted off the ground, closed-circuit TV footage showed a back-up energy source called a ram air turbine had deployed, indicating a loss of power from the engines.\n\nAt the crash site, both fuel switches were found in the run position and there had been indications of both engines relighting before the low-altitude crash, the report said. In an internal memo on Monday, Air India chief executive Campbell Wilson said the preliminary report found no mechanical or maintenance faults and that all required maintenance had been carried out.\n\nThe AAIB\u2019s preliminary report had no safety recommendations for Boeing or engine manufacturer GE. After the report was released, the US Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing privately issued notifications that the fuel switch locks on Boeing planes are safe, a document seen by Reuters showed and four sources with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nReuters",

        "text": "The competition is yet to get off the ground and needs to hit three major triggers to secure the private equity and reported Saudi-Arabian funding to turn it into a reality. The first trigger is to have the franchises purchased and legally drafted. The second requires the confirmation of a broadcast partner, while the third element of the deal requires competition organisers to secure 200 players. All three targets must be reached by the end of September. Roger Tuivasa Sheck playing for the All Blacks in 2022. Credit: AP Sources with knowledge of the situation, talking on the condition of anonymity due to confidentiality agreements, said that there were close to 140 players committed to the competition. While Ponga hasn\u2019t been directly linked to R360, he has engaged New Zealand-based rugby union agent Kent Hale from Halo Sport to explore his options in the 15-man game.\n\nSharrock said the concept is a threat to the NRL with top-line players expected to earn US$2 million (A$3.1 million) per year. It\u2019s more than double what Ponga is earning ($1.4 million) in 2025 as the highest-paid player in the NRL. Kalyn Ponga is out injured for the remainder of the year. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI think it\u2019s something the NRL should be worried about with their dual-code players who would be capable of playing both codes at a high level,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re really looking at rugby players. Roger has appeal because he\u2019s already been a dual-coder. I think there\u2019s some rugby league players that could do it, and Kalyn Ponga is one of them. There\u2019ll be rugby league players who have attraction, but they won\u2019t have the eyes of the greater global rugby market.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, in France - where there is a huge rugby audience - who\u2019s Kalyn Ponga? He\u2019s known down here, but he\u2019s not known up there. The audience that are buying in are in the United States and Europe. In saying that, he will be a bloody good target. The money is significant.\u201d While rugby traditionalists and existing bodies and teams are opposed to the idea of the rebel competition, Sharrock has implored the game to rethink its future. \u201cIt\u2019s something rugby should really open its eyes to,\u201d Sharrock said. \u201cIf it does become something real, they need to all get around the table and reimagine what rugby union could look like globally. That\u2019s where I do see, not the threat, but the opportunity. If someone is willing to invest a lot of money into the game to re-energise it and reinvigorate it, I personally would be getting on the back of it and work out how to capitalise on it.\u201d\n\nTuivasa-Sheck\u2019s brother, Johnny, was only made aware of a potential code switch after being shown this masthead\u2019s report. \u201cOh, that\u2019s crazy, that\u2019s buzzing. Honestly, I\u2019m surprised. When he was playing rugby he was so keen to come back to the \u2019Wahs, if you watch him he likes that aggression, he likes to run it hard,\u201d said Johnny, a media personality who was capturing content for Stan at the Paul Gallen-Sonny Bill Williams fight. \u201cGoing back to rugby is a massive shock to me, but he will kill it.\u201d Former England rugby international Mike Tindall is the public face of R360. Tindall, who is married to British royal family member Zara Phillips, is in Australia to watch the British and Irish Lions tour. Loading\n\nThe R360 concept will follow a hybrid model of Formula 1 and the Indian Premier League, with private owners to invest in franchises around the world. The players who sign with R360 aren\u2019t signing for specific franchises but rather the competition itself, with the potential for auctions and drafts being floated. One model being discussed will see a joint Australia and New Zealand-based franchise as well as teams based in the United States, France, England, South America, Asia and South Africa in an eight-team competition that could grow to 12 teams. Competition organisers want to launch a one-off tournament next season, potentially from July to September, before adopting a regular format in 2027. The intended format in 2027 will see the competition split into two blocks, with the first half of the tournament played between March and May and the second stage played between September and December. That window is largely in competition with the NRL, which currently runs from March to October.",

Luckily I've just lost some skin,\" said the three-time champion.\n\n\n\nRider who caused crash apologises, 'terrified' of online abuse\n\nJohannessen, a Uno-X teammate of stage winner Abrahamsen, apologised for causing the crash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am terribly sorry for what happened,\" he wrote on X. \"I was trying to follow a move and I can see that I was too close,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I made a mistake ...

Why the hell did we ever drop it? That's the question,\" Henry said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It still boggles the mind that we had the world's best carbon policy. And then, for purely political reasons, decided that we can afford to do without it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe carbon tax, repealed by the Abbott government in July 2014, put a price on every tonne of pollution produced.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt hoped to incentivise businesses to adopt cleaner technologies and behaviours, otherwise forcing exporters and manufacturers to buy permits for their emissions.\n\n\n\nHenry supports raising taxes following leaked Treasury advice\n\nEarlier this week, the ABC reported leaked documents show Treasury has advised the government to raise taxes and cut spending after the election.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers attempted to downplay the advice, saying the heavily redacted document had not adequately captured the government's brief, which was already being focused on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm pretty relaxed about it, to be honest, because, of course, Treasury provides advice for incoming governments and no government typically goes into the detail of that,\" Chalmers said on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the suggestion mirrors advice by Treasury in a report published in 2010, which looked into Australian tax reform over a 10 to 20-year period, colloquially referred to as the Henry review.\n\n\n\n\"If the budget is to meet these growing spending pressures, then we've got two options. We either increase taxes, as a share of GDP, or we grow the economy faster,\" Henry told reporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe explained average productivity growth has slowed down from 2.31 per cent a year during the 1990s to an average of 0.98 per cent a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's a pretty fundamental difference, right. If we continue on that trajectory, as we said ... we will have no option but to raise taxes.\"\n\n\n\n",

Think of it as an 18-month-old, just learning to do everything again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHis mother Chelsea Blackwell remembers her shock on seeing the illness take hold of her son.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I actually couldn't comprehend what I'd seen. I opened the door, I looked and I was just like hmmm. Jacob didn't look like Jacob because his brain had already been swollen so his eyes were protruding and his skin was breaking a little bit. So they actually thought initially he had been assaulted.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeningococcal disease is caused by bacteria, called neisseria meningitidis, which most people carry in the back of their throat at some point in their lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when that bacteria turns invasive it can enter the brain or the bloodstream, causing potentially life-threatening infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Practitioner Dr Sam Hay says the disease can progress dangerously quickly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It often starts with a flu-like illness, bit of a cold, bit of a runny nose, a bit of a cough. But then it progresses, fevers and (the patient) becomes very, very sick after that. People can go downhill within 24 to 48 hours.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Australia enters peak season for meningococcal, there's a national campaign ((launched Monday)) to raise awareness of the disease which primarily affects young adults and children.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctors say the illness is on the rise, with 56 cases already reported this year - 18 of those in New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sam Hay says infections can have devastating consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One in 10 people who get the invasive meningococcal can unfortunately pass away. One in five get these significant side-effects, complications, that could be brain damage, loss of limbs, hearing loss, and the list goes on.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nParalympic swimmer and bronze medallist Jay Dohnt contracted meningococcal when he was in high school.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter feeling sick and developing a rash, he went to see a GP.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust 24 hours after developing symptoms, he was in intensive care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The ambulance was still in precautionary mode, they didn't even put the lights on to take me to a hospital. At the hospital, it was a different story. They all met me out in the carpark, and took it very seriously. That evening (I was) hooked up to everything in the intensive care unit and given a 97 per chance of dying, or a 3 per cent chance of living. I wasn't conscious for the first two weeks, and I don't remember much from the first two months of a five-and-a-half month hospital stay. But this is essentially the end result - a bilateral knee amputee. Missing my patella (kneecap) in my left leg, lost four fingers on my right hand as well. So very life-changing for a teenager who loved sport.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's these life-altering impacts that lead Karen Quick, CEO of Meningitis Centre Australia, to stress the importance of early detection, urging parents to push for answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's really important as parents that we're aware of all the signs and symptoms, that we trust our instincts and we get help straight away. Go straight to the hospital, straight to the doctor, and ask the question - could it be meningococcal?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sam Hay warns people not to wait until they have developed a rash as by then, it could be already too late.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When it gets into the blood stream, that's when you get the septicaemia and that then goes on to the rash. But the problem is that the rash, while it is dangerous, it happens late. And if you are looking for that, things have gone too far.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo years after his brush with meningococcal, Jay Blackwell is still working on his recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nInspired by Paralympian and fellow survivor Jay, he has taken up swimming and says, despite many challenges, the future is looking bright.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "That\u2019s three top-eight teams, two of the bottom three, plus Port. Crucially, the Crows have their tougher opponents \u2013 the Suns, Hawks and Pies \u2013 all at Adelaide Oval. Assuming they maintain form, there\u2019s a fair chance the Crows, who have 12 wins, will finish top two; certainly, they have better prospects, based on their final six games, of winning 17 games than the Lions (who have 12\u00bd).\n\nThe problem The Lions\u2019 tough run home wouldn\u2019t be unjust if it was the result of fixturing swings and roundabouts, and it\u2019s true that Geelong have already played and beaten Collingwood, Adelaide, Gold Coast, Hawthorn and Fremantle \u2013 the Cats, to a degree, did the harder yards early.\n\nThe primary cause of the fixturing disparity is the double-up games, which have grown from five to six since the introduction of Gather Round. They are allocated with a model that was always flawed, based on a division of the top six, middle six and bottom six. The Lions have been fixtured to play these teams twice this year: Collingwood, Geelong, Hawthorn, the Bulldogs, Gold Coast and the Swans; thus, they were given three teams from last year\u2019s top six (Swans, Cats, Hawks), two from the middle (Dogs and Collingwood) and one from the bottom six, (the Suns as the local rival). Geelong, who finished third last year, were allocated the Lions, GWS and Port Adelaide as their top-six trio for two meetings, were gifted Essendon and St Kilda from the middle-six tier, and \u2013 inexplicably \u2013 Richmond from the six bottom. The best reflection of how the fixture has treated the Lions much worse is this: Geelong have lost twice to the Lions already, and twice to GWS, yet have at least an even money chance of finishing higher than the 2024 premiers.\n\nLoading Did everyone know that St Kilda and Essendon would be bottom six this year? Certainly, no one of sound mind had either team in their final eight. Those clubs\u2019 decisions to extend their senior coach\u2019s contracts this year underscored that they knew they were still mired in rebuild. Collingwood, for various reasons, finished ninth last year and are counted as \u201cmiddle third\u201d in the fixturing, despite winning the 2023 flag. They are a much harder ask for double-ups than Port Adelaide, who were fourth last year. Adelaide, meanwhile, are the beneficiary of a poor 2024 season, in which they fell from ninth \u2013 deprived of a finals berth by a goal umpiring blunder in 2023 \u2013 to the bottom six. Consequently, the Crows were handed the largesse of repeat encounters with West Coast and North Melbourne. The Crows could win the premiership this year after finishing 15th. As with Richmond in 2017 (premiers) and Collingwood in 2018 (lost the grand final by five points), they are gaining impetus from a previous poor season, which earned those clubs easier fixtures and momentum.\n\nThis year, there is a massive gap between getting the bottom three of 2024, compared to two games against Adelaide and Gold Coast.\n\nThe solution? The competition is already equalised by the draft, salary cap and soft cap. It is this column\u2019s unequivocal view that the fixture should not be a tool for equalisation. It is supposed to be a competition, after all, and there is little point talking about \u201cintegrity\u201d if the fixture is a handicap. Ideally, the top team, such as the Lions, ought to have a schedule that is no more taxing than the previous year\u2019s wooden spooner (Richmond).\n\nThis, as clubs know, is nigh impossible to achieve and, in fairness to Geelong, they were allocated repeat games against three teams from the 2024 top six \u2013 it\u2019s just that one of the teams, Port, didn\u2019t cut the mustard, and their middle six double-ups were poorer performers. The clubs contribute to the unfair fixturing since their desire to generate dollars and interest in games is afforded a higher priority than a level playing field. The fixture is primarily predicated on the AFL as an entertainment product. One way to create a fairer system is to divide the double-up games into six groups, based on the previous year\u2019s ladder, and ensure that every team is fixtured to play just one team from that one sixth of the ladder. So, everyone would get one of Richmond, North and West Coast twice, but no team would get two repeat meetings with the bottom three.",

        "text": "Three years after I lost Dan, I met Nick, a wonderful man who made space for the love I still have for my first husband. In the years that followed, we had our sons (now seven and five), but this isn\u2019t about a finish line or about equating happiness with finding love. It\u2019s about how you learn to live with the grief. For me, that means keeping Dan\u2019s photos around the house (the boys refer to him as \u2018Uncle Dan\u2019) and keeping his memory central to the work that I do. It wasn\u2019t the life I planned, but it\u2019s a beautiful one.\u201d \u2018We didn\u2019t have the tough conversations\u2019: Melissa Reader, 50 \u201cMauro was this gentle giant with beautiful corkscrew curls, but he was also full of personality without a hint of arrogance. We met in a dingy Darlinghurst [Sydney] bar in \u201997 and moved through all the major milestones quickly over the next few years. We started a business, got married, bought property and had three beautiful babies. With three kids under seven, life was busy, but it was wonderful. Melissa Reader wishes she and her late husband, Mauro, had more \u201ctough\u201d conversations before he died. Credit: It was only after our youngest was born that I realised Mauro wasn\u2019t quite his usual self. He\u2019d been complaining of constantly feeling unwell, but by the time he finally got around to getting things checked out, an ultrasound revealed a significant tumour in his kidney \u2013 advanced renal cancer. While Mauro went into treatment, I dived headfirst into logistics, juggling being the sole income earner with taking care of our children, but also remaining Mauro\u2019s wife and caregiver. I spent that first year of his 15-month battle lying awake at night, gripped with fear. It seems so obvious now that he was dying, but your brain plays tricks on you to allow you to cope.\n\nMauro died in intensive care during one of his many admissions over the final months. I don\u2019t remember much from that period \u2013 I was barely coping \u2013 but I remember thinking how sad it was that his death was so clinical, and how we never found the strength to have those difficult conversations like, \u2018How are you going to raise the children without me?\u2019, and, \u2018How will you organise the finances after I\u2019m gone?\u2019 Loading It was a couple of years after Mauro\u2019s death that I saw an opportunity to create Violet, a tech-enabled initiative that helps families talk about, plan for and manage the last chapters of life. At the same time, I met a wonderful man, Mark, who swooped in to love and care for a young family dealing with grief and trauma. I\u2019m a much braver person as a result of what I went through with Mauro \u2013 I take bigger risks, and I\u2019m far more decisive \u2013 but to be able to work on a legacy piece for Mauro? What a gift, and if I can help others navigate this space a little easier, well, that\u2019s even better.\u201d \u2018It was like someone took our world\u2019: Mitch Gibson, 61 \u201cI met Mark online and what was supposed to be a quick drink turned into seven dates in seven days. Mark was instantly likeable and we both knew straight away that this could be the start of something. We ended up having 17 years together, with Mark pouring his creative energy into producing theatre, a comedy festival and countless events in the arts and corporate sectors, while I ran my own yoga studio.\n\nMark was only 52 when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2018. Although he\u2019d experienced some niggly back pain for some time, nothing could have prepared us for the phone call that basically said, \u2018It\u2019s stage four; unfortunately you\u2019re not a candidate for surgery, good luck with everything.\u2019 It was like someone took our world, turned it upside down and shook it violently. I was already bearing the load of taking care of my elderly parents, and as Mark grew sicker, I had to sell my yoga studio. I just couldn\u2019t be everywhere at once. Mitch Reader lost her husband to cancer after 17 years together. Credit: The grief that hit me when Mark died in 2021 was staggering. Throughout his illness, I\u2019d been receiving psych support at Chris O\u2019Brien Lifehouse [in Sydney]; after his death it took me a year to find the right grief support. That year, alone in lockdown with this fresh grief, was brutal. I longed to speak with someone who\u2019d been through grief and really understood the isolation and disorientation. My friends did what they could to be there for me emotionally, though I still felt isolated within my grief. It\u2019s impossible to comprehend what you go through without lived experience. Curiously, while loved ones try to lift you out of your grief and this pain, a huge part of you wants to stay immersed in it; it\u2019s our connection to our lost person. My decision to become a counsellor specialising in grief and bereavement and caregiving felt purposeful after Mark\u2019s death. I know what it\u2019s like to be a carer at capacity and exhausted, and I know what it\u2019s like when you\u2019ve lost your person \u2013 and you\u2019d trade anything to revert to being at capacity and exhausted. Whenever I meet a new client, I can talk with them about what\u2019s happening with their person, discuss their main concerns and priorities, and get them moving forward rather than just spinning. Having been through it myself, I now understand you can never underestimate the importance of an experienced, empathetic ear and a guiding hand.\u201d",

        "text": "Even changes to the design to reduce costs \u2013 the Fed has removed some of the more ostentatious features of the original design \u2013 are being seized on by Republicans as evidence of unethical behaviour because what\u2019s being built is different to what Powell told Congress would be built. The faux angst about the management of the project is clearly a pretext. A recent US Supreme Court ruling made it clear that, unlike other government agencies, where Trump\u2019s authority to sack leaders and staff has been upheld, the Fed is different. Its chair can\u2019t be removed without cause. Trump is criticising Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell over the refurbishment of the Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve building in Washington, DC. Credit: Bloomberg Trump wanted to sack Powell during his first term, but discovered then that he didn\u2019t have that power. As is now the case, he clashed with Powell over the Fed\u2019s unwillingness to cut interest rates. He\u2019s been repeatedly calling for a three percentage point reduction in the federal funds rate (equivalent to the Reserve Bank\u2019s cash rate), even though the US inflation rate is well above the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent target, at 2.7 per cent, and rising because of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nAfter three 25 basis point cuts last year, the Fed has left the target range for its policy rate at 4.25 to 4.5 per cent while it waits to see the full effects on inflation of Trump\u2019s barrage of tariffs. Trump may say that it\u2019s unlikely that he will fire Powell (while waving around a draft dismissal letter and canvassing congressmen and women for their opinions), but he\u2019s clearly fishing for grounds to do so. Powell has been adamant that he\u2019s going nowhere before his term as chair ends in May next year. The first inkling of what transpired within the White House on Tuesday came via a post on X by Republican congresswoman, Anna Luna, who was at the meeting. She posted, on Tuesday, that she was \u201chearing that Jerome Powell is getting fired. From a very serious source.\u201d\n\nThe rumours that an attempt to sack Powell might be underway rattled markets, with the sharemarket, longer-term bond prices and the US dollar all falling on Wednesday before recovering some of their ground after Trump\u2019s comments. That provides a directional insight into what might happen if Trump were to move against Powell \u2013 or replace him next year with someone clearly prepared to do what Trump wants. Most of the small group of those auditioning for the role, all Trump loyalists, are signalling (naturally, if they really want his endorsement) that they want lower rates. Trump\u2019s antics regarding Powell have markets on edge. Credit: AP On Wednesday, the sharemarket fell nearly a full percentage point before closing down 0.3 per cent for the day. The yields on short-term bonds fell, but those on longer-term bonds rose. Credit spreads widened. The US dollar weakened almost one percentage point against the currencies of America\u2019s major trading partners. That\u2019s a modest preview of what might be in store if Trump were to succeed in installing a loyalist in the Fed\u2019s chair.\n\nLowering rates while inflation is rising within a full-employment environment would be reckless policy, risking inflation. While sharemarket investors might like lower interest rates, and short-term bond yields would reflect a lower-rate environment, the increased inflation risk and the risk of stagflation would see longer-term bondholders demanding increased compensation for their longer exposure to those risks. Loading Trump and his advisers don\u2019t appear to appreciate the potential consequences of trying to replace Powell with a \u201cyes man.\u201d (All those being touted as chair are male). The markets trust the Fed to be independent of politics and political cycles, focusing purely on its twin mandate of price stability (controling inflation) and maximising employment. If that independence is threatened \u2013 if they think Trump or some future president can dictate monetary policies \u2013 there will be a scramble to exit financial markets. The dollar will dive, the sharemarket will fall and the yield curve will steepen significantly, with the yields on long-term bonds rising even as those on short-term securities fall. It is, given precedents elsewhere (Turkey and Hungary come to mind), likely that America\u2019s credit rating, once AAA, would be lowered again.\n\nThe Fed can provide the anchor for the yield curve and influence short-term rates, but market participants, a substantial proportion of them foreign, determine the shape of the yield curve and how much extra yield they want for the risk of holding bonds for five, or 10, or 30 years. Even a perception that the Fed\u2019s independence had been compromised would probably result in a significantly steeper yield curve \u2013 and higher interest rate on consumer and corporate debt. The market establishes those rates, not the Fed. The other problem for Trump is he tries to politicise the Fed and its decision-making is that there is no guarantee that a new chair would be able to impact rate decisions. Trump wanted to sack Powell during his first term, but discovered then that he didn\u2019t have that power. There are 12 members of the Open Market Committee that makes those decisions, so the chair \u2013 and the committee elects its own chair, which would be different, if they wished, to the chair of the board of governors \u2013 would have to convince a majority of them to do what he and/or Trump wants.",

Twists on classic desserts include the orange and filo cake portokalopita, served with an ice-cream of anthotyro cheese and olive oil. A melding of bougatsa and diples \u2013 fried, honey-dipped sheets of dough \u2013 results in a hybrid dish akin to millefeuille.

Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe two pilots involved were Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and First Officer Clive Kunder, who had total flying experience of 15,638 hours and 3403 hours, respectively.\n\nIndia\u2019s AAIB, Directorate General of Civil Aviation, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Boeing and Air India did not immediately respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment on The Wall Street Journal report.\n\nA preliminary report into the crash released by India\u2019s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) on Saturday said the fuel switches had switched from run to cutoff a second apart just after take-off, but it did not say how they were flipped.\n\nLoading\n\nOne pilot was then heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel. \u201cThe other pilot responded that he did not do so,\u201d the report said.\n\nWithout fuel flowing to the engines, the London-bound plane began to lose thrust and sink. Almost immediately after the plane lifted off the ground, closed-circuit TV footage showed a back-up energy source called a ram air turbine had deployed, indicating a loss of power from the engines.\n\nAt the crash site, both fuel switches were found in the run position and there had been indications of both engines relighting before the low-altitude crash, the report said. In an internal memo on Monday, Air India chief executive Campbell Wilson said the preliminary report found no mechanical or maintenance faults and that all required maintenance had been carried out.\n\nThe AAIB\u2019s preliminary report had no safety recommendations for Boeing or engine manufacturer GE. After the report was released, the US Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing privately issued notifications that the fuel switch locks on Boeing planes are safe, a document seen by Reuters showed and four sources with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nReuters",

        "text": "The competition is yet to get off the ground and needs to hit three major triggers to secure the private equity and reported Saudi-Arabian funding to turn it into a reality. The first trigger is to have the franchises purchased and legally drafted. The second requires the confirmation of a broadcast partner, while the third element of the deal requires competition organisers to secure 200 players. All three targets must be reached by the end of September. Roger Tuivasa Sheck playing for the All Blacks in 2022. Credit: AP Sources with knowledge of the situation, talking on the condition of anonymity due to confidentiality agreements, said that there were close to 140 players committed to the competition. While Ponga hasn\u2019t been directly linked to R360, he has engaged New Zealand-based rugby union agent Kent Hale from Halo Sport to explore his options in the 15-man game.\n\nSharrock said the concept is a threat to the NRL with top-line players expected to earn US$2 million (A$3.1 million) per year. It\u2019s more than double what Ponga is earning ($1.4 million) in 2025 as the highest-paid player in the NRL. Kalyn Ponga is out injured for the remainder of the year. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI think it\u2019s something the NRL should be worried about with their dual-code players who would be capable of playing both codes at a high level,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re really looking at rugby players. Roger has appeal because he\u2019s already been a dual-coder. I think there\u2019s some rugby league players that could do it, and Kalyn Ponga is one of them. There\u2019ll be rugby league players who have attraction, but they won\u2019t have the eyes of the greater global rugby market.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it, in France - where there is a huge rugby audience - who\u2019s Kalyn Ponga? He\u2019s known down here, but he\u2019s not known up there. The audience that are buying in are in the United States and Europe. In saying that, he will be a bloody good target. The money is significant.\u201d While rugby traditionalists and existing bodies and teams are opposed to the idea of the rebel competition, Sharrock has implored the game to rethink its future. \u201cIt\u2019s something rugby should really open its eyes to,\u201d Sharrock said. \u201cIf it does become something real, they need to all get around the table and reimagine what rugby union could look like globally. That\u2019s where I do see, not the threat, but the opportunity. If someone is willing to invest a lot of money into the game to re-energise it and reinvigorate it, I personally would be getting on the back of it and work out how to capitalise on it.\u201d\n\nTuivasa-Sheck\u2019s brother, Johnny, was only made aware of a potential code switch after being shown this masthead\u2019s report. \u201cOh, that\u2019s crazy, that\u2019s buzzing. Honestly, I\u2019m surprised. When he was playing rugby he was so keen to come back to the \u2019Wahs, if you watch him he likes that aggression, he likes to run it hard,\u201d said Johnny, a media personality who was capturing content for Stan at the Paul Gallen-Sonny Bill Williams fight. \u201cGoing back to rugby is a massive shock to me, but he will kill it.\u201d Former England rugby international Mike Tindall is the public face of R360. Tindall, who is married to British royal family member Zara Phillips, is in Australia to watch the British and Irish Lions tour. Loading\n\nThe R360 concept will follow a hybrid model of Formula 1 and the Indian Premier League, with private owners to invest in franchises around the world. The players who sign with R360 aren\u2019t signing for specific franchises but rather the competition itself, with the potential for auctions and drafts being floated. One model being discussed will see a joint Australia and New Zealand-based franchise as well as teams based in the United States, France, England, South America, Asia and South Africa in an eight-team competition that could grow to 12 teams. Competition organisers want to launch a one-off tournament next season, potentially from July to September, before adopting a regular format in 2027. The intended format in 2027 will see the competition split into two blocks, with the first half of the tournament played between March and May and the second stage played between September and December. That window is largely in competition with the NRL, which currently runs from March to October.",
