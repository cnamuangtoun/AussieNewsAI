        "text": "A Florida federal judge on Friday tossed out a $22.7 billion defamation lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump against The New York Times .\n\nUS District Judge Steven Merryday ruled that Trump's 85-page lawsuit was overly long and full of \"tedious and burdensome\" language that had no bearing on the legal case. The judge gave Trump 28 days to file an amended complaint that should not exceed 40 pages.\n\n\"A complaint is not a megaphone for public relations or a podium for a passionate oration at a political rally,\" Merryday wrote in a four-page order. \"This action will begin, will continue, and will end in accord with the rules of procedure and in a professional and dignified manner.\"\n\nDonald Trump's lawsuit against the New York Times has been slapped down by a judge days after it was filed. (AP)\n\nTrump's legal team plans to continue the lawsuit \"in accordance with the judge's direction on logistics,\" spokesman Aaron Harison said.\n\nThe lawsuit named four Times journalists and cited a book and three articles published within a two-month period before the last election.\n\nThe Times had said it was meritless and an attempt to discourage independent reporting. \"We welcome the judge's quick ruling, which recognised that the complaint was a political document rather than a serious legal filing,\" spokesman Charlie Stadtlander said Friday.\n\nMerryday noted that the lawsuit did not get to the first defamation count until page 80. The lawsuit delves into Trump's work on The Apprentice TV show and an \"extensive list\" of Trump's other media appearances.\n\n\"As every lawyer knows (or is presumed to know), a complaint is not a public forum for vituperation and invective \u2014 not a protected platform to rage against an adversary,\" wrote Merryday, an appointment of former President George H.W. Bush. \"Although lawyers receive a modicum of expressive latitude in pleading the claim of a client, the complaint in this action extends far beyond the outer bound of that latitude.\"\n\nThe lawsuit named a book and an article written by Times reporters Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig that focuses on Trump's finances and his pre-presidency role in \"The Apprentice.\" Trump said in the lawsuit that they \"maliciously peddled the fact-free narrative\" that television producer Mark Burnett turned Trump into a celebrity \u2014 \"even though at and prior to the time of publications defendants knew that President Trump was already a mega-celebrity and an enormous success in business.\"\n\nA judge said Donald Trump's lawsuit against the New York Times was full of \"tedious and burdensome\" language. (AP)\n\nThe lawsuit also attacked claims the reporters made about Trump's early business dealings and his father, Fred.\n\nTrump also cited an article by Peter Baker last October 20 headlined \"For Trump, a Lifetime of Scandals Heads Toward a Moment of Judgement.\" He also sued Michael S. Schmidt for a piece two days later featuring an interview with Trump's first-term chief of staff, John Kelly, headlined \"As Election Nears, Kelly Warns Trump Would Rule Like a Dictator.\"\n\nTrump has also sued ABC News and CBS News' 60 Minutes , both of which were settled out of court by the news organisations' parent companies. Trump also sued The Wall Street Journal and media mogul Rupert Murdoch in July after the newspaper published a story reporting on his ties to wealthy financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

        "text": "A new report has painted a grim picture of life in Australia, revealing a nation where people are feeling lonelier than ever, pay more tax and are delaying their dreams.\n\nThe Melbourne Institute's annual Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, which has tracked the lives of thousands of Australians since 2001, released its 2025 report today.\n\nIt highlights how everything from rising living costs to the erosion of social networks is taking a toll on the nation's well-being.\n\nAustralians are lonelier than ever, paying more tax and wanting fewer children, a new survey has found. (iStock)\n\nWe have fewer friends\n\nThe survey found that our social connections are weakening, a trend exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAustralians are reporting fewer friends and less frequent socialising than at the turn of the century.\n\n\"Not only do we feel like we have fewer friends, but we're also socialising less frequently than in 2001,\" senior research fellow and report co-author Dr Inga Lass said.\n\nThe proportion of people meeting friends or relatives several times a week or more has dropped by over 12 percentage points, from about 32 per cent to just 20 per cent.\n\nThis decline in social connection has potential implications for our overall well-being.\n\nThe survey also found that a majority of Australians now report experiencing bodily pain, a trend that has worsened since 2001, even when accounting for the nation's ageing population.\n\nPeople in lower-income households were also more likely to report experiencing pain, co-author Dr Ferdi Botha said.\n\n\"The less money you make, the more pain you're likely putting up with,\" Botha said.\n\nThe hidden tax of inflation\n\nThe survey revealed that Australians are paying the highest average income tax rate since the study began in 2001.\n\nThis is not due to a change in policy but rather to \"bracket creep\".\n\nAs wages have risen to keep pace with inflation, many workers have been pushed into higher tax brackets, effectively reducing their real purchasing power.\n\nProfessor Roger Wilkins explained that while wage growth is normally a good thing, a combination of bracket creep and rapidly rising prices has contributed to a decline in workers' living standards in recent years.\n\nSydney's Hyde Park at dusk. Life in Australia is becoming more expensive and we are paying more tax. (iStock)\n\nThis phenomenon affects middle-income earners more significantly than high-income earners.\n\nWilkins also highlighted a reversal in household spending patterns.\n\nPrior to 2021, Australians were spending less on necessities.\n\nHowever, the recent cost-of-living crisis undid that progress, with the total proportion of income spent on necessities jumping by 4.5 per cent between 2021 and 2023.\n\nEconomic pressures reshape family and work\n\nThe report also sheds light on how economic pressures are influencing our biggest life decisions.\n\nFor the first time, the average number of children men want has fallen below two.\n\nWhile having two children remained the most common wish, there's a notable increase in the number of people, both men and women, who now want only one child, or none at all.\n\nLass attributed this to potential parents growing \"more concerned about their financial security and the costs of raising a child.\"\n\nFinally, the notion of retiring in your early 60s is fast becoming a thing of the past.\n\nThe proportion of women aged 60-64 who are retired has plunged from 70 per cent in 2003 to just 41 per cent in 2023.\n\nFor men in the same age bracket, the retirement rate has fallen from 49 per cent to a low of 27 per cent.\n\nWhile some are choosing to work longer, the survey points to a more unsettling trend for many.\n\nThe number of retirees living in private rentals has doubled in two decades, facing significant financial strain as average annual rent payments have surged by 37 per cent in real terms.",

He fought the ticket at the Disputes Tribunal and won. (Chris Skelton/Stuff)\n\nHe appealed to the company to waive the breach notice, but that was dismissed.\n\nWith the help of ChatGPT, he fought the decision at the Disputes Tribunal, and won.\n\nSmith said he thought the charges were \"obscene\" and the company was being \"predatory\".\n\nREAD MORE: Doctor who blew whistle on mushroom murderer sanctioned by medical regulator \ufeff\n\nSigns displayed outside the laundromat outline the car park terms and conditions.

(Supplied: Keely McDonald)\n\n'Lack of support'\n\nIn Victoria, the Department of Environment, Energy and Climate Action (DEECA) grants licences for registered beekeepers to place their hives on public land.\n\nDEECA's apiculture on public land policy was introduced in 2014 to encourage beekeeping in the state's forests, parks and reserves.\n\nBut Peter McDonald, owner of McDonald Honey in Castlemaine and president of the Victorian Farmers Federation\u2019s beekeeper branch, said the department was not following its own policy.\n\n\"It seems like there's a general lack of support for beekeeping on public land across the state,\" he said.\n\nPeter McDonald says beekeepers are under pressure from a \"lack of support\" during an already difficult time. (Supplied: Keely McDonald)\n\nMr McDonald said there had been years-long delays in licence application processing, some beekeepers had been denied new licences and existing ones were not renewed when they lapsed.\n\n\"It's extra pressure we don't need when we're going through one of the toughest times for the industry in my lifetime,\" he said.\n\nHoney bees feed off crops in the spring and provide critical pollination services, particularly in the almond industry.\n\nBut outside of these times, public land was \"vital\", Mr McDonald said.\n\n\"For the rest of the year we've got to keep them fed and healthy and that's through the native forests, so it is the majority of the food source for our bees,\" he said.\n\n\"Seventy to 80 per cent of our honey gets produced on public land.\"\n\nEuropean honey bees provide critical pollination services to the almond industry.

(Supplied: Keely McDonald)\n\nMs McDonald said she was worried the same would happen at other sites, describing it as a \"concerning precedent\".\n\n\"If more and more parks are shut off, young farmers like me won't have a future in beekeeping, and that affects the whole food system,\" she said.\n\nGovernment 'supports beekeeping on public land'\n\nA Victorian government spokesperson said apiary licences on public land would continue to be issued and that Wilsons Promontory National Park was still open to beekeepers, with \"a number of active beekeeping licences\".\n\n\"DEECA seeks to encourage and support beekeeping on public land except wilderness and reference areas,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\" New applications are assessed on a case-by-case basis to safeguard the national park and its exceptional conservation values. \"\n\nA spokesperson for Parks Victoria said it was still granting licences to beekeepers.\n\n\"There is no formal policy not to grant new apiary licences in Wilsons Prom National Park,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"A new licence was granted last year.\n\n\"However, the high conservation value of the park, existing licence areas and visitor sites mean the scope for new applications is limited.\"\n\nA Parks Victoria spokesperson says there is no formal policy not to grant new licences in the national park.

        "text": "Canada has ended New Zealand's decade of dominance at the Women's Rugby World Cup \u2014 conjuring a 34-19 victory over the Black Ferns to reach the final and inflict a first defeat in the tournament on the double-defending champions since 2014.\n\nJustine Pelletier, Asia Hogan-Rochester, Florence Symonds, and Sophie de Goede crossed for Canada in a stunning first-half performance, and Alex Tessier added another try after the break to extend what was already a healthy lead.\n\nWomen's Rugby World Cup Champions 1991: United States\n\n1994: England\n\n1998: New Zealand\n\n2002: New Zealand\n\n2006: New Zealand\n\n2010: New Zealand\n\n2014: England\n\n2017: New Zealand\n\n2021: New Zealand\n\n2025: * *To be determined\n\nSix-time champions New Zealand produced a spirited fightback in the second half but could not prevent the Canadians reaching their second World Cup final after losing to England 11 years ago.\n\nIt was New Zealand's first World Cup semifinal defeat since 1991, with Canada now eagerly awaiting the winners of Sunday morning's second semifinal between England and France for the decider at Twickenham in a week's time.\n\n\"I'm excited already,\" said Canada coach Kevin Rouet. \"I said to the girls to stop crying because we have a job to do in eight days. That's the mindset. We need to finish the job and be ready in eight days.\"\n\nRanked second in the world and one place above New Zealand, Canada was hardly underdogs, but its opponent's record spoke for itself, and when it came to the hardened business of winning World Cup semifinals, the southern hemisphere team is in a different league.\n\nThis was its eighth semifinal, and it had won the previous six, while Canada, by contrast, had lost all but one of its previous five last-four encounters.\n\nThe Canucks are an amateur side that launched a successful one million Canadian dollars ($1.1 million) fundraising drive in March \u2014 titled Mission: Win Rugby World Cup \u2014 to crowdfund their tournament.\n\nIf the Canadians were intimidated by the Kiwis' World Cup pedigree, they certainly did not show it as they took the match by the scruff of the neck with a devastating first-half display.\n\nThey scored their first try in the eighth minute when Alysha Corrigan played it inside to Pelletier, who sold a dummy, jinked back, and touched down.\n\nThree minutes later, there was clear daylight between the sides as a long pass out to the wing found Hogan-Rochester, who shrugged off the tackle of New Zealand fullback Renee Holmes and crossed in the corner.\n\nCanada extended its lead again in the 24th minute, laying siege to the New Zealand line, before the ball was thrown wide for Symonds to cross.\n\nThat seemed to jolt the Black Ferns awake, and their first period of pressure ended with Tanya Kalounivale picking the ball up and bundling over from close range to reduce the deficit.\n\nYet seemingly stung by their opponents' riposte, the Canadians crossed again before the break as Pelletier fed De Goede inside, and she galloped over from 25 metres out and added the extras to send her side in 24-7 up at the break.\n\nThree minutes after the restart, Canada put its foot back on the throttle with a fifth try, as Tessier cut back and slid over, after an attack down the left was held up.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nThe contest, however, was reignited when Liana Mikaele-Tu'u drove over the line after a spell of New Zealand pressure, and when Sorensen-McGee collected Ruahei Demant's chip kick to the corner and touched down to reduce the deficit to 31-19 with 15 minutes remaining, it was game on.\n\nIt was swiftly game over, however, as a De Goede penalty calmed Canadian jitters, putting them more than two converted tries clear, a lead they were never going to relinquish.\n\n\"They were exceptional and it will be a great final,\" said New Zealand captain Kennedy Tukuafu.\n\n\"I think how far the women's game has come, it's pretty special to be part of this legacy, to see how big this tournament's been, the biggest there's ever been, so we can be proud of contributing to that.\"\n\nReuters/ABC",

(ABC North and West: Declan Durrant)\n\nLast month, Mr Roberts honoured that partnership by naming the forest track after Dr Nicolle and opening it to the public.\n\nThe 4.4-kilometre signposted botanical trail features more than 2,000 Australian plant species, including 300 varieties of rare eucalypt, many of them almost unheard of in South Australia.\n\nThe trail stands as testament to a unique deal between a botanist and a painter \u2014 and the forest and friendship it spawned.\n\nBig things grow\n\nThough the inspiration for the forest rail trail could be traced back to the men's respective childhoods when both discovered a passion for eucalypts, it was in 1995 when they first met.\n\nMr Roberts began purchasing eucalypt seeds from Dr Nicolle, whom he had met through the arboreal community.\n\nAs Mr Roberts put it, they \"were both gum nuts\".\n\nHe purchased seeds from the botanist for the next decade, growing them to recreate the trees in his paintings.\n\nThen in 2006, Mr Roberts asked Dr Nicolle for a better price.\n\nThe scientist offered the painter a deal \u2014 he would gift Mr Roberts 12 seeds to grow into seedlings, but only if he got back eight of the sprouts, and Mr Roberts could keep the difference.\n\nMr Roberts spoke at the opening of the walk. (ABC North and West: Declan Durrant)\n\n\"Of course I said I was happy with that,\" Mr Roberts said.\n\n\"I love growing things.\"\n\nDr Nicolle gave Mr Roberts access to his entire collection, which consisted of 3,000 vials of seed.\n\nFor the next four years, Mr Roberts grew them at a property near Clare, with his share either becoming models for his painting or being sold to other enthusiasts.\n\nMr Roberts also began to paint renderings of all 900 species of eucalypt.\n\nHe has completed watercolours of some 770.\n\nMr Roberts has painted about 770 watercolours of the eucalyptus trees. (ABC North and West: Declan Durrant)\n\nMeanwhile, Dr Nicolle re-planted his at Currency Creek, in south east SA, on a 30-hectare arboretum.\n\nHis collection is considered the largest eucalypt arboretum in the world, containing almost every known variant of the species.\n\n\"That's how the collaboration's worked, and we've been going hammer and tongs ever since,\" he said.\n\nMajor planting\n\nMr Roberts was confronted with a singular problem in 2011 \u2014 he ran out of places to plant.\n\nBut a former rail corridor in his hometown of Blyth beckoned.\n\nThe Dean Nicolle Eucalypt Walk opened in Blyth in August. (ABC North and West: Declan Durrant)\n\nFrom 2010 to 2019, beside the raised dirt of a trail, Mr Roberts planted hundreds of rare trees with the assistance of other locals on community tree planting days.\n\nThe volunteers also carried away the detritus of the long-gone freight industry, which finished in Blyth in the 1980s, including old wire fencing and coal which had fallen from train cars.\n\n'Little things matter'\n\nMr Roberts and non-profit organisation Eucalypt Australia officially opened the tree-laden track named in Dr Nicolle's honour last month.\n\nAbout 100 people attended and followed Mr Roberts along the path, where he stopped at almost every tree to point out its characteristics and speak about the species that were returning to the revegetated space.\n\nMr Roberts said he had noticed a rufus whistler darting by a couple of week earlier.\n\nIan Roberts leads a group of eucalypt enthusiasts through the walk.

I mean, I love playing for this club.\"\n\nDo you have a story idea about women in sport? Email us abcsport5050@your.abc.net.au\n\nGazing at her list of goals, Kerr reckoned her best were the brilliant lobbed finish against Arsenal in the Women's FA Cup final in December 2021 and the remarkable volley-on-the-turn against Manchester United that sealed the WSL title a few months later.\n\n\"The relief I felt scoring my first goal for Chelsea to the relief I felt on the weekend are pretty similar,\" she also noted.\n\n\"Someone interviewed me after the game and asked who writes my scripts, and it was just like, funny, because I feel like I'm just lucky.\"\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nManager Bompastor was thrilled Kerr was \"officially back\" and laughed: \"Sam has been great.

It's been the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\"Sam is one of the players that people pay to come to the stadium for, just to watch her on the pitch. I would probably pay to do that!\n\n\"She's now officially back. She's scored her 100th goal. She has a lot of things to achieve with the club and the team \u2014 but we still need to be patient.\n\n\"It was a long time away from the pitch and everything won't just come like that. Even if the fans don't realise that.\n\n\"What is nice is she's working really hard in the training sessions with us. She has the support of everyone in the club. That's a nice feeling for her.\"\n\nBompastor suggested Kerr might still not be at 100 per cent and was \"probably not ready to start a game\", adding: \"She's someone you have to tell her to go slowly, to stop her a bit, because she's so excited and wants to be on the pitch as much as possible, which we understand. We have to be careful with her still.\"\n\nKerr's next likely outing will be on Sunday in front of the Chelsea faithful at their Kingsmeadow home against Emily van Egmond's Leicester.\n\nAAP",

(AAP: Lukas Coch)\n\nIt's a similar story for Queanbeyan grandfather Tony Wood, who has been on the sidelines for more than four decades.\n\nAlthough he rarely gets recognised while out and about on an average day, when dressed as Victor the Viking at the stadium, he's instantly a familiar face.\n\nThe 60-year-old created Victor the Viking because he knew the newly formed Canberra Raiders needed a mascot who would hype up crowds in good and bad times.\n\nVictor's appearance has evolved over the years \u2014 initially he was made from papier-mache.\n\nIn 1984 Canberra Raiders mascot Victor the Viking's mask was initially made from papier-mache. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\n\"In Canberra's winters where it rained, you'd go to jump up and down and have to hold the head because some of the paper would fall off,\" Mr Wood said.\n\nThese days, the custom-made heads are made to last up to seven years.\n\nHe and Ms Duvall are paid $150 per game to be the mascots, but Mr Wood said he'd do it for free.\n\n\"My saying is that it's all about the smile, it's the smiles that you create,\" he said.\n\nTony Wood says he has no plans to hang up his Victor the Viking costume any time soon. (AAP: Lukas Coch)\n\nWhether the Raiders 2025 season comes to an end this weekend or not, Mr Wood said he had no plans to retire.\n\n\"It's embedded in my soul, so to speak,\" he said.\n\n\"I just don't have any thought of retirement as yet.\"\n\nThe Raiders will play the Cronulla Sharks at 7:50pm on Saturday.",

        "text": "(14) Connor O\u2019Sullivan: Reliable down back, he had seven touches like his near namesake, Mark O\u2019Connor. 5.5/10 (16) Sam De Koning: Played a solid game as Geelong\u2019s second ruckman behind Mark Blicavs. 6/10 (17) Lawson Humphries: Had minimal impact across the game, but also spent a sizable chunk on the bench. 4.5/10 Tyson Stengle gets a quick kick away. Credit: Getty Images (18) Tyson Stengle: Stengle had several key moments, most importantly a soccer goal in the final quarter that halted Hawthorn\u2019s momentum. Stengle, don\u2019t forget, kicked the first goal of the second half \u2013 after 37 seconds \u2013 as the Cats stamped their authority on the match. 7/10\n\n(19) Jack Martin: Had a shocking start with no possessions until well into the second quarter, but then he picked up three touches in about two minutes. He can be that sort of player. He kicked a goal after an assist from guess who \u2026 Dangerfield. 4.5/10 (28) Oliver Dempsey: Not nearly as influential in this final compared to his stellar game against Brisbane two weeks ago, he finished with 14 touches but only one mark. 5.5/10 (30) Tom Atkins: What an important contributor for Geelong, across the season and in their biggest match of the year so far. Atkins got the first clearance from the opening centre bounce and had four touches in six minutes. He finished with 11 tackles, playing his ideal role as a defensive linchpin in the middle. 7.5/10 Tom Atkins and the Cats are into another grand final. Credit: Getty Images (32) Gryan Miers: One of those players who got better as the match wore on. He was in-and-out of the game early but finished with 27 touches and applied a brilliant run-down tackle that summed up Geelong\u2019s desperation and superior attack on the ball. 7/10\n\n(33) Shannon Neale: Not a match-shaper, but he had his moment when he booted a terrific goal about four minutes into the second quarter. He was a good foil for Jeremy Cameron up forward but only had three touches. 5/10 (34) Oisin Mullin: Had a couple of defensive lapses which were costly, one helping Jack Ginnivan to an early goal. Finished with eight touches. 4.5/10 (35) Patrick Dangerfield: A sublime game by the veteran superstar and all-time great \u2013 a truly classic finals performance. Firstly, he booted a goal at the 28-minute mark when Geelong desperately needed it. Then his second quarter (nine touches) was instrumental and he dragged his teammates with him. Danger finished with 31 touches and three goals, but his game was much more than numbers: influence, leadership and stepping up in the biggest moments. 9.5/10 (38) Jack Henry: Went to Jack Gunston from the start, but Henry went off injured at the 15-minute mark. He came back on soon enough, but he may have been hindered and not quite having the capacity to stay with the Hawks forward. Only three touches. 4.5/10\n\n(39) Zach Guthrie: Geelong\u2019s leading possession-winner at half-time (with 16). He had 10 in the second term as the Cats started to find their drive. Others took over thereafter, but Guthrie made a strong contribution. 6.5/10 (42) Mark O\u2019Connor: Spent some time running with Josh Weddle and was effective early. Not one of the star Cats, but he didn\u2019t need to be. 6.5/10 (44) Tom Stewart: Was strong early before he went down with concussion at the 26-minute mark of the first term after being crunched into the turf by Mabior Chol. A horrible situation for him and Geelong. 6/10 (45) Brad Close: In and out of the game and finished with 15 touches. Watch the replay for his excellent mark when manned against Nick Watson early in the last quarter. 5.5/10 (46) Mark Blicavs: An impressive game by the dynamic big man who ran, and ran, and ran and tackled. Blicavs had a good battle with Lloyd Meek but, from this vantage point, had more impact around the ground. Blicavs helped himself to four clearances and, wait for it, 11 tackles. 6.510\n\n(13) Jhye Clark (substitute): Subbed on early after Tom Stewart\u2019s horrible moment in which he was concussed, ending his grand final hopes. Clark came on and off the bench, spending 62 per cent of the game on the field. 4/10 Hawthorn\n\n(2) Mitch Lewis: The key forward\u2019s third goal 12 minutes into the second term had him set for a landmark night and Hawks fans dreaming of a grand final. He was then starved of supply and had little impact on the game. 5.5/10 (3) Jai Newcombe: Like many of his teammates, the hero of the Hawks\u2019 finals campaign started strongly but his influenced waned after quarter-time. Had just 20 touches in the final three quarters in a midfield that was obliterated out of the centre \u2013 and nobody else stepped up to fill the void. 5/10\n\nJarman Impey (right) celebrates a telling goal. Credit: Getty Images (4) Jarman Impey: The rebounding defender had a stinker of a first half. He started nervously and struggled to find the ball, managing just four disposals to half-time, though he finished with 14. He moved forward to kick a goal and set up another when the Hawks challenged in the third term. 3/10 (5) James Worpel: Another on-baller who had his colours lowered. The tough midfielder does his best work in the engine room, but he did not bring his strength to the game with just 16 possessions in what could be his last appearance in the brown and gold. 4/10 (6) James Sicily: The skipper had his greatest effect when the heat was on the ball, forcing the Cats into rushed kicks into their forward line where his safe hands intercepted. He was moved forward late as a Hail Mary but it did not work. 5/10\n\n(10) Karl Amon: The running defender was one of his team\u2019s leading ball-winners with a team-high 28 disposals. The Cats\u2019 smaller forwards were influential, but Amon can hold his head high. His 704 metres gained were a game-high. 6/10 (11) Conor Nash: The big-bodied midfielder did his best work early, but his impact faded as the game wore on. He battled manfully against Smith and Dangerfield but was beaten. He was one of the Hawks\u2019 better on-ballers and fought to the line. 5.5/10 (13) Dylan Moore: The Hawks were at their best when he had the ball. Unfortunately for his team, Moore was another Hawk who was quiet in the second term when the game changed complexion dramatically. His precise kicking under pressure was a feature, as well as his hard running. One of the Hawks\u2019 best. 6.5/10 (14) Jack Scrimshaw: A solid enough performance by the reliable defender, though he did not have his usual influence in the Hawks\u2019 rebounding game. Started on Martin, who did little. 5/10 (15) Blake Hardwick: Started his finals series in a blaze of glory but was another Hawk who had his hands full against the Cats\u2019 red-hot smaller forwards. 4/10\n\n(16) Massimo D\u2019Ambrosio: The wingman did not bring his run and laser-like kicking to the table in a poor performance. His lack of influence was symbolic of a staid running game for his team. 2/10 (17) Lloyd Meek: With Rhys Stanley out, Meek had the chance to stamp his mark on the game but lost on points against the evergreen and reliable Blicavs, who had greater impact around the game. 4/10 Mabior Chol was involved in this incident with Tom Stewart. Credit: Seven (18) Mabior Chol: Battled hard in the ruck and up forward where he competed manfully to bring the ball down. The supply dried after the first quarter. Often criticised for a lack of physicality, Chol showed his intent with a crunching tackle on Stewart that will see him come under the scrutiny of the match review officer. 5.5/10 (19) Jack Gunston: The Hawks\u2019 most dangerous forward, Gunston had a hobbled Henry off the bit with his smarts on the lead. The veteran capped off a fine season with three goals, and had a certain goal denied after a technical free kick was paid against him. Close to the Hawks\u2019 best. 6.5/10\n\nLoading (23) Josh Weddle: Don\u2019t be fooled by the utility\u2019s 13 possessions \u2013 he had a Barry Crocker of a game. Weddle started on the wing, was moved forward but had little impact until the final quarter when the match was all but over. The long lay-off due to injury came back to bite. 2/10 (24) Josh Battle: Fought the good fight against Cameron. The Coleman medallist kicked three goals but Battle, who won some key duels early when the Hawks were on top, could not have done much more given the amount of ball heading into the Hawks\u2019 defence. One of few Hawks to put in a four-quarter performance. 6/10 (25) Josh Ward: The young left-footer had a final to forget. One of their best last week, Ward was on the other end of the spectrum in this game, failing to touch the ball after half-time. Eight possessions from 75 per cent game time is well below par for a midfielder. 1/10 (30) Sam Butler: Subbed out 13 minutes into the third quarter. Others were going worse than the small forward, who was strong in the first two finals, but a change was needed, and he was the player sacrificed for team balance more than performance. 3/10\n\n\n\n(31) Connor Macdonald: This young Hollywood Hawk was reduced to the role of an extra after a hot first quarter. Largely unsighted after quarter-time, Macdonald managed just 13 disposals and a goal in an ordinary performance. 4/10 (33) Jack Ginnivan: The player opposition fans love to hate put in a strong shift in a lost cause. He was among the Hawks\u2019 most consistent players and one of few to stand up when the challenge came in the second quarter. He can be satisfied with how he played. 6.5/10 Nick Watson didn\u2019t have his best night. Credit: Getty Images (34) Nick Watson: Apart from a spectacular crumbing goal in the second quarter, the Wizard waved his wand and nothing happened. He will be stung with just five possessions on the biggest stage of his career. A humbling game should give him plenty of motivation over the summer. 1/10 (37) Tom Barrass: Though the veteran defender held Neale to just the one goal, he was unable to have any impact intercepting, which denied the Hawks the ability to rebound with any oomph. 5/10",

We know that inflation is easing and it's within the RBA's inflation target band,\" Wu said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That means that real wages are growing again.

But not everyone is going to be quite so lucky,\" Wu said.\n\n\n\nFirst home buyer scheme\n\nThe federal government will expand its Home Guarantee Scheme in October , which allows eligible buyers to purchase with a five per cent deposit and no lender's mortgage insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scheme will also remove income and place limits and raise property price caps across most regions.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as more first-home buyers take advantage of the boosted scheme, demand will also rise, pushing about 100 suburbs outside the scheme's caps by the end of the year.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice caps in Sydney will lift from $900,000 to $1.5 million, Melbourne from $800,000 to $950,000 and Brisbane from $700,000 to $1 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide, Perth and Hobart's caps will increase from $600,000 to $900,000, $850,000 and $700,000, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nDarwin's cap will remain unchanged at $600,000, while the ACT will have its cap increased from $750,000 to $1 million.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of the opening of the 80th session last week, I spoke on the theme that will be guiding my Presidency: Better Together. This theme reflects the reality that no single nation, regardless of its size, might, or wealth, can confront the challenges that we face all alone.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's Annalena Baerbock, the former Foreign Minister of Germany who is now the newest President of the United Nations General Assembly, sometimes referred to as UNGA.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld leaders will gather in New York for the Assembly, an event that consists essentially of several days of speeches.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year it's attracting significant attention because multiple leaders have announced their intention to recognise Palestine as a state during the proceedings, like British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With that (two-state) solution now under threat, this is the moment to act. So today as part of this process towards peace, I can confirm the UK will recognise a state of Palestine by the United Nations General Assembly in September unless the Israeli government takes substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza, agree to a ceasefire and commit to a long-term sustainable peace.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is tradition for Brazil to always be the first member state to speak when the General Assembly comes together - because they were the country to step up in the early years of the world body, when other countries were reluctant to do so.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States comes second because it hosts the UN headquarters in New York.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom there the list of nations to give speeches is based on hierarchy and generally a first come, first served basis.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says it's not a time for grandstanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some call it the World Cup of Diplomacy, but this cannot be about scoring points, it must be about solving problems. There is too much at stake. We are gathering in turbulent, even uncharted waters.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year's General Assembly is significant for another reason.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also the 80th anniversary of the founding of the UN - and that history is key to understanding just what the UNGA is and what its powers are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hostilities will end officially at one minute after midnight tonight, Tuesday the 8th of May. We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing. Today is Victory in Europe Day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill announced the end of World War Two in Europe in the middle of 1945, and the war in the Pacific was in its dying stages, with the Japanese destined to sign the instrument of surrender at Tokyo Bay in September of that same year.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut representatives from 50 countries had already been meeting in San Francisco from April 1945 to draft a new agreement they hoped would avoid more bloodshed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were welcomed by the US Secretary of State Edward Stettinius.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The conference of the United Nations on International Organisation is now convened.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter two months of debate, it was the chairman of the conference - British ambassador to the US Lord Halifax - who ultimately brought the proceedings to an end in June.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is now my duty, my honour and my privilege in the Chair to call for a vote on the approval of the charter of the United Nations.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsreel organisations like United News captured the moment of that vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And the heads of the 50 United Nations delegations rise to be counted. The vote is unanimous.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Charter they approved set out four major parts of the new organisation to be called the United Nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere would be a security council to address military problems, an organisation to solve social issues that might ultimately become the cause of future wars, a court to solve disputes, and a general assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd after starting with 51 members, there are now 193 countries who are part of the Assembly - with the Holy See and Palestine having observer status.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Imogen Saunders is the director of the Centre for International and Public Law at the Australian National University in Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah. So the UN General Assembly is the primary representative organ of the United Nations. Unlike the Security Council, every member of the UN has a seat on the General Assembly. It's the forum in which UN members can get together to discuss issues, but also to issue resolutions in terms of matters that are going on in the world, calling on states to do things, commenting on various matters. It also plays really important roles in various elections to the UN: elections of International Court of Justice judges, elections of Security Council members. And recently it's been playing an increasingly important role in directing advisory opinion requests to the International Court of Justice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Saunders says a major feature of the assembly is that its resolutions are recommendations - not binding directives.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat essentially means member states cannot be forced to follow certain courses of action, because the idea is to cooperate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Nonetheless, UN General Assembly resolutions do play an important role because the way international law works is - customary international law, which is binding on all states in the world, is formed of state practice and opinio juris, which is what states do, and a belief that law is binding upon them. And General Assembly resolutions can be used as evidence of both state practice and opinio juris. So although they're not binding in and of themselves, if you have enough General Assembly resolutions that build up over a period of time, they can actually contribute to the development of binding norms of international law.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in 1945, US President Harry Truman believed the United Nations had the potential to avoid a significant amount of bloodshed if it adopted that spirit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we had had this charter a few years ago, then above all, millions now dead would be alive.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorian Stephen Schlesinger told the United Nations network earlier this year that the desire for peace has not always been realised through the General Assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They created a charter which reflected the aspirations of humanity... The spirit was very enthusiastic at that time. Of course we now know today that the UN has survived for 80 years through many different crises, ones that sometimes it helped settle, and others it was not able to able to help settle.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, Dr Saunders says the General Assembly has significant influence through a range of agencies which carry out the UN's mandates - and it also has vast moral authority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Absolutely. Because it is the only body where every UN member has a say. And so when you have a resolution that is either unanimous or near unanimous, then that means that you'll essentially have a plebiscite of all the countries in the world and that carries significant moral weight.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's that authority the new UNGA President hopes will carry some weight as the 80th Assembly proceeds.\n\n\n\n",

The season we are in now is the right season for us to be doing it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFire, water, native plants - all are central to reviving ecosystems that once thrived here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So they are indicators that the soil, the balance and the health of the soil is returning, because they haven't been here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a vision stretching beyond agriculture \u2014 into healing Country itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Healing country heals people and healing the spirit of the land itself, is the most powerful thing that any human can participate in and contribute back to nature itself, or back to boojar as we say.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOral McGuire was born in Western Australia's Wheatbelt in Beverley, on Ballardong land, and says his family\u2019s connection here goes back thousands of years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of our first trees - this area here was planted out in 2008.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince acquiring Yaraguia farm nearly two decades ago, more than a million trees have been planted.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom bush honey to wattle seed, bush tucker is now thriving again.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Mr McGuire insists he and his family are not farmers because he is working with Country, not against it.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor him, restoring land also means restoring identity.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd it is knowledge being recognised nationally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Oral's vision is for the promotion of an entrepreneurial culture within and among the Noongar people of Western Australia. Please welcome Oral McGuire.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this year\u2019s Regenerative Food Systems Conference, Yaraguia farm was held up as a model of Indigenous-led restoration.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil biodiversity expert Dr Jacob Parnell was at the conference and travelled from the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of the global issues that we are facing today, really the foundation of those is the soil. So if we protect the soils and we regenerate, grow those soils then we improve a lot of these other problems we are facing today.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Parnell says Indigenous knowledge is critical to the future of farming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Indigenous people were farming for thousands of years and so going back to saying what were they doing that was right, and understanding that interaction with the soil is very important. And so there is that, and then we also have the science to back that up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNoongar academic and Impact Dream director Heidi Mippy agrees.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s researching new ways of reimagining landscapes, restoration and food systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's many reasons why we have to have Noongar knowledge at front and centre to these conversations. I think one is around land access, so if we don't have our knowledge brought to the system, we are not reconnecting back to country. And part of that is this reconciliation journey that Australia keeps talking about for the past 20 odd years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says regenerative farmers are more open to First Nations perspectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My best relationships here at the moment have been with the regenerative farmers. I think this is because they are more open to thinking about things like soil health, biodiversity, water and all of those key issues that it is a little bit harder to have those conversations with mainstream farmers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBack on Country, Oral McGuire says this work is about creating a future where his children and the next generation can live on and with the land.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The benefit that we have done here as particularly Noongars is, we've put ourselves in a very strong position, where in 10 years\u2019 time we will absolutely exist. And some of our neighbours will be absolutely gone.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHealing Country and, in turn, healing people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The healing of country becomes, you know, your own healing. And so I think I've been on a healing, my own healing journey because of this.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Ballardong Noongar man Oral McGuire this is not just regenerative farming.\n\n\n\n",

She recounts everything from the discomfort of invasive procedures to the financial toll of multiple rounds of IVF, each costing around $10,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fertility treatment is probably the most invasive and emotional medical treatment you can have,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I've had treatment for mental health stuff, and I'd probably be less concerned about that being on the dark web.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE How a fertility clinic hack turned Isaac\u2019s good deed into a privacy disaster\n\n\"You have an internal ultrasound on the third day of your period, which is not something any woman wants to go through, let alone have a report about it on the dark web,\" Lewis says.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked if Genea's apologies for the breach go far enough to make amends, her voice takes on a new tone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm rageful, which I laugh about because that's a protection mechanism,\" she says.\n\n\n\nI'm really angry at these for-profit businesses having no consequences.\n\n\"I want new legislation and IT fines that are proportionate to the company's size and financial capacity and the size and impact of the breach,\" Lewis says.\n\n\n\nHundreds interested in class action\n\nLewis has signed on to a class action investigation being conducted by specialist litigation law firm Phi Finney McDonald.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe feels it's too late to reclaim her privacy, so seeking justice through a class action is \"all she can do\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firm's principal lawyer, Tania Noonan, confirmed the group is looking into \"potential redress\" for those impacted by the breach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Patients at Genea are entitled to the highest levels of privacy and safety to ensure their personal details and medical histories remain secure,\" Noonan says.\n\n\n\nSBS News understands hundreds of people have contacted the firm in relation to the Genea data breach, along with Lewis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think change comes from remittance,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not doing it for the money, although money is fine and all, but if there are damages that are significantly painful, hopefully \u2014 and maybe I'm deluded \u2014 the business will change their practices so that they don't have damages like that again.\"\n\n\n\n'Tumultuous' few years for fertility\n\nAustralia's IVF sector has been subject to intense scrutiny following a series of high-profile incidents and systemic failures that have prompted calls for reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Monash IVF disclosed it had transferred the wrong embryo to a patient, two months after a patient was mistakenly implanted with another client's embryo, prompting its CEO to step down.\n\n\n\n\n\nFamily creation lawyer Sarah Jefford says it's time to look at how the fertility industry is regulated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fertility industry is in a place where there's a lack of community trust and particularly when we have had a tumultuous few years with fertility,\" she says.\n\n\n\nThings need to change so that we can rebuild that trust for the community.\n\nJefford explains that the fertility industry is essentially self-regulated, with \"patchwork\" laws in each state and territory around assisted reproductive treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They don't really have clear legislation on regulating their day-to-day practices of fertility treatment,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's worked really well up until a point, but I think now we need to look at a different framework to really bring it into line with community expectations about what we expect from the fertility industry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe echoes Lewis's sentiment that a financial penalty could lead to a change in how fertility clinics operate.\n\n\n\n\"I know that the fertility industry is worth over $700 million a year. I do think that money talks, so perhaps a financial incentive or penalty could make change in the industry that's otherwise not very well regulated,\" Jefford says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It may not be about getting financial compensation \u2026 but it should set that standard for fertility clinics to know that this is protected information, and they need to be very careful about what they do with it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, the annual revenue from the fertility and IVF industry exceeds $800 million.\n\n\n\nWhat could a class action over the data breach look like?\n\nDavid Vaile, former chair of the Australian Privacy Foundation, says Australia doesn't have a \"vigorous privacy data protection litigation process\".\n\n\n\n\n\nUntil recently, the Privacy Act didn't include provisions for Australians to sue to enforce their rights after a privacy breach. But in February, a landmark reform took effect, allowing individuals to pursue civil action for significant breaches of personal privacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaile says a class action against Genea could be the first and perhaps soon-to-be-famous test of the new privacy tort.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" It may well be that it'll only be through something like a class action that would justify enough legal effort being put into that to actually test [the news laws] out,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf successful, a class action of this kind could compel Genea to pay millions in damages to impacted clients of the data breach, and air allegations in court regarding the company's conduct.\n\n\n\n\n\nClass actions differ from other types of lawsuits, as they involve seven or more persons with claims against the same defendant.\n\n\n\nStream free On Demand Class Actions episode \u2022 Insight \u2022 Current Affairs \u2022 52m episode \u2022 Insight \u2022 Current Affairs \u2022 52m\n\nA class action against Genea could also fall under several types of law, such as consumer, human rights and health law, and its scope would be determined by the law firm working on the case in consultation with the plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious consumer law class actions have addressed losses resulting from scams and unfair business practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman rights class actions have investigated alleged abuses and breaches of human rights, such as an individual's right to privacy.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedical class actions have typically addressed defective operations and treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaile says it will be interesting to see how a legal firm tackles a class action relating to IVF data. He suggests one approach could be to apply equity law to the medical sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Equity isn't about whether you have breached this law or that law, but [asking] 'is your relationship with these people [the patients] so special that you have a special obligation to them?'\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When there's a vulnerable patient who doesn't really have much choice and a very powerful professional \u2014 whether a nurse or doctor in a position of power over them \u2014 that creates what's known as an equitable obligation. So, if there are confidential matters, like medical history, involved, that could be relevant.\"\n\n\n\nData retention\n\nAfter discovering she'd been affected by the data breach, Lewis has been troubled by a niggling question.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy, eight years after the birth of her children, did Genea keep her data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I understand that my medical information and success rate can be useful for the clinic and other women, but why do my name and personal details need to be attached to it? They could have de-identified me,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nSBS News put this question to the fertility group, and a Genea spokesperson said maintaining patient records is mandated by law.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO INTERVIEW: Record numbers of malicious data breaches recorded - how do you protect yourself? SBS News 08:39 English\n\n\"The regulations that govern healthcare operations in Australia and other legal requirements mandate that we maintain patient records for certain time frames,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are also additional record retention requirements that depend on variables such as type of treatment, the outcome of the treatment and the state or territory in which the services were provided.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile data retention policies vary state by state, Vaile says groups that retain data have a responsibility to protect it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it can be nearly impossible to totally prevent malicious actors from hacking data, so the best thing to do is to decrease what can be stolen.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way can be through data minimisation, where companies reduce the amount of data they store.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaile says a common school of thought is that data is a \"toxic asset\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The more you have of it, the higher the risk. The longer you hold it, the longer the data retention period; the higher the risk. The more intensively you use it and enable access to it, the higher the risk,\" he says.\n\n\n\nOnce it's held online, it's just a ticking time bomb.\n\nVaile says if a class action found that health workers have a \"special equitable obligation\" to patients, it could make the entire medical profession \"go nuts\", adding that the way Genea stores clients' data could be a key factor in potential future litigation.\n\n\n\nCalls for an IVF watchdog\n\nAdvocates have been calling for reform in the IVF sector and for the establishment of a national regulator or watchdog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's time that we had an Australian Assisted Reproductive Commission that could actually regulate the entire fertility industry, including donor conception and surrogacy,\" Jefford says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Their job could be setting standards for fertility treatments, fertility clinics and licencing and making sure that there is accountability for fertility treatment in Australia, as well as keeping records for donor treatment and surrogacy to make sure that people have access to information about their conception and birth heritage.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Melanie had to reimagine her family when she discovered there were no Indigenous sperm donors\n\nEvie Kendal, a bioethicist and public health scientist at Swinburne University of Technology, says the checks and balances for the IVF industry aren't up to standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we are in a situation where people are having the incorrect embryo transferred, then something has clearly gone wrong,\" she tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And because the stakes are so high when it comes to making families, we really can't afford to have any errors, or we need to make sure we have as few as humanly possible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only could regulatory reform lead to better health outcomes and data security, but it could also rebuild trust in the IVF sector, Kendal says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are seeing mistakes and human errors that are actually having massive ramifications for families. An independent watchdog or a federal regulatory body would actually bring back a lot of trust with the community,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact that we have inconsistent state legislation when it comes to assisted reproduction and the fact that the rules are different depending on where you are in the country really does undermine that public trust.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO When a good deed becomes a privacy disaster: a sperm donor speaks out SBS News 08:01 English\n\nA federal watchdog could also regulate how much profit an IVF clinic is allowed to make for its services, Kendal says.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, federal Health Minister Mark Butler announced the establishment of an independent accreditation system for fertility providers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccreditation for services will be provided by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care and will be in place by January 2027.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe body would develop nationwide guidelines, performance monitoring metrics, workforce and staffing guidance and clearer complaint pathways.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the government has not committed to legal reform or national laws regulating the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nLewis is hopeful the class action could lead to changes in the \"lucrative\" IVF space and make it a better and more secure process for Australians wanting to start a family.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For some people wanting to have kids, the level of desperation and the money that has gone into it is staggering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There needs to be something in place to protect people, and there have to be some serious consequences for commercial organisations not taking that responsibility seriously.\"\n\n\n\n",

They're about 4000 kilometres south-west of WA (Western Australia). So that gives you some picture of how far this vessel has to travel in the next few weeks.\"\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport and in cricket, Australian team captain Pat Cummins has given an insight into his recovery from a back injury, as he flags his intention to play in all five Ashes tests.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ashes series begins on the 21st of November and the 32-year-old quick says he has plenty of time to prepare.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoach Andrew McDonald has previously said he is confident Cummins will recover to play a major role at the Ashes, while Cummins admitted today it is too soon to make a definitive call.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "(14) Connor O\u2019Sullivan: Reliable down back, he had seven touches like his near namesake, Mark O\u2019Connor. 5.5/10 (16) Sam De Koning: Played a solid game as Geelong\u2019s second ruckman behind Mark Blicavs. 6/10 (17) Lawson Humphries: Had minimal impact across the game, but also spent a sizable chunk on the bench. 4.5/10 Tyson Stengle gets a quick kick away. Credit: Getty Images (18) Tyson Stengle: Stengle had several key moments, most importantly a soccer goal in the final quarter that halted Hawthorn\u2019s momentum. Stengle, don\u2019t forget, kicked the first goal of the second half \u2013 after 37 seconds \u2013 as the Cats stamped their authority on the match. 7/10\n\n(19) Jack Martin: Had a shocking start with no possessions until well into the second quarter, but then he picked up three touches in about two minutes. He can be that sort of player. He kicked a goal after an assist from guess who \u2026 Dangerfield. 4.5/10 (28) Oliver Dempsey: Not nearly as influential in this final compared to his stellar game against Brisbane two weeks ago, he finished with 14 touches but only one mark. 5.5/10 (30) Tom Atkins: What an important contributor for Geelong, across the season and in their biggest match of the year so far. Atkins got the first clearance from the opening centre bounce and had four touches in six minutes. He finished with 11 tackles, playing his ideal role as a defensive linchpin in the middle. 7.5/10 Tom Atkins and the Cats are into another grand final. Credit: Getty Images (32) Gryan Miers: One of those players who got better as the match wore on. He was in-and-out of the game early but finished with 27 touches and applied a brilliant run-down tackle that summed up Geelong\u2019s desperation and superior attack on the ball. 7/10\n\n(33) Shannon Neale: Not a match-shaper, but he had his moment when he booted a terrific goal about four minutes into the second quarter. He was a good foil for Jeremy Cameron up forward but only had three touches. 5/10 (34) Oisin Mullin: Had a couple of defensive lapses which were costly, one helping Jack Ginnivan to an early goal. Finished with eight touches. 4.5/10 (35) Patrick Dangerfield: A sublime game by the veteran superstar and all-time great \u2013 a truly classic finals performance. Firstly, he booted a goal at the 28-minute mark when Geelong desperately needed it. Then his second quarter (nine touches) was instrumental and he dragged his teammates with him. Danger finished with 31 touches and three goals, but his game was much more than numbers: influence, leadership and stepping up in the biggest moments. 9.5/10 (38) Jack Henry: Went to Jack Gunston from the start, but Henry went off injured at the 15-minute mark. He came back on soon enough, but he may have been hindered and not quite having the capacity to stay with the Hawks forward. Only three touches. 4.5/10\n\n(39) Zach Guthrie: Geelong\u2019s leading possession-winner at half-time (with 16). He had 10 in the second term as the Cats started to find their drive. Others took over thereafter, but Guthrie made a strong contribution. 6.5/10 (42) Mark O\u2019Connor: Spent some time running with Josh Weddle and was effective early. Not one of the star Cats, but he didn\u2019t need to be. 6.5/10 (44) Tom Stewart: Was strong early before he went down with concussion at the 26-minute mark of the first term after being crunched into the turf by Mabior Chol. A horrible situation for him and Geelong. 6/10 (45) Brad Close: In and out of the game and finished with 15 touches. Watch the replay for his excellent mark when manned against Nick Watson early in the last quarter. 5.5/10 (46) Mark Blicavs: An impressive game by the dynamic big man who ran, and ran, and ran and tackled. Blicavs had a good battle with Lloyd Meek but, from this vantage point, had more impact around the ground. Blicavs helped himself to four clearances and, wait for it, 11 tackles. 6.510\n\n(13) Jhye Clark (substitute): Subbed on early after Tom Stewart\u2019s horrible moment in which he was concussed, ending his grand final hopes. Clark came on and off the bench, spending 62 per cent of the game on the field. 4/10 Hawthorn\n\n(2) Mitch Lewis: The key forward\u2019s third goal 12 minutes into the second term had him set for a landmark night and Hawks fans dreaming of a grand final. He was then starved of supply and had little impact on the game. 5.5/10 (3) Jai Newcombe: Like many of his teammates, the hero of the Hawks\u2019 finals campaign started strongly but his influenced waned after quarter-time. Had just 20 touches in the final three quarters in a midfield that was obliterated out of the centre \u2013 and nobody else stepped up to fill the void. 5/10\n\nJarman Impey (right) celebrates a telling goal. Credit: Getty Images (4) Jarman Impey: The rebounding defender had a stinker of a first half. He started nervously and struggled to find the ball, managing just four disposals to half-time, though he finished with 14. He moved forward to kick a goal and set up another when the Hawks challenged in the third term. 3/10 (5) James Worpel: Another on-baller who had his colours lowered. The tough midfielder does his best work in the engine room, but he did not bring his strength to the game with just 16 possessions in what could be his last appearance in the brown and gold. 4/10 (6) James Sicily: The skipper had his greatest effect when the heat was on the ball, forcing the Cats into rushed kicks into their forward line where his safe hands intercepted. He was moved forward late as a Hail Mary but it did not work. 5/10\n\n(10) Karl Amon: The running defender was one of his team\u2019s leading ball-winners with a team-high 28 disposals. The Cats\u2019 smaller forwards were influential, but Amon can hold his head high. His 704 metres gained were a game-high. 6/10 (11) Conor Nash: The big-bodied midfielder did his best work early, but his impact faded as the game wore on. He battled manfully against Smith and Dangerfield but was beaten. He was one of the Hawks\u2019 better on-ballers and fought to the line. 5.5/10 (13) Dylan Moore: The Hawks were at their best when he had the ball. Unfortunately for his team, Moore was another Hawk who was quiet in the second term when the game changed complexion dramatically. His precise kicking under pressure was a feature, as well as his hard running. One of the Hawks\u2019 best. 6.5/10 (14) Jack Scrimshaw: A solid enough performance by the reliable defender, though he did not have his usual influence in the Hawks\u2019 rebounding game. Started on Martin, who did little. 5/10 (15) Blake Hardwick: Started his finals series in a blaze of glory but was another Hawk who had his hands full against the Cats\u2019 red-hot smaller forwards. 4/10\n\n(16) Massimo D\u2019Ambrosio: The wingman did not bring his run and laser-like kicking to the table in a poor performance. His lack of influence was symbolic of a staid running game for his team. 2/10 (17) Lloyd Meek: With Rhys Stanley out, Meek had the chance to stamp his mark on the game but lost on points against the evergreen and reliable Blicavs, who had greater impact around the game. 4/10 Mabior Chol was involved in this incident with Tom Stewart. Credit: Seven (18) Mabior Chol: Battled hard in the ruck and up forward where he competed manfully to bring the ball down. The supply dried after the first quarter. Often criticised for a lack of physicality, Chol showed his intent with a crunching tackle on Stewart that will see him come under the scrutiny of the match review officer. 5.5/10 (19) Jack Gunston: The Hawks\u2019 most dangerous forward, Gunston had a hobbled Henry off the bit with his smarts on the lead. The veteran capped off a fine season with three goals, and had a certain goal denied after a technical free kick was paid against him. Close to the Hawks\u2019 best. 6.5/10\n\nLoading (23) Josh Weddle: Don\u2019t be fooled by the utility\u2019s 13 possessions \u2013 he had a Barry Crocker of a game. Weddle started on the wing, was moved forward but had little impact until the final quarter when the match was all but over. The long lay-off due to injury came back to bite. 2/10 (24) Josh Battle: Fought the good fight against Cameron. The Coleman medallist kicked three goals but Battle, who won some key duels early when the Hawks were on top, could not have done much more given the amount of ball heading into the Hawks\u2019 defence. One of few Hawks to put in a four-quarter performance. 6/10 (25) Josh Ward: The young left-footer had a final to forget. One of their best last week, Ward was on the other end of the spectrum in this game, failing to touch the ball after half-time. Eight possessions from 75 per cent game time is well below par for a midfielder. 1/10 (30) Sam Butler: Subbed out 13 minutes into the third quarter. Others were going worse than the small forward, who was strong in the first two finals, but a change was needed, and he was the player sacrificed for team balance more than performance. 3/10\n\n\n\n(31) Connor Macdonald: This young Hollywood Hawk was reduced to the role of an extra after a hot first quarter. Largely unsighted after quarter-time, Macdonald managed just 13 disposals and a goal in an ordinary performance. 4/10 (33) Jack Ginnivan: The player opposition fans love to hate put in a strong shift in a lost cause. He was among the Hawks\u2019 most consistent players and one of few to stand up when the challenge came in the second quarter. He can be satisfied with how he played. 6.5/10 Nick Watson didn\u2019t have his best night. Credit: Getty Images (34) Nick Watson: Apart from a spectacular crumbing goal in the second quarter, the Wizard waved his wand and nothing happened. He will be stung with just five possessions on the biggest stage of his career. A humbling game should give him plenty of motivation over the summer. 1/10 (37) Tom Barrass: Though the veteran defender held Neale to just the one goal, he was unable to have any impact intercepting, which denied the Hawks the ability to rebound with any oomph. 5/10",
