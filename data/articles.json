        "text": "US multinational technology company Nvidia is caught in the middle of an escalating trade war between the world's two largest economies.\n\nNvidia on Tuesday said it will take a US$5.5 billion ($8.64 million) financial hit after Washington placed fresh restrictions on the export of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China, in the latest escalation of a growing battle for AI dominance.\n\nNvidia slumped 6.87 per cent Wednesday after tumbling during premarket trading. The export restrictions on Nvidia come as President Donald Trump's tariffs are roiling global markets and raising concerns about the prospects for global economic growth.\n\nThe NVIDIA logo is displayed on a building in Taipei, Taiwan, on April 16, 2025. (Reuters via CNN)\n\nThe World Trade Organisation on Wednesday said its expectations for global trade this year have \"deteriorated sharply\" owing to the battery of new tariffs on goods and uncertainty around future trade policy.\n\nThe H20 chip, released just last year, was purposefully made to accommodate stringent US export controls to China and allowed Nvidia to continue selling to the country. The model has less computing power than the more powerful H100 AI chip, which has already been banned for sale to China.\n\n\"Nvidia specifically designed the H20 to comply with US exports restrictions\u2026now the rules change and they lost $5 billion,\" said Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Advisors.\n\n\"So this inconsistent trade policy is costing companies a lot of money.\"\n\nThe H20 is believed to have contributed to DeepSeek's successful development of its ChatGPT-like reasoning AI model, R1, which was said to be trained at a fraction of the cost of American equivalents. The development stunned the tech industry and sparked an AI revolution in China.\n\nNvidia said in a Tuesday regulatory filing that it was informed by the US government last week the H20 chips would now require a special licence to be exported to China, which accounted for 13 per cent of sales last year.\n\nThe chipmaker said it will report approximately $8.64 billion worth of charges in its first quarter's earnings on May 28, associated with H20 products for \"inventory, purchase commitments, and related reserves.\"\n\nAnalysts led by Dan Ives, global head of technology research at financial services firm Wedbush Securities, said the financial impact is small relatively, but the restrictions mark a \"strategic blow\" for Nvidia's efforts to continue engaging its Chinese customers.\n\n\"This disclosure is a clear sign that Nvidia now has massive restrictions and hurdles in selling to China as the Trump Administration knows there is one chip and company fueling the AI Revolution and it's Nvidia,\" they said in a Tuesday research note.\n\nNew export rules\n\nThe industry-leading AI chip designer has been caught in the crossfire in recent years as the US seeks to block China's use of American technology to advance its military and AI systems.\n\nThe US Commerce Department confirmed on Tuesday it was issuing new export licensing requirements on China-related exports of Nvidia's H20 and another American AI chipmaker AMD's MI308 chips, as well as their equivalents, according to Reuters.\n\n\"The Commerce Department is committed to acting on the President's directive to safeguard our national and economic security,\" a Commerce Department spokesperson was quoted as saying.\n\nNvidia was told the license requirement would be in place indefinitely, the company said in the filing. It is unclear how the US government would grant the licenses. The company declined to comment beyond its filing.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House (AP)\n\nWhile the Trump administration's imposition of curbs on the H20 chips was widely expected, the restriction was more abrupt than anticipated, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in a Wednesday note.\n\nSince DeepSeek's R1 model shook global markets earlier this year, American lawmakers on both sides of the aisle jointly called for tighter export controls on AI chips.\n\nIn the months since, China has seen an AI boom, with DeepSeek's reveal galvanising investment and pressure on Chinese companies to advance its AI sector. Investor confidence in the country's tech sector has surged, driving rallies in China and Hong Kong stocks.\n\nDeepSeek, along with many of China's established tech giants, have been major consumers of Nvidia's H20 graphic processing units. While Chinese tech heavy-weight Huawei and AI chipmaker Cambroon have developed alternatives to H20s, those China-made chips generally lag in performance, particularly in software maturity, according to Brady Wang, associate director of Counterpoint Research, a market analysis firm.\n\nThe performance gap between Chinese chips and Nvidia's is expected to widen, Wang said, because of \"Nvidia's superior ecosystem and manufacturing advantages,\" even as DeepSeek's rise demonstrates that high-performing AI models can be trained with lower-spec hardware.",

To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025,\" the statements from both companies said.\n\nShein dresses are currently priced between $9 and $143 on its website, while Temu sells them at anywhere between $3.89 and $330 online.\n\n'Shein villages' hit hard by tariffs\n\nThe rapid rise of ultra-fast-fashion retailer Shein has been so key to the fortunes of a group of urban villages on the outskirts of China's southern metropolis of Guangzhou that they have been colloquially dubbed \"Shein villages\".\n\n'Going to China with an empty suitcase': US shoppers swap tips to beat tariffs Photo shows wokers on production line Chinese factories are trying to sell directly to American consumers on social media platforms in a bid to bypass the 145 per cent tariff hike imposed by Donald Trump.\n\nOn a recent visit to Shein villages in Panyu District, however, the mood was glum.\n\nThree factory bosses along with four local downstream suppliers said Shein's local orders were in decline, pointing the finger at moves to diversify production to Vietnam.\n\nFactory owner Mr Li has been in business since 2006, manufacturing apparel for both the Chinese and international markets.\n\nHe has been working with Shein for five years and says orders from the firm this year have dropped by 50 per cent as more orders have moved to Vietnam.\n\n\"The impact is quite obvious,\" he said.\n\n\" Tariffs are not something that we can see an end to for the time being, and we don't know what will happen next. \"\n\nA move to source more from Vietnam could help Shein to continue sending goods to the US at lower tariff rates or without import duties at all for packages sent under de minimis \u2014 though there is no guarantee the threshold will remain in place for goods sent from Vietnam.\n\nBut it also creates a Catch-22 situation for the company \u2014 a potentially costly and time-consuming one in an industry in which price and time are essential.\n\n\"The diversification of its sourcing base and a significant change in its business model will have to go hand-in-hand for Shein,\" said Sheng Lu, professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.\n\nWithout fundamentally changing the business model of pumping out thousands of new styles in small batches and shipping them quickly to end consumers, Shein can't diversify its supply chain, and without diversifying the supply chain away from South China, it can no longer ship products direct to US consumers at low, tariff-free prices, Professor Lu said.\n\nGo to Vietnam or go bankrupt\n\nAlison Layfield, is director of product development at ePost Global, which helps businesses manage cross-border shipping and customs challenges.\n\n\"The model is really genius when you think about it \u2026 but to move that whole business model, that's going to definitely put a hiccup in their turnaround times and their costs,\" she said.\n\n\" Of course they will want to pass those costs onto consumers but \u2026 then consumers are not going to be ordering at the quantity and the price point that they have in the past. \"\n\nFor Shein and Temu, cost and timing are essential. (AP: Richard Drew)\n\nFor Mr Li, the factory owner, the capital investment involved in a move to Vietnam, combined with what he said was less productive labour there compared with China, makes it an unappealing choice.\n\n\"Here we can finish 1,000 pieces of clothing in one day, there it takes a month,\" he said.\n\nWhile he plans to lean more heavily on his factory supplying the domestic market, Mr Li said for some of his compatriots there was little option left.\n\n\"They have only two choices. One is to go bankrupt, and the other is to go to Vietnam.\"\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nReuters",

Banks have an incentive to deposit as little as possible at this rate, and instead prefer to earn the higher cash rate by lending out their balances,\" the RBA notes in this explainer. \"The Reserve Bank is also willing to lend ES balances to banks if this is required. The interest rate on these loans is 0.25 percentage points above the cash rate target. Banks have an incentive to borrow as little as possible at this rate, and instead prefer to borrow at the lower cash rate in the market.\"\n\nIn short, I think we may have to keep getting our heads around a slightly odd cash rate number for a bit longer.",

        "text": "The first winner of what is regarded as one of the most prestigious food awards in the country has claimed it for a second time, almost two decades later.\n\nTathra Oysters has been awarded the 18th annual Royal Agricultural Society of NSW President's Medal at the Sydney Royal Easter Show.\n\nIt's not only a shot in the arm for the business, but also for the oyster industry on the NSW South Coast which has suffered through bushfires, flood, emergencies and even an ex-tropical cyclone.\n\nRecovery from the 2018 bushfire in Tathra was slow, and a decline in tourism after disasters often affects oyster growers. (ABC News: Greg Nelson)\n\nTown hit by fires\n\nTathra Oysters operates on 20 hectares in Nelson Lake in the middle of Mimosa Rocks National Park.\n\nThe town is a jewel in the region's crown, but a disastrous fire in 2018 destroyed 65 homes.\n\nRebuilding was slow, tourism faded and recovery for Tathra Oysters was made harder by another fire in 2020 that polluted the surrounding coastline and forced the closure of the oyster lease.\n\nTathra Oysters are grown in Nelsons Lake in the middle of Mimosa Rocks National Park. (Supplied: RAS)\n\nGary Rodely, the owner and manager of Tathra Oysters, spoke with the ABC prior to the awards about his family's 36-year legacy of oyster farming.\n\nIn 2005, they won the inaugural President's Medal.\n\n\"Back then the $10,000 [prize] was a big part of our income that year,\" he said.\n\nMr Rodely said the business had grown off the back of that early recognition and now produced close to a million oysters a year.\n\nTathra produces Sydney rock oysters on the far south coast of NSW. (Supplied: RAS)\n\nThe solar-powered farm also produces up to 10 million juvenile oysters for other farmers to grow, has a shopfront in Tathra and supplies oysters direct to the Sydney restaurant market.\n\n\"Now we have the ability to employ lots of staff, pay good wages and contribute money into the town,\" Mr Rodely said.\n\nMr Rodely's son Sam, now a marine biologist, has returned to the family business as the time approaches for Mr Rodely and his wife Jo to hand over the family business.\n\n\"We're getting towards the twilight of our career,\" Mr Rodely said.\n\n\"He's taken the business to places we couldn't imagine.\n\n\"We're very proud our son Sam has the same passion for it and for Nelson Lake.\"\n\nTough competition to win\n\nSam, Jo, and Gary Rodely from Tathra Oysters grow Sydney Rock Oysters at Nelsons Lagoon. (Supplied: Dave Rogers)\n\nTo qualify for the Royal Agricultural Society of NSW (RAS) President's Medal, producers must have been champions in the previous year's Sydney Royal Wine, Dairy or Fine Food shows.\n\nTathra Oysters was up against seven other finalists in produce as diverse as olives, pork and gin.\n\nJudge Simon Marnie said the competition was one of a kind.\n\n\"It's the only one in Australia that allows us to judge a pork producer against a dairy or beer producer,\" he said.\n\nThe producers are judged not only on their product, but the overall integrity of their production practices, including environmental, economic and social sustainability.\n\nHard times for oyster growers\n\nWinning this competition is recognition as well for the oyster industry in NSW, which has had an especially difficult few years.\n\nThere are more 2,000 oyster leases in the state, but many have been shut for long periods in recent years due to disease outbreaks, floods, fires, blue algal blooms and other forms of contamination.\n\nOysters are like the canary in the coal mine.\n\nThey are often the first indicator of a problem because they filter the water and are very sensitive to changes.\n\nLeases are closed for safety when water testing shows concerns following flood, fire or contamination.\n\nWidespread flooding in coastal areas of NSW in 2021 shut down many areas and in 2023 floods closed 60 per cent of the oyster growing just before Christmas and the peak selling season.\n\nIn 2022 the Port Stephens oyster industry was shut down due to an outbreak of deadly QX disease, which affects Sydney Rock oysters.\n\nFour oyster businesses never recovered from that outbreak.\n\nIn 2024, a massive grain spill in the Shoalhaven River triggered a blue-green algae outbreak that shut the oyster industry there.\n\nMr Rodely said oyster growers were the stewards of coastal areas.\n\n\"Here we are with farms on the eastern seaboard of Australia where everyone wants to live, so these are environments under pressure,\" he said.\n\n\"You've got oyster farmers are eking out a living in these environments, so if anything goes wrong they've got their finger on the pulse, and that resonates with the values of this award.\"",

(ABC News: Nic MacBean)\n\nThat is 7.1 per cent more than 12 months ago, marking the biggest growth among the country's capital cities.\n\nThe growth in rent for units has been even bigger, with the median rent for a unit in Perth up 8.3 per cent from last year to $650.\n\nREA Group Senior Economist Anne Flaherty said the change was \"astonishing\".\n\nAnne Flaherty says Perth was the most affordable capital city to rent in five years ago but is now the second most expensive, behind Sydney. (Supplied)\n\n\"Five years ago, Perth was actually the most affordable capital city to rent in,\" she said.\n\n\"It's now the second most expensive, behind only Sydney, and what we've seen is that there's been very strong population growth across Perth, but the rate at which we've been building homes is nowhere near keeping up with that.\n\n\" Building capacity is facing some massive constraints, and in the Perth market it's especially the unit sector that's facing really significant cost barriers to more development. \"\n\nMs Flaherty said engineering costs, complex materials and labour shortages in WA, due to the mining sector's higher wages, all contributed to the issue.\n\nHome opens for rental properties around Perth are drawing massive queues. (ABC News: Gian De Poloni)\n\n\"The reality is that for a lot of apartment projects, unless they're being sold at a very, very high price, they're not currently feasible,\" she said\n\nNot enough construction\n\nIn terms of total dwellings \u2014 houses and units combined \u2014 the median rent for Perth is at $680, $70 a week less than Sydney's $750.\n\nOn the other end of the scale sits Melbourne, with median rent for dwellings there now at $575.\n\n\"Melbourne is the second-fastest growing capital city in percentage terms, behind Perth,\" Ms Flaherty said.\n\nMelbourne has done a better job of keeping up to speed with dwelling construction, according to Ms Flaherty. (Unsplash: Pat Whelen)\n\n\"But in Victoria, they've been relatively better at building enough homes to accommodate population growth.\n\n\"They're still falling short, but the shortfall is worse in Western Australia than it is in any other state.\"\n\nThe state's growing population is obviously not confined to Perth, with regional WA the most expensive for rentals across the country, according to REA Group's latest report.\n\nRenting 'in a bad way'\n\nFor Yvonne Larsen, who moved to Australia in 2004 from Norway, the country's relationship with renting has been hard for her to comprehend.\n\nYvonne Larsen says there is a different culture around renting in Norway. (Supplied)\n\n\"How you rent here is absolutely amazing, in a bad way,\" the 50-year-old said.\n\n\"I understand it's different in culture, I find that people who rent here are not really making a rental a home.\n\nThe postcodes where rent takes half your pay cheque Photo shows Gold Coast renters Jazlyn, Melanie and Nahla Misuraca smiling at the camera These are the nation's worst postcodes for renters, as well as the places hit with the biggest rent hikes since the pandemic.\n\n\"In Norway it's completely different \u2014 you take care of the place, you're allowed to make modifications.\"\n\nAnd unlike the Australian home ownership dream, she said in Norway renting for life was common.\n\nThe increasing cost and dwindling supply of rentals in Perth has had a massive impact on her life.\n\n\"I had to let go of my kids nearly two years ago now, and ask them to live with their dad because we couldn't find a rental, me and my partner,\" she said.\n\n\"So we had to move into his old childhood room for 12 months, and we were just lucky that a friend of mine, whose partner has got a rental, said we could rent his house.\"\n\nUnattainable dream\n\nMichael Reeve-Fowkes and his wife have been renting in Wellard, a suburb about 35 kilometres south of Perth, for seven years.\n\nWhile their rent has increased, it has been well below the market average.\n\nThe rent on their house has gone from $295 a week in 2018 to $425 \u2014 a level he believes has been down to the landlord resisting suggested increases from his real estate company.\n\n\"I've seen on a number of occasions they'll (real estate company) send through something about increasing the rent, and then suddenly we'll get an email from the agency saying they've revoked that,\" he said.\n\nWellard is a growing suburb about 35 kilometres south of Perth. (Supplied: Google Maps)\n\n\"So I suspect that the landlord was actually pushing back.\"\n\nMr Reeve-Fowkes, an anaesthetic technician, said he knew he was \"lucky\" when he spoke to friends and colleagues.\n\nBut he said the commute for he and his wife, who both work at hospitals in either Perth or Fremantle, was not ideal.\n\nData shows chasm between rent and income Exclusive new data shows skyrocketing rents have outpaced income growth in every regional area in Australia and all but one capital city.\n\n\"I would absolutely much rather be living much closer (to work), especially if I'm called in the middle of the night for something \u2026 like a patient who's bleeding out,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't want to be stuck in traffic trying to get there in a hurry.\n\n\"But if we were to move closer to work to reduce our commute we'd easily double or more our rent.\"\n\nAnd he said while the pair hoped to attain home ownership one day, legal fees from a divorce had left him with huge amounts of debt.\n\n\"Every time we manage to make a chunk out of that (debt) disappear, we will then look at the housing market again and we've fallen behind,\" he said.\n\n\"For every $10,000 we pay off it feels like the market's gone up 1$100,000 \u2026 we're just not keeping up.\"",

It\u2019s become almost an industry default catchphrase when a microphone is put in front of people.\n\nFor the purposes of simplicity, let\u2019s bundle them all into the same basket, marked footy cliches. Within that basket, one diamond, for me at least, shines a little brighter than the rest.\n\nI have a deep curiosity about the language we use in football. The phrases, the tropes and the pieces of wisdom. All of it. From the quizzical, such as \u201clower your eyes\u201d, to the rhythmic nonsense of \u201cwould-be tackler\u201d and the eternal guiding force of footy\u2019s optimistic spirit, \u201cthere\u2019s always next week\u201d.\n\nIf done right, each player\u2019s determination to do their bit, even if it goes unnoticed from the masses, is all in service for the greater good. Understanding and executing your role gives each player their dignity, a sense of inner peace, because they know that it helps their teammate. The mantra of \u201cplay your role\u201d can quieten down any intrusive inner thoughts, worries or anxieties that will hamper a footballer\u2019s creativity, clarity and ultimately, performance.\n\nAnd it\u2019s performance that footy on the biggest stage is all about. Under the brightest lights the game has to offer, the judgment can be as searingly hot as those burning lightbulbs in the sky. This Friday those lights will be shining down on the Blues and the Kangaroos, just so we can all get a better look at who they are as a collective.\n\nThe pressure is always on if you\u2019re an AFL club; it\u2019s just a matter of what type. The Kangaroos have been a developing side, under the eye of Alistair Clarkson, for some time now, and the moment for some significant results has arrived. North Melbourne, who are you?\n\nThe Blues are the fascination of the league. Like a macabre mutation of everyone\u2019s second team. Everyone has got a friend who is a tormented Blues supporter. The spotlight on them has gone past the comical though; their pressure situation could be described as like living, training and playing at altitude. The air is thin up there, on those rocky peaks of doubt, and it\u2019s hard to breathe. Only wins can bring Michael Voss and his boys down the mountain to breathe with freedom once again.",

Here\u2019s what we know \u2014 and what we don\u2019t know yet.\n\n\n\nWhy are people microdosing weight-loss drugs?\n\nMicrodosing usually refers to psychedelic medication, where people take a low dose of a psychedelic drug to enhance performance, or reduce symptoms of stress and anxiety.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the term is increasingly being used to describe the use of weight-loss injectables at lower-than-recommended doses.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree common reasons come up when I ask patients why they microdose weight-loss drugs.\n\n\n\nCost: Injectables used for weight loss are not covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, so patients must pay for these out-of-pocket. Costs start from $260 per month and increase from there.\n\n\n\nAvailability: Worldwide shortages of these injectable medications have led doctors and patients to seek alternative solutions.\n\n\n\nSide-effects: They are common, and can include nausea, vomiting, bowel habit changes and reflux . Lower doses cause fewer side-effects, which is why the recommended dosing schedule starts low and gradually builds up.\n\nHow do people microdose weight-loss drugs?\n\nA standard dose of semaglutide is 2.4mg, but we start patients on much lower doses (0.25mg) and gradually build up to this by increasing the dose each month. This is because starting at the full dose invariably causes bad side effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nInjectables come in an adjustable auto-injector pen which is twisted until the dose counter shows the prescribed dose in milligrams. There\u2019s a click every time the dial is turned. Once the prescribed dose is showing, it\u2019s injected under the skin.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Experts call for 'urgent' scrutiny after weight loss drugs are linked to suicidal thoughts\n\nTo microdose, patients simply turn the dial fewer times than recommended for the full dose. They estimate a microdose by \"counting clicks\", which means they\u2019re turning it according to the clicks they hear rather than until they see the dial showing the correct dose has been reached.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, they may inject the full recommended dose but do so less often than once per week.\n\n\n\nIs it safe?\n\nUsing injectables in this way has not been researched, so the safety has not been established. However, it\u2019s unlikely lower doses would lead to higher safety concerns.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, logically, lower doses are likely to mean fewer side effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut these drugs do expire after a few weeks, and microdosing could increase the risk of inadvertently using them after their expiration date. Injecting out-of-date medication can be a significant health risk. For example, it could cause infection if bacteria has started to grow.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Can this small patch really help you lose weight and live a healthier life?\n\nThe biggest concern around the safety of microdosing is if patients are doing it without the knowledge of their treating team (such as their GP, dietitian and pharmacist).\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause there are no clear guidelines around microdosing, patients should only try it with caution and under medical care. Their team can assist with issues such as accounting for the limited shelf-life of the medication.\n\n\n\nIs it effective?\n\nAs lower doses than recommended for weight loss have not been tested, we cannot answer this question yet. However, reduced side effects at lower doses make it likely there are also reduced therapeutic effects.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my experience there\u2019s a reason patients increase their doses as recommended: they simply don\u2019t lose enough weight on the starting doses.\n\n\n\nAt the height of semaglutide shortages in 2023, experts from the American Diabetes Association published recommendations around how to prescribe lower doses for patients with diabetes. But these recommendations were for diabetes management, not for patients using the drug for weight loss.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that for patients using Wegovy to reduce heart attack and stroke risk \u2014 which Australia\u2019s Therapeutic Goods Administration recently approved it for \u2014 there\u2019s no evidence that cardiovascular benefits will be achieved at lower-than-recommended doses.\n\n\n\nIs there any role for microdosing weight-loss drugs?\n\nThere may be a role for microdosing in a few scenarios:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen side-effects are not manageable: when side-effects are intolerable for patients, even on the lowest introductory dose, there may be a role for individualised approaches. But this is best done with clear communication and regular monitoring, so patients are not under-treated.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE I used Ozempic to help me realise my dream of becoming a mum. It took a toll even after I quit\n\nSupply disruption: if there\u2019s a supply disruption, lowering the dose or lengthening the time between doses may be preferable to ceasing the medication altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\nMaintenance of weight loss: once therapeutic levels have helped patients achieve their goal weight, lowering the dose may be a helpful longer-term way of keeping them there. We know stopping these drugs altogether results in rebound weight gain. We await evidence for microdosing for weight maintenance.\n\n\n\nSo what\u2019s the take-home message?\n\nPatients who use injectables as part of their approach to weight loss should be under the care of an experienced team, including a GP, who can monitor their progress and ensure they achieve their weight loss in a safe and sustainable way.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrodosing weight-loss drugs currently has no clear evidence base, but if a person wants to attempt it, they should do so with the full knowledge of their treating team.\n\n\n\n\n\nNatasha Yates is a practising clinician and a PhD candidate at Bond University.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leaders of both major parties have locked horns in a second leaders debate hosted by the A-B-C.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton framed his pitch to voters around a familiar question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Are you better off today than you were three years ago?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHis answer:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As I've moved around the country and spoken to literally thousands of Australians - young families, pensioners, people in small businesses - it's been obvious to me that people don't feel better off.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says that's not true - and he has an optimistic vision for Australia's future.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says Labor will cut taxes, boost manufacturing, strengthen healthcare, slash student debt by 20 per cent and lower the deposit required from first home buyers to five per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're turning the corner. We have inflation that's down. We have real wages that are up. We have unemployment that's very low at just four point one percent, and interest rates have started to fall. They started to rise before the last election. But we know that there's much more work to do. And that's why we have a plan.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHousing was the first major issue canvassed in the debate, and it got the most time, off the back of a string of centrepiece policies unveiled in recent days.\n\n\n\n\n\nHost David Speers asked about economist analysis that suggests both parties' policies could raise house prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese says the government's plan would not make things worse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have a comprehensive $43 billion Homes for Australia plan, making sure, whether it's about increased social housing, increased private rentals or increased home ownership, as well for our Help to Buy scheme, that will all assist. The key of course, is supply, and that's why only Labor is offering a plan at this election, to increase supply of housing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton has blamed high house prices on recent spikes in immigration.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the Coalition is proposing a $5 b illion fund to identify land releases that are being stalled by a lack of infrastructure like sewage or roads, and also to reduce migration by 25 per cent for two years, while preventing foreigners from buying houses during that time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother key plank of Coalition policy to support first home owners is that -\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For the first six hundred fifty thousand dollar of your mortgage that will be interest that you could claim against your income. So for an average couple that will be about 11 or $12,000, a year over five.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth leaders shut down the prospect of reform to negative gearing, seen by many as the elephant in the room of Australia's housing debate.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the other elephant looming large has been Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton was asked if he trusts him:\n\n\n\n\n\nDUTTON: \"Well, we trust the United States and I don't know the President, I've not met him, the Prime Minister, obviously, has been able to.\u201d\n\n\n\nSPEERS: \u201cSo you're not willing to say you trust Donald Trump?\u201d\n\n\n\nDUTTON: \u201cI don't know Donald Trump, is my point. My point is that who I trust is the Australian people and my job is to stand up for our country's interests.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese has been equally diplomatic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have no reason not to. I've had a couple of discussions with him. In the last discussion, we agreed on a series of words that he would give consideration, great consideration was the words that he used, and he did that. In the end, he made a decision as part of the US administration to put these tariffs on every country. We got the lowest amount but we made it very clear that that was an act of self harm by the United States.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the topic of international relations, Mr Dutton was forced into an awkward admission of fault during the debate after previously refusing to back down on his erroneous claim that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto publicly announced a request by Russia to host military aircraft on Indonesian territory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton says he was in error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was a mistake.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the Opposition Leader maintained that the Prime Minister was caught unawares.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we've seen in the last 12 hours or so is that the Russian envoy to Indonesia has confirmed that there have been discussions, and obviously there is a concerning closeness in that relationship. And I think the main point here is that the Prime Minister knew nothing of it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Prime Minister jumped on his opponent's admission.\n\n\n\n\n\nALBANESE: \"Peter say why didn't we know something that didn't exist, and what didn't exist, and Indonesia has confirmed, (is) the idea of a base being used by the Russian Air Force in West Papua.\"\n\n\n\nSPEERS: \"Do you accept that Mr Dutton?\"\n\n\n\nDUTTON: \"No, I don't, I don't accept that. I think the Prime Minister's full of bluster here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese says Australia has a strong relationship with Indonesia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea that you just throw out these comments, is just extraordinary. And the fact that we just saw a double down on it as if there's nothing to see here just shows that there's no understanding of the need for diplomacy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAsked to name a major economic reform he'd most like to be remembered for, Mr Dutton pointed to structural changes in energy markets, starting with a gas reservation and later strengthened by nuclear plants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Energy is the economy, David. Everything we use, everything around us is either running or has been created because of the use of energy, farming, fertilizer, cold storage. Everything that we rely on in our society, in a modern society like ours relies on energy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese pointed to affordable childcare as his big-vision reform, saying Labor secured a three-day guarantee for parents in its first term.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australia's worsening housing affordability has reached a new milestone, with another capital city entering the $1 million club for median houses prices \u2014 Adelaide.\n\n\n\n\n\nDomain's report for the March quarter, released on Thursday, found Adelaide's median house price grew $11,119 (or 1.1 per cent) to $1,000,202 \u2014 surpassing the $1 million mark for the first time, according to the property listings website.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is the fifth capital city to crack a seven-figure median, according to Domain, joining others including Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide's record wasn't the only one that was marked in Domain's latest report. It found median house prices also reached new highs in Sydney ($1.692 million), and Perth ($917,706) which Domain believes will reach $1 million by the end of the year. The median at a combined capital level also reached a record high ($1.179 million).\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But even though we've seen a quarterly growth for house prices, we've got a slowdown in the pace of price gains and on that annual basis,\" said Nicola Powell, the chief of research and economics at Domain. \"It's the slowest increase that we've seen in two years.\"\n\n\n\nHow are house prices tracking across the country?\n\nOver the past decade, house prices have surged across most of Australia, though some cities have experienced steeper increases than others.\n\n\n\n\n\nHobart recorded the strongest growth, with median house prices rising 111 per cent since 2015. The median now sits at $710,077, up from $335,814.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide followed closely with a 110 per cent increase (or $524,922), taking the median price to $1,000,202 from $475,280.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrisbane also witnessed a steep rise, up 108 per cent to a median of $1,022,026, compared to $491,431 ten years ago.\n\n\n\nCredit: SBS News In Sydney \u2014 already the country's most expensive market \u2014 the median house price jumped 82 per cent, from $930,009 in 2015 to $1,691,731.\n\n\n\n\n\nMelbourne's median rose 60 per cent to $1,035,887, up from $648,527.\n\n\n\n\n\nCanberra experienced a 72 per cent increase, bringing its median to $1,049,067, from $608,585.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerth recorded a 51 per cent rise, with the median climbing from $608,312 to $917,706.\n\n\n\n\n\nDarwin was the exception, with prices virtually flat over the decade. The median house price rose just 1 per cent, from $652,173 in 2015 to $659,172.\n\n\n\nWhat's driving the growth in Adelaide?\n\n\"It's been continuous for Adelaide in terms of that price growth,\" Powell said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obviously, the low cash rate during the pandemic initiated this upswing in price, and it's almost been unstoppable since then \u2014 up 84 per cent over the past five years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe pointed to a range of demand drivers: \"Strong population change, demographic patterns in terms of demand for housing have certainly supported price growth. I think strong rates of overseas migration as well as positive interstate migration means that Adelaide has benefited from strong population flows.\"\n\n\n\nCredit: SBS News Credit: SBS News Powell said a growing population and weaker supply have contributed to price growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you layer with some of the other things like remote working, the lifestyle that Adelaide has to offer \u2014 what we've seen in the past five years is that 110,000 people have been added to the population. That is like adding the LGA (local government area) of Tea Tree Gully \u2026 to the population in a five-year period,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ultimately, supply just hasn't been able to keep pace.\"\n\n\n\nHousing heats up as an election battleground\n\nHousing affordability is already emerging as a key issue in this federal election, and Powell said 2025 could prove pivotal \u2014 especially for first home buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"2025 is the year to watch,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Housing is a key battleground clearly for the election. And so housing policies for first home buyers might be that difference on whether somebody can purchase their home this year or not.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth major parties are offering demand-side support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The 5 per cent [first home buyer] deposit scheme being expanded by Labor and then the tax deductibility for new homes from the Coalition \u2014 what this will do is help to bring forward demand and that in itself could support pricing at the lower end of the housing market,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Powell warned a \"demand-side policy needs to be complimented by a supercharged supply- side policy\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to reduce the cost of building a new home,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Taxation contributes anywhere between 20 and 40 per cent of the new home. We need to do something about that taxation cost because, ultimately, that will bring down the cost of buying a new home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPowell also noted the Coalition's approach appeared to be more \"targeted\" towards new homes, which could in turn incentivise new construction because of those tax benefits.\n\n\n\nWhat's next?\n\nPrices are still expected to rise in Adelaide and other capitals, but the pace of growth is likely to be restrained by worsening affordability, Powell said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile February's interest rate cut has slightly improved borrowing capacity, Powell doesn't consider it a \"game changer\" for buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There has been a widening gap between where home prices sit and the capacity of buyers to pay for a home. Obviously, with the reduction in the cash rate in February, that has improved borrowing capacity. But I don't think that's a game changer for buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need multiple rate cuts to really help alleviate the burden, the financial burden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Until home loan serviceability improves significantly, it\u2019s difficult to envisage our housing markets transitioning into another pronounced growth trend.\"\n\n\n\n",

By 2016, that had dropped to around 35 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, what are the major parties offering first home buyers heading into the election?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe'll start off with the current government - Labor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI want young people and first home buyers to achieve their dream of home ownership.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nCentral to Anthony Albanese's plan is enabling all first home buyers to purchase a place with a 5 per cent deposit.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, you need a 20 per cent deposit to buy a house.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't have the full amount, you have to pay Lenders' Mortgage Insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\nLMI is valued at 1 to 5 per cent of the loan, and exists to protect banks against risky loans. They take out insurance, you pay for the premium.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Labor's plan, the government will guarantee the difference for first home buyers - basically telling the bank they're good for the rest of the deposit amount if the home owner defaults on the loan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt will be available for homes valued all the way up to the average price in every city and region. And you won't have to pay a single dollar in mortgage insurance.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn't a new policy - the First Home Guarantee has existed in some form since the Morrison Coalition Government.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreviously, there were restrictions on who could access it, and a limited number of placements per year, starting at 10,000 places in 2020, up to 50,000 in the last financial year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's different about Labor's policy is it's open to ALL first home buyers, without a cap on income, or a limit on places per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat that looks like for the median priced Australian house,at $820,000 is:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can buy it with a deposit of $41,000, compared to $160,000; and you save around $35,000 in LMI costs, although the exact amount varies state by state.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut to actually service the loan with a a 5 per cent, you probably need to earn about $150,000 as a single, or $180,000 as a couple with no kids, well above the average Australian household income of $120,000 a year (according to the Grattan Institute).\n\n\n\n\n\nNone of that takes into account the other costs associated with buying a home, like stamp duty which could cost anywhere between $5,000 and $50,000 for an $820,000 home depending on where you live.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Michelle Cull from Western Sydney University says it may help some people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c Lower income earners would not be able to borrow that amount anyway. So it's still not a solution for them. But for those once again on slightly higher incomes and to have security with their their work and maybe younger people who are expecting their incomes to increase, it could work very well. But if we did have interest rates increase rapidly, as we've seen in the past, then that's going to put a lot of pressure on those people with big mortgages.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor is also looking at targeted increases to supply - building 100,000 new homes in eight years, reserved for first home buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNo competition from property investors, just a fair crack for young Australians.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan is to work with the states to speed up the house building process - fast tracking land release and planning decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt includes $2 billion in grants on offer to states and territories, that will have to be matched, and $8 billion in zero interest loans.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor says construction on the first homes will begin in 2026, and the first will be ready to move in to by 2028.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coalition has a two part pitch.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first idea is recycled from the last election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe will allow Australians to access up to $50,000 of their super towards a deposit for their first home. That allows home ownership earlier. Your super, ultimately, is your money. It's not the government\u2019s money.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe money would need to be returned to super once the house was sold.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are concerns that removing money from superannuation would impact the amount someone retires with, and that many young people don't have $50,000 in superannuation anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second is an idea that's very new to Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nShadow Housing Spokesperson Michael Sukkar says the coalition will allow first home buyers to claim interest paid on tax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFor so many young Australians, the ability for them to buy a home is constrained by the fact that with relatively high interest rates, they're just unable to make money. We're not giving them a grant, we're not giving them a free kick. We're gonna give them back a bit more of their own money for those first five years, which is the most critical time for a first time buyer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's ONLY for new homes, and ONLY for first home buyers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's no cap on the total amount of the loan or price of the house, but it's only applied to $650,000 of a loan, and for the first five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there's an income cap for who can access it - $175,000 for individuals, and $250,000 for couples.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiam Davies from the Centre for Urban Research says it won't help with the upfront cost of a home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Liberal party's policy is effectively to make it cheaper to take on larger loans. Now this is based on the idea that the household already has a deposit. Households that don't have a deposit won't benefit from this scheme, but households that have a deposit will be able to leverage that deposit slightly further or increase the amount of loan they take because of the tax concessions they'll get.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHelping people buy their first home is one part of the plans.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other is supply.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has set a target of 1.2 million new homes to be built in 5 years, from July 1 last year, until mid 2029.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat means building 60,000 homes every three months, or 240,000 each year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's ambitious - Australia has never done it before - the best quarter on record saw 56,000 dwellings completed.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween July and September last year, there were just 45,000 homes built.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor's new supply policy - the 100,000 new homes set aside for first home buyers - is part of this 1.2 million home goal.\n\n\n\n\n\nMatt Bowes from the Grattan Institute says it could help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIf that 100,000 new homes target that they've announced for the scheme is met, that would have an important impact on adding to new housing supply at a time when housing construction and housing starts are quite low, when housing construction costs are very high and interest rates are high.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother first term supply policy from Labor is the Housing Australia Future Fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was set up in 2023, with $10 billion put into an investment account, called a future fund.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe profits made from that investment go towards housing - specifically, $500 million is taken out once a year.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal was to build 30,000 social and affordable homes in five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo homes have been completed.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese says some are in the pipeline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c 28,000 under construction or in planning, so awaiting approval\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has vowed to axe the HAFF if it wins the election.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberal Party has promised $5 billion towards essential infrastructure to build new homes - to establish water, power, and sewerage connections to new development sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Sukkar says there are already places identified where it will help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe've worked directly with hundreds of councils, literally hundreds. We've identified the precise projects by lock 500,000 new homes, and we know those sorts of projects will be overwhelmingly projects that will be attractive to young first home buyers.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWith no policies to actually build houses, Peter Dutton says his focus is on reducing demand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe're cutting the migration program by 25 per cent because Labor has had it at a record high. And that's increased the demand on housing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan is to reduce permanent migration from 185,000 to 140,000 for two years, and will further reduce international students to 240,000 a year compared to Labor's current 270,000 level.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Labor and the Coalition will ban foreign investors buying established homes for 2 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final piece of the housing puzzle is having people to build them.\n\n\n\n\n\nChief Executive of Master Builders Australia Denita Wawn says there aren't enough tradies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe need more people. We need skilled people to do the job. One of the reason that costs are so high is simply we are taking too long to build because we don't have enough skilled people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coalition will subsidise businesses employing apprentices in areas there's a skills shortage - giving them $12,000 a year for the first two years for new apprentices.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor's will continue offering free TAFE , and set up an incentive payment worth $10,000 across the course of an apprenticeship, for apprentices in residential construction.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut - will all this drive up house prices?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Peter Dutton was asked exactly that, he said:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOur prices will drive up home ownership. Our policies will drive up home ownership. That's what we're on about here.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst Finance Minister Katy Gallagher told the ABC modelling has been done.\n\n\n\n\n\nGALLAGHER: \"Well, it was advice from Treasury and the advice was that this expansion of this program would not have a significant impact on house prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nREPORTER: \"Is there a number?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGALLAGHER: \"No, there isn't a number.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Economist Saul Eslake says both policies will drive up house prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c Well, both major parties policies will have the effect of putting upward pressure on house prices by allowing people to borrow more money which they'll spend on housing than they would otherwise. And that's consistent with what's now more than 60 years of evidence that unambiguously shows that anything that allows Australians to spend more on housing, whether it's first time owner grants, stamp duty, concessions, easier lending criteria, lower interest rates, mortgage guarantee schemes, Shared Equity schemes, lower interest rates, all the proposals that are being put at this election, they result in higher house prices and fewer Australians owning housing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the coalitions tax break policy will increase what people can spend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEspecially when combined with their other super for housing policy, will allow those eligible to borrow more and spend more on housing than they otherwise would. That will drive up prices, and even though the coalition says that skewing demand from first home buyers to new houses will prompt builders to build more new houses. The reality is that that will take time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Labor's policy will have a similar effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cLabor\u2019s at least being honest in admitting that they're just arguing that it won't be a significant increase in house prices.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd lastly - the Greens.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst they're not going to be in a position to form government, they may be part of a minority government.\n\n\n\n",

I actually put a lot of Vegemite on my toast when I eat bread,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a good thing. I did hear the report. It's rather odd they're allowing Marmite, which frankly, is rubbish. Let's be clear: I'm pro-Vegemite, anti-Marmite. That's my position.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVegemite's British rival, Marmite, was granted approval by the CFIA in 2020 despite the fact that an earlier shipment was blocked due to concerns about added vitamins.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The fruit that is a source of folate and right on our doorstep\n\nIn a video posted to Instagram, Walters shared his disappointment over the CFIA's decision to remove approximately CA$8,000 ($9,031) worth of stock and ban the spread from the cafe's menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Despite Amazon and major grocery stores continuing to profit of the sale of Vegemite and similar products like Marmite, for some reason, our genuinely Australian/Canadian coffee shops offering a healthy slice of home away from home is seemingly worth targeting,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking from a hospital bed while receiving treatment for spina bifida, a condition linked to folate deficiency during early weeks of pregnancy, he said Vegemite had a personal significance to him, as the spread is fortified with folic acid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Spina bifida exists because there's a lack of folate in the diet at conception. One of the major things that Vegemite adds to everyone's daily intake is folate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want to fight for my business; I'm going to stand up for what I believe in.\"\n\n\n\n",

It\u2019s become almost an industry default catchphrase when a microphone is put in front of people.\n\nFor the purposes of simplicity, let\u2019s bundle them all into the same basket, marked footy cliches. Within that basket, one diamond, for me at least, shines a little brighter than the rest.\n\nI have a deep curiosity about the language we use in football. The phrases, the tropes and the pieces of wisdom. All of it. From the quizzical, such as \u201clower your eyes\u201d, to the rhythmic nonsense of \u201cwould-be tackler\u201d and the eternal guiding force of footy\u2019s optimistic spirit, \u201cthere\u2019s always next week\u201d.\n\nIf done right, each player\u2019s determination to do their bit, even if it goes unnoticed from the masses, is all in service for the greater good. Understanding and executing your role gives each player their dignity, a sense of inner peace, because they know that it helps their teammate. The mantra of \u201cplay your role\u201d can quieten down any intrusive inner thoughts, worries or anxieties that will hamper a footballer\u2019s creativity, clarity and ultimately, performance.\n\nAnd it\u2019s performance that footy on the biggest stage is all about. Under the brightest lights the game has to offer, the judgment can be as searingly hot as those burning lightbulbs in the sky. This Friday those lights will be shining down on the Blues and the Kangaroos, just so we can all get a better look at who they are as a collective.\n\nThe pressure is always on if you\u2019re an AFL club; it\u2019s just a matter of what type. The Kangaroos have been a developing side, under the eye of Alistair Clarkson, for some time now, and the moment for some significant results has arrived. North Melbourne, who are you?\n\nThe Blues are the fascination of the league. Like a macabre mutation of everyone\u2019s second team. Everyone has got a friend who is a tormented Blues supporter. The spotlight on them has gone past the comical though; their pressure situation could be described as like living, training and playing at altitude. The air is thin up there, on those rocky peaks of doubt, and it\u2019s hard to breathe. Only wins can bring Michael Voss and his boys down the mountain to breathe with freedom once again.",

        "text": "A local woman discovered the \"mess\" during her morning walk, and was immediately struck by the foul smell coming from the mud.\n\nA proud Aussie community has been left embarrassed at the \u201cabsolute mess\u201d created near one of the nation's most popular beaches. Pictures shared to social media show the grassy area up from the Gold Coast\u2019s famous Burleigh Heads has been turned into a field of mud following a two-day surf event.\n\nLocal woman Cindy Amey walks up the hill at 6:00am every morning, and she was left \u201cshocked\u201d by what she saw this week. With so many tourists in town for the Easter holidays, she\u2019s worried what they\u2019ll think of her suburb.\n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing, it\u2019s horrific. The grass up there had been looking so good, they\u2019d even relaid turf up there recently,\u201d she told Yahoo News.\n\n\u201cFamilies go up there, and the view is fantastic. It\u2019s a good place to go and have a picnic, but you couldn\u2019t do that now, it\u2019s embarrassing. If I arrived here on holidays and that was on my doorstep, I'd be wondering what's going on?\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAnother woman Lisa Evans said on Facebook that she feared no one would be able to use the park for months. \"Locals [are] throughly irritated and disappointed by the use & abuse of the park time and time again,\" she wrote.\n\nDeep tyre tracks and puddles of water can be seen across the hilltop, and many have complained the area had begun to smell like a bog. \u201cIt\u2019s got that creek-like sewer smell,\u201d one resident told Yahoo.\n\nBurleigh Heads is ordinarily a popular place for tourists and locals to relax. Source: Getty/Cindy Ames\n\nWhile many locals were outraged, others were confident the grass would soon grow back. Source: Cindy Amey\n\nDozens of Gold Coast locals have shared their frustration at the \u201ctrashing\u201d of the hill on social media. \u201cThis is a disgrace. There have been hundreds of events on Burleigh Hill over the years\u2026 Never has the hill been left in such a state as this,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cA once beautiful area enjoyed by families, especially over Easter, is now just a mud bath,\u201d another added. \u201cJust horrible,\u201d someone else lamented.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut others weren\u2019t phased by the state of the park, with some confident a sprinkling of seeds and a few weeks of sunshine would see the grass restored. \u201cIt will be as good as ever in a few weeks. I think people and tourists expect this in a heavy downfall of rain,\u201d one person said.\n\nLocals fear it will be weeks before the park is restored. Source: Lisa Evans\n\nPark likely to be fully restored after Easter\n\nYahoo News has made several attempts to speak with Surfing Australia, which hosted the Boardriders Battle at Burleigh Heads on April 12 and 13. But it did not respond before publication.\n\nGold Coast City Council told Yahoo News its officers will inspect the site for any damage once the organisers have finished packing up at the end of the week. There\u2019s another surf event planned next week, so full repairs aren\u2019t expected until that has concluded after Easter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEvent organisers are responsible for all costs associated with rectifying any damage as a result of the event, including grass restoration,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\n\u201cMinor repairs will be conducted where possible prior to the World Surf League event beginning set up early next week. Full repairs will be conducted following the conclusion of the surf events.\u201d\n\nOrdinarily, the entire hill would be flooded with surfers and families.
