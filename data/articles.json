(Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nSome said they were asked to hand over their phone so officers could download its contents.\n\nOne Norwegian man said he was denied entry because he had an unflattering meme of US Vice President JD Vance on his phone.\n\nAn Australian writer, Alistair Kitchen, reported last month he was sent home after being interrogated about his blogging on political protests.\n\nHe later claimed officials found \"evidence of drug use\" on his phone and he felt coerced into admitting he had tried drugs in the past.\n\nThe threat of being detained and sent back home now lingers for Australians hoping to holiday in the US.\n\nBut are immigration officers really ramping up their efforts to stop Australians and other nationalities from entering the US under the Trump administration?\n\nMelbourne-based immigration lawyer Sherwin Noorian told 9news.com.au US officials were simply flexing a legal muscle that had always existed.\n\nMelbourne-based immigration lawyer Sherwin Noorian, principal lawyer of Globalised Pty Ltd. (Supplied)\n\nBut Noorian said travellers should not feel coerced into admitting prior drug use or their political beliefs to an immigration officer.\n\n\"The US has very strict controlled substances laws for non-citizens who are travelling to the US, so even admitting to using marijuana once in one's home country\u2026 they can use that against the traveller and deny them entry,\" Noorian explained.\n\n\"There's a bit of nuance to it and it may not legally stand up, but they can kind of do whatever they want at that point.\"\n\nNoorian's advice is to never \"incriminate yourself\" if you've never been convicted of anything.\n\nHe's also noticed an \"anecdotal\" rise in reported cases of travellers being detained and their phones confiscated.\n\nDo you have a story? Contact reporter April Glover at april.glover@nine.com.au\n\nIt's always been done, but he posits the theory that immigration officers could now be using an \"advanced computing system to scan the devices for anything they deem suspicious or of concern\".\ufeff\n\nHe also said travellers do have a right to refuse a request to give up their phone, but warns this could result in automatic entry refusal.\n\n\"It's a condition of entry, so to speak, that you would hand over that device when asked,\" he added.\n\nNoorian said travellers shouldn't feel coerced into admitting prior drug use or their political beliefs to an immigration officer. (Anadolu via Getty Images)\n\nNoorian said he was aware of reports that travellers were being turned away at the border over phone content that was critical of the Trump administration, including memes or political posts.\n\nHe suspected that travellers who were granted an Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) visa waiver could be flagged and interrogated at the border for a variety of reasons and sometimes it was not hard to find one that sticks.\n\n\"That could be used, especially if they're high-profile, as a reason to take someone aside to question them and give them a hard time,\" he said.\n\n\"If they're those types of officers who, and not all of them are like this, but some would be looking for people who are against the administration or against what they deem to be the US interest, they would use that as a reason to question someone and begin that interview.\"\n\nA meme alone wouldn't be enough to deny entry, Noorian said.\ufeff\n\n\"But through the course of that [interview], they would begin looking for what they can use to build a case to deny entry,\" he added.\n\nREAD MORE: Retirement crisis coming for millions of Australians\n\nNoorian said the ESTA, which most Australians use to enter the US, does not guarantee entry.\n\nThe first time a traveller is genuinely assessed under an ESTA, he said, is once you land on US soil.\n\n\"For most people, they wait until they're in the country and then they say, 'OK, we're going to assess you for your eligibility to enter,'\" he said.\n\n\"I think the Smartraveller advice on this is really quite accurate when they say, be aware that the US authorities have a high level of discretion for visa waiver entries.\n\n\"It means even more for an Australian traveller than someone coming from Canada or the UK.\"\n\nMost Australian travellers enter the US under the ESTA visa waiver. (PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nThe current Smartraveller advice for Australians travelling to the US warns that \"entry requirements are strict\".\n\n\"US authorities have broad powers to decide if you're eligible to enter and may determine that you are inadmissible for any reason under US law,\" the advice reads.\n\nAll hope is not lost for a US holiday if you're denied entry under an ESTA, though.\n\nNoorian said he had cases of clients being refused entry but then able to enter the US through a visitor visa obtained via the US consulate.\n\n\"It's not a lifetime ban, they can reapply, but in this environment, it depends on the circumstances,\" he added.\n\n\"If they admitted to drug use, that could be a big problem.\n\n\"But it can be overcome.

(ABC Broken Hill: Oliver Brown)\n\nCouncil general manager Jay Nankivell said the gallery had received $100,000 per year in the past through the program and that it was concerning to miss out on the latest round.\n\nGallery advisory committee member and artist Kelly Leonard moved to Broken Hill four years ago to be a part of the Far West's rich art scene.\n\n\"The art gallery really is a centrepiece, a location where we can connect, develop opportunities for each other,\" she said.\n\nBroken Hill has a rich artistic history. (Supplied: Priscilla McIntosh)\n\nMs Leonard said she would need to travel interstate or to Sydney for workshops and professional development if it were not for the gallery.\n\n\"We're only just recovering from the COVID years out here, and to go through something like this, it's extremely frustrating,\" she said.\n\nArtist Wendy Martin said any funding cut would be a major setback.\n\n\"Art plays a major part in the tourism industry and attracts a huge amount of people to our city,\" she said.\n\n\"Lots of artists have been given a career start by having their work displayed in the gallery, including myself, and I have been painting and exhibiting in Broken Hill now for the last 50 years.\"\n\nTracey Callinan says art galleries and communities will suffer if the funding is not restored. (Supplied: RANSW)\n\nNot enough to go around\n\nWagga Wagga, Orange and Armidale were among the other regional centres to miss out on the four-year funding, which Regional Arts NSW chief executive Tracey Callinan said was received by only three galleries.\n\n\"We're now really concerned that those regional galleries across the state are going to struggle to produce good work,\" she said.\n\n\" They'll just put the existing collections on the walls and do as little as possible, because you can't do it with no money. \"\n\nKelly Leonard says the funding shortfall shows a lack of understanding of the importance of art. (ABC Broken Hill: Oliver Brown)\n\nThe funding is offered in two, four and eight-year cycles and Broken Hill council hopes to be named as a recipient of two years' worth of funding in September.\n\n\"The gallery works at least two years ahead on planning for exhibitions, so it really needs that long-term funding support,\" Ms Leonard said.\n\nThe ABC contacted NSW Arts Minister John Graham for comment and received a statement from a Create NSW spokesperson who said the ACFP was highly competitive.\n\n\"The NSW government recognises the significant contributions made by regional art galleries to the arts and culture ecology across regional NSW,\" they said.\n\n\"The full funding profile of support for regional galleries will be available following the assessment of the two-year funding program.\"",

You just have to hunt for it and be willing to try. \"\n\nGPS-guided tractors are gaining popularity on farms as growers streamline operations. (ABC News: Tayla Larsen)\n\nMr Gatt started using the technology 15 years ago and now has more than 20 GPS tractors across his properties.\n\n\"The next step we'll be going to is instead of doing a single row we'll be going to three-row machines,\" he said.\n\n\"Anything we can do to get labour down or get it more efficient we're definitely working towards.\n\n\"People don't realise that it's not just that wage that you're getting, it's also your superannuation and all the other expenses on top of that.\"\n\nThe quiet crisis in Australian farming Photo shows Photo of a man crouching down on a field. Australian farm productivity is in decline, prompting calls for policy reform as experts warn high yields are masking deeper issues.\n\nAround the country more growers like Mr Gatt are investing heavily up-front, exploring automation and simplifying old processes to remain viable.\n\nIn the latest benchmarking report from Level Up Hort \u2014 a program funded by grower-owned research corporation Hort Innovation to improve business performance \u2014 workforce efficiency was a critical factor in overall profitability.\n\n\"There's been a lot of discussion around labour, increased costs of labour and challenges with securing and retaining labour,\" said project leader Steff Carstairs.\n\n\"In general, labour continues to be a pain point for horticultural businesses, and a major cost.\n\n\"Those who seem to be doing better have greater efficiencies around their labour management.\"\n\nJason Gatt says upgrading farm machinery and technology has cut labour costs. (ABC News: Tayla Larsen)\n\nThe report, which represents businesses producing 5,596 hectares of vegetables and onions across six states, showed the most profitable growers spent the equivalent of about a third of their income on labour.\n\nFor the least profitable farms that figure rose to 51 per cent.\n\nRichard Shannon, the executive officer of the National Farmers Federation's Horticulture Council, said over the past five years business costs had gone up significantly, but grower returns had not.\n\n\"That's across the board \u2014 all other inputs have gone up at the same time,\" he said.\n\n\"That's led to a big squeeze across the industry and everyone's feeling the pinch.\"\n\nNot shying away from new solutions\n\nThe latest contribution to the squeeze is the minimum wage which rose by 3.5 per cent from $24.10 to $24.95 per hour on July 1.\n\nRather than an hourly rate, workers covered by the Horticulture Award can be paid a piece rate based on how much they plant, pick, sort and pack fruit and vegetables.\n\nThey are also guaranteed to receive at least the national minimum wage.\n\nFair Work Ombudsman Anna Booth said that meant all workers would be paid more.\n\n\"We obviously apply that to all the awards, and in particular the horticulture awards, so you can see how that works in with the piece rate,\" she said.\n\nMr Shannon urged growers who were looking for creative solutions to reduce their wage bill to do their homework and get advice before making an expensive decision.\n\n\"Ideally visiting other farms, getting on an industry tour, whether that's domestic or overseas, just to get a better idea of what their options are,\" he said.\n\n\"I guess the old adage is to be working more on your business rather than in your business.\n\n\" As business owners and people who are in leadership positions the tendency is to get stuck dealing with day-to-day evolving issues rather than taking that longer look into the medium and longer term, and thinking more strategically. \"\n\nRay Fulcher uses hydroponics to grow figs in a temperature controlled greenhouse. (ABC News: Tayla Larsen)\n\nWhen Bundaberg producer Ray Fulcher transitioned from small crops to custard apples and figs it forced him to take a more strategic look at his growing methods.\n\nIt was a long process to determine the optimal conditions for his figs, which are grown in a greenhouse previously used for roses.\n\n\"It's all temperature controlled and humidity controlled to a degree,\" he said.\n\n\"The irrigation is all hydroponic and it makes life very simple for a grower \u2026 but it's very expensive.\n\n\"Those greenhouses when I put them in cost about $2 million and most average people can't afford that.\"\n\nRay Fulcher can control the conditions of his fig greenhouse with the press of a button. (ABC News: Tayla Larsen)\n\nMr Fulcher adapted his workforce too, moving to labour hire contractors to get in a certain number of workers at specific times in the season.\n\n\"We can't find enough good workers,\" he said.\n\n\"To be honest probably young people don't really like that environment that we're in.\n\n\"In winter it's very comfortable working conditions, but in summer it's horrendous.\"\n\nMr Fulcher said growers had to accept labour costs were a part of doing business and should focus on optimising the workforce.\n\n\"You want to do it?

        "text": "Josh Papalii will play his final State of Origin match on Wednesday night as he returns from a three-year representative retirement to try to help lead Queensland to victory in the decider.\n\nPapalii was already a seminal figure in Maroons history and his comeback ensures him a unique piece of history \u2014 unless Daly Cherry-Evans plays on and earns a recall next year, Papalii, who made his interstate debut in 2013, will be the last active player from Queensland's legendary eight in a row Origin dynasty.\n\nABC Sport will have live blog coverage of the State of Origin series.\n\nCoach Billy Slater will be looking for inspiration, leadership and muscle up front from the veteran front-rower, who is the latest in a long tradition of Origin stars to return from representative retirement to the game's toughest arena.\n\nComing back into the crucible of representative football is no easy thing, even accounting for Papalii's strong recent form with the Raiders.\n\nHere's how each Origin returnee has fared upon their comeback to interstate football.\n\nAllan Langer \u2014 2001\n\nLanger's return to State of Origin is the stuff of Queensland legend. (AAP)\n\nThe gold standard of Origin comebacks, Langer's selection for the 2001 decider while playing for English club Warrington three years after his last appearance in maroon has become the stuff of legend.\n\nAt 35, Langer's best years were supposed to be well behind him and there were contingencies in place should he turn down the chance at a recall \u2014 Maroons coach Wayne Bennett had also sounded out former Parramatta and Canterbury five-eighth Jason Smith, who was also playing in England at the time.\n\nBut Langer opted in and inspired Queensland to a famous 40-14 victory at QEII Stadium, scoring a try on one of his state's most famous nights.\n\nIt kicked off a late-career renaissance for Langer, who returned to the Broncos in 2002 and played all three matches for Queensland again that season.\n\nJust a few weeks shy of his 36th birthday, he earned man of the match honours in that year's drawn Origin decider, which ensured the Maroons would retain the shield.\n\nBrad Fittler \u2014 2004\n\nBrad Fittler scored the final try in the 2004 Origin decider, retiring from representative football with a series win for NSW. (AAP: Mick Tsikas)\n\nLanger's Origin return spoiled the party for New South Wales five-eighth and captain Brad Fittler, who called time on his own representative career after the 2001 decider.\n\nThe Roosters' mainstay continued his excellent form in the seasons to come and in 2004, with the Blues suffering an injury crisis in the halves heading into Game II, Fittler was asked to return by coach Phil Gould and accepted the chance for one more shot at Origin glory.\n\nFittler's return ended in defeat, courtesy of Billy Slater's miracle chip and chase try, but the champion five-eighth returned for the decider in Sydney.\n\nAt 32, and 14 years after he became the youngest ever NSW State of Origin player to that point, Fittler enjoyed a dream farewell by scoring the final try of a 36-14 New South Wales rout to finally go out on a high.\n\nJosh Morris \u2014 2019\n\nMorris made a belated comeback to Origin after three years in retirement. (AAP: Glenn Hunt )\n\nA stone-cold New South Wales legend for his battles with Greg Inglis and his efforts fighting through a serious knee injury in the 2014 series opener, Morris had a low-key representative retirement following the 2016 series.\n\nThree years later, with Brad Fittler short of options at right centre for Game I, he recalled the then 32-year-old Cronulla flyer for his 15th State of Origin appearance.\n\nMorris acquitted himself well, scoring the opening try of the night at Lang Park, but was dumped for Tom Trbojevic following New South Wales's 18-14 loss and never played for the Blues again.\n\nMatt Sing \u2014 2005\n\nSing's Origin retirement lasted just a few months before his return. (AAP: Tony Phillips )\n\nOne of the most underrated Origin players of his time, Sing holds the record for the shortest-lived representative retirement of modern times.\n\nIn 2004, nine years after making his Test and Origin debuts, Sing hung up the boots for Queensland and Australia in an effort to prolong his club career and spend more time with family.\n\nHowever, after a change of heart, Sing made himself available for the 2005 Anzac Test and subsequent Origin series. He played all three matches for the Maroons but gave it up for good following Queensland's loss in the decider.\n\nBraz Izzard \u2014 1991\n\nWhy Queensland's unlikely Origin debutant was always meant to make it Photo shows A man celebrates after scoring a try in an NRL match After putting the journey into journeyman, Gehamat Shibasaki will become one of Queensland's most unlikely Origin debutants and his long road to the decider has taken him right back to where he started.\n\nIzzard's return to State of Origin isn't quite a comeback from representative retirement, but the sheer wait between appearances earns the Penrith stalwart a special mention.\n\nAfter playing all three games for New South Wales in the 1982 series, where he scored two tries, Izzard had to wait another nine years for his second Blues call-up, which came in the 1991 decider.\n\nTo this day, Izzard holds the record for longest gap between Origin appearances, a mark that is unlikely to ever be broken.\n\nCameron Smith and Andrew Johns \u2014 the near misses\n\nTwo of the greatest players in their respective states' histories retired from rep football a few years before hanging up the boots, but both came perilously close to backflipping on the decision.\n\nFor Johns, who made a magical return to the Blue jersey in 2005 after missing almost the entire prior 12 months through injury, it came in 2006 when he seriously considered returning for that year's decider before opting out. Queensland went on to secure a dramatic series win that propelled them to their famous eight-in-a-row dynasty.\n\nAs for Smith, who was sounded out more than once after he played his final game for Queensland in 2017, the closest he ever came seems to be 2019 when he was in conversation with Maroons coach Kevin Walters but ultimately decided against returning.",

You know, I didn't hire you because you're an amazing character actor \u2014 all due respect \u2014 I want Hughesy'.\n\n\"I love the idea of this show [going] international, that Hughesy will be the voice of the goblin next door that's constantly feuding with Wizz.\"\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nLee's 'big learning'\n\nLee said part of the extra time it took to make the show was crafting hand-drawn expressions or movements for the characters.\n\nWhile the animation used 3D technology to produce Wizz and friends' basic movements, any adjustments Lee or the team wanted were made by hand by illustrator Heath McKenzie.\n\n\"The amount of drawings has been quite incredible,\" Lee said.\n\n\"To give you an idea of just Wizz's expressions, I think we ended up with 60 mouth shapes.\"\n\nThe opportunities to tweak or change the animation were \"endless\". (Supplied)\n\nRetaining creative control was a priority for Lee, and was part of the reason talks with a Hollywood studio for the show didn't come to fruition.\n\nBut Lee himself says being so deeply involved in the show's creation was both a blessing and a curse.\n\n\"The strange thing about making an animation versus a live action is we used to go out and film something and we'd get back into the edit and I'd go 'Oh do we have a shot of that? Oh no, we don't, OK well that's all it is,'\" he said.\n\n\"Now I sit in the edit and go '[It] would've been good if he kind of fell from the ceiling here' and the editor goes 'OK, well let's just draw that in.'\n\n\"The problem is it's endless, you could keep changing things.\n\n\"That was my big learning: 'OK, there has to be a point where you can't creatively keep changing it because otherwise this thing will never get finished.'\"\n\nLuxury of no nerves\n\nGiven the effort it's taken to bring Wizz to life on the screen, is Lee nervous about sharing the show with the world?\n\n\"Not until you said that,\" he joked.\n\n\"No, not really. I suppose I've had the benefit of making them and you watch them back and ... watch every frame and ponder it.\n\n\" At the end of that process, I tend to just be very excited for people to see it. \"\n\nWhile Lee says he's not nervous for the show's release, he admits his measure of success has \"never been a numbers\" game.\n\n\"As I get slightly older \u2014 gosh that's an old person thing to say \u2014 it's certainly more about how much fun you have,\" he said.\n\n\"It's so hard when you release something, you never know how it's going to go and there's so many things that can dictate how something resonates.\n\n\"It's important not to hang too much on the results because that would be a pretty nerve-wracking game.\"\n\nStream Do Not Watch This Show free on ABC iview.",

        "text": "And so we return to where we began almost six months ago.\n\nFollowing an external review and months of outrage in the arts community, the artist Khaled Sabsabi and curator Michael Dagostino are once again Australia's representatives to the 2026 Venice Biennale, after Creative Australia's latest backflip.\n\nThe February decision to remove the pair \u2014 a week after their Biennale selection was celebrated \u2014 led to Creative Australia resignations, damaged the funding body's relationship with the arts sector, and sullied the public reputation of an artist.\n\nKhaled Sabsabi reinstated for Venice Biennale Photo shows A man standing in front of a blue painting smiles gently After controversially and suddenly withdrawing Khaled Sabsabi and Michael Dagostino from the 2026 Venice Biennale, Creative Australia has announced it has reversed its decision.\n\nSabsabi and Dagostino said in a statement that having their Biennale selection reinstated \"offers a sense of resolution and allows us to move forward with optimism and hope after a period of significant personal and collective hardship\".\n\nAnd while acting Creative Australia chair Wesley Enoch praised the board's \"very big heart\" for engaging in a review of the decision to scrap Sabsabi \"with integrity and thoughtfulness and mov[ing] forward\", the impacts of the month-long arts scandal will not immediately be forgotten.\n\nNor does Sabsabi's reinstatement mean that the many questions surrounding his Biennale saga are now answered.\n\n\"The [external] review, for all the detail, does not actually clarify the decision-to-cancel process,\" Adelaide Writers Week director and senior arts commentator Louise Adler says.\n\n\"What we do know is that the decision to cancel [Sabsabi and Dagostino] was a reaction to political pressure.\"\n\n\"Though we will be stronger as a sector because of [Creative Australia's review], I know that it's come at a personal cost. Not just to them, but to a whole range of people in the art sector,\" Enoch says. (Supplied: Sydney Festival)\n\nWhy the snap decision?\n\nAfter concerns were raised in February in parliament by senator Claire Chandler and in The Australian newspaper about two of Sabsabi's earlier artworks, Creative Australia's board scheduled an emergency meeting and came to a unanimous decision to withdraw the Venice Biennale commission.\n\nAt a later Senate Estimates, when senator Sarah Hanson-Young asked Creative Australia CEO Adrian Collette why legal advice had not been sought prior to the decision being made, it led to the following exchange:\n\nAdrian Collette \u2014 We didn't have time. Sarah Hanson-Young \u2014 You didn't have time? AC \u2014 No, we didn't have time. SHY \u2014 According to who? AC \u2014 According to us. We had to make that decision very quickly.\n\nEsther Anatolitis, the editor of Meanjin and former executive director of the National Association for the Visual Arts (NAVA), says it's still unclear why that was the case.\n\n\"The issue really is, what was the hurry? And why did they perceive that as a crisis, when all that happened was that there was one critical and factually incorrect attack on the work which, as Blackhall and Pearl's report says, was capable of being defended by Creative Australia.\"\n\nReinstating Sabsabi and Dagostino \"was the only possible decision\", Anatolitis says. \"It's such an important step for rebuilding all of the trust and confidence that's needed now.\" (Supplied: Sarah Walker)\n\nInstead, the board's decision to drop Sabsabi sparked a massive backlash from the arts community, and a review was commissioned to examine the process, but not the merit, of the decisions that were made.\n\nThe review's report states that Creative Australia was not \"appropriately prepared\" for \"what, inevitably, was going to be a controversial decision\".\n\nThe report notes that the process of selecting Sabsabi and Dagostino was generally the same as it had been for 2024's representative, Archie Moore, who won the Golden Lion for his work at the Biennale.\n\nBut \"the external social and political context, particularly in late January-early February 2025, was profoundly different.\"\n\nIt wasn't Sabsabi's proposal for the Biennale that was contentious, though.\n\nDropped artist Sabsabi speaks out Photo shows Khaled Sabsabi with serious expression looks into camera, which is very close to his face. He has stubble on his chin, cheeks. Artist Khaled Sabsabi has said the decades-old artworks that triggered Creative Australia's decision to dump him have been \"grossly misrepresented\".\n\nInstead, the report notes: \"The source of potential controversy was seen to lie in the fact of selecting any artist with heritage connected to the Middle East at a time when conflict in that region was so emotive and polarising.\"\n\nAdler says it beggars belief that this climate was not sufficiently considered by Creative Australia.\n\n\"There's not an arts organisation in the country that hasn't had to provide their increasingly risk-averse boards with risk assessments.\n\n\"If Creative Australia was blindsided by the complexities of inviting Sabsabi, it suggests either a worrying level of naivety or a political judgement that a Brown artist from the western suburbs will tick a whole lot of boxes.\n\n\" Either rationale suggests that Creative Australia is not fit for purpose. \"\n\nLouise Adler has been vocal in calling out what is, in her view, a prevailing failure of cultural leaders to manage risk. (Supplied: Adelaide Festival)\n\nLattouf parallel\n\nCreative Australia's actions don't exist in a vacuum.\n\nA court found this month that the ABC had unfairly terminated Antoinette Lattouf because of her political opinion. Justice Darryl Rangiah found external pressure from \"pro-Israel lobbyists\" had played a role in the ABC's decision. The ABC's new managing director, Hugh Marks, has since conceded the ABC acted out of turn.\n\nAnatolitis argues that the Lattouf matter is \"a parallel example of a privileged bypassing of a normal rigorous complaints procedure \u2026 knowing that it would fail \u2026 in order to achieve the outcome that the vexatious complainants intended\".\n\nThe ABC's own goal should be a moment of reflection Photo shows A woman is seen from the shoulders up standing in front of a flag The ABC tried to dodge complaints and attention by firing Antoinette Lattouf. Ironically the broadcaster earned more scrutiny.\n\nAdler also draws a link between the two events.\n\n\"As with the suppression of the names of the \"Lawyers for Israel\" who campaigned for Lattouf's sacking, those who briefed Senator Chandler will probably never be outed,\" Adler says.\n\nA knock-on effect?\n\nShortly after Creative Australia announced it had dropped Sabsabi, Monash University decided to postpone an exhibition curated by Stolon Press at their gallery, MUMA, featuring artwork by Sabsabi.\n\n\"There's no question that Creative Australia's decision to cancel the invitation to Michael and to Khaled influenced Monash's decision to postpone the Stolon Press exhibition,\" Rebecca Coates, the director of MUMA, says.\n\n\"We were dealing with a very singular interpretation of two still images from a very complex moving image artwork that were being used \u2026 as a means of progressing an argument.\n\n\" That to me says that this is culture wars, and our art and artists are being used as fuel to promote and promulgate a particular position. \"\n\nIn May, Monash University also backflipped on its decision to \"indefinitely postpone\" its exhibition featuring Sabsabi, and in June the exhibition opened.\n\nCoates believes that has had an influence on the national arts funding body.\n\n\"I think Monash's decision to subsequently proceed with the Stolon Press exhibition, which included Khaled's contribution as a collaborator, was inevitably part of the context in which Creative Australia decided to proceed with Khaled and Michael's representation at Venice,\" she says.\n\nCoates believes Monash University's decision to go ahead with an exhibition featuring Sabsabi's work had national influence. (Supplied)\n\nThe need to be 'more rigorous'\n\nMany within the arts have celebrated Sabsabi and Dagostino's reinstatement.\n\nHowever, opposition to the selection remains. Julian Leeser, shadow minister for the arts, told ABC Radio National Breakfast: \"I think Creative Australia's made the wrong decision. The representative of Australia on the world stage should reflect our values and to reinstate this artist as our representative at Biennale and to give them taxpayers' funds I think flies in the face of those values.\n\n\"Creative Australia has responsibilities to the taxpayer and the broader Australian community. I believe those issues continue to remain and that I believe Creative Australia should not have unmade their decision that they previously made to withdraw Mr Sabsabi from this exhibition at this time,\" he said.\n\nCoates interprets the decision differently; she see it as \"a signal of renewal, growth and connectedness and, I believe, a shared future\".\n\nEnoch has apologised to Sabsabi and Agostino for \"the hurt and pain\" and \"personal cost\" of Creative Australia's decisions. And he acknowledged that risk must, in future, be better considered.\n\n\"Some of these issues are coming up at such a rapid pace that the systems that were relevant to us even two years ago are no longer fit for purpose. And we, as a sector, have to be engaged in much more rigorous conversations around the messaging, the risk assessment, and how we go forward.\"\n\nFor his part, Sabsabi told Nine newspapers in April: \"I'm an artist, not a politician.\n\n\"And my work for over 35 years is about finding ways to converse through complexity.\"\n\nHe may now be in a position to hold that conversation a little more freely.",

(ABC Coffs Coast: Claire Simmonds)\n\nMr Tunstead said the seven-week wait for category D funding \"wasn't ideal at all\".\n\n\" After the Lismore floods was announced in three days and after the 2021 floods it was announced in seven days, this being seven weeks, it was tough on all the farmers. \"\n\n\"It still won't cover what I lost and what a lot of farmers lost, but it will give us some reassurance to rebuild and safeguard for the future.\"\n\nHowever, he foresees some oyster growers will be unable to continue operating, regardless of disaster relief grants, as Sydney rock oysters \"take three years to regrow from a baby oyster to a mature oyster\".\n\n\"Some farmers may still go under, as I was speaking to someone farming on the Macleay [River] yesterday and he was looking at off-lease work in the mines.\"\n\nMr Tunstead said he had plans on how to spend his $75,000 grant if successful in his application.\n\n\"What I'm planning on doing is buying a heap of half-grown oysters with the money so it's only 12 months without an income.\"\n\nWingham Riverside Reserve was badly impacted by the flooding. (Supplied: MidCoast Council)\n\nNSW Minister for Agriculture Tara Moriarty said in a statement that affected farmers should contact the state's Rural Assistance Authority as soon as possible to make an application for extra assistance.\n\n\"We have seen the destructive impact of the floods and talked with dairy, oyster and other farmers who have being doing it tough,\" she said.\n\n\"This decision, with the Commonwealth, again shows our commitment to helping farmers get their businesses back to producing great produce.\"",

        "text": "England has stumbled to 3-77 to trail India by 510 runs on day two of the second Test, after Indian skipper Shubman Gill scored a record-breaking 269 and their seamers struck early to put the tourists in a commanding position at Edgbaston.\n\nIndia was charged up when Akash Deep picked up two wickets in two balls before Mohammed Siraj also got in on the act to clean up England's top order and leave them tottering at 3-25 on what had been a good batting wicket.\n\nBen Duckett nicked a ball to third slip where Gill took a smart diving catch before Ollie Pope fell the very next delivery for a duck when Deep drew an edge and the ball flew to KL Rahul in the slips.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nDropped catches had cost India the first Test at Headingley but this time they stuck as Siraj drew an edge from Zak Crawley to find Karun Nair at first slip.\n\n\"Fielding was definitely one of those things we spoke about as a team, and it's great to see that come off so far,\" Gill told Sky Sports.\n\n\"This game was all about confidence. We spoke about if we scored 400 again, batting first or batting second, we would be right in the game.\"\n\nHarry Brook (30) survived a review for LBW thanks to the umpire's call but he and Joe Root (18) absorbed the pressure to see out the day with an unbeaten 52-run partnership.\n\nEarlier, Gill became the first Indian to score more than 250 outside the Indian subcontinent, breaking Sachin Tendulkar's record of 241, while he also recorded the highest score by an India captain when he went past Virat Kohli's 254.\n\nGill had hardly put a foot wrong over the first two days of the Test but he briefly lost his concentration after tea when he tried to dispatch a short ball from Josh Tongue, only to find Pope at square leg.\n\nBut the Edgbaston crowd rose to their feet to salute the captain's knock as he walked back to the pavilion, his job done after the Indians found themselves reeling at 5-211 on day one.\n\n\"I worked on a few things before the series that I thought might be important for me going into Test cricket,\" said Gill, who has scored 424 runs in the series.\n\n\"Looking at the results, they are working for me.\"\n\nHaving resumed on an overnight score of 5-310, Jadeja and Gill had built a 203-run stand before the all-rounder fell to a Tongue bouncer but Gill looked completely at ease on a flat track that offered precious little assistance.\n\nAs England's bowling attack toiled under the summer sun, Gill hardly broke sweat and put a high price on his wicket as he showcased his array of elegant drives and well-timed flicks to pile on the runs.\n\nGill made his trademark bow once again after becoming the first India skipper to score a double-hundred in England and soon broke Sunil Gavaskar's 46-year-old record for the highest score by an Indian in England (221 in 1979).\n\nCan't get enough cricket from Grandstand? Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.\n\nHe was soon toying with the attack and the placement of fielders, coolly switching between sublime and unorthodox shots as he dispatched the ball to all corners of the ground.\n\nWith Washington Sundar playing patiently at the other end, Gill was in Twenty20 mode as they cruised past the 500-mark and a rare outside edge went for a boundary to take the captain to 250.\n\nRoot finally broke the seventh-wicket partnership of 144 when a delivery broke through the defence of Sundar as he departed for a well-made 42.\n\nIndia's tail added only 13 runs after Gill's dismissal, but that gave their bowlers 20 overs to take a crack at England's batters on a fruitful day as they look to level the series.\n\nReuters",

        "text": "The rare but deadly lyssavirus has now claimed four lives in Australia.\n\nNew South Wales Health confirmed a man aged in his 50s from the state's north died from the virus on Thursday after being bitten by a bat several months ago.\n\nIt was the first known case in NSW.\n\nHere's what we know about the disease.\n\nThousands of little red flying foxes leave the gardens on dusk in search of food. (Supplied: Jurgen Freund)\n\nWhat is lyssavirus?\n\nLyssavirus is a rabies-like infection transmitted via a bite or scratch from an infected bat to humans and other mammals, such as dogs and cats, or by exposure to an infected animal's saliva through the eyes, nose or mouth.\n\nNSW Health says lyssavirus affects the central nervous system and can take anywhere from weeks to years to present.\n\nThe early symptoms are flu-like and include headache, fever and fatigue.\n\nThe illness progresses rapidly to paralysis, delirium and convulsions.\n\nDeath usually follows within a fortnight.\n\nA tiny proportion of bats carry the virus, but extreme caution is recommended when the animals are present. (ABC Capricornia: Katrina Beavan)\n\nAustralian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) has been found in species of flying foxes, fruit bats and insect-eating microbats, and has been detected in NSW, the Northern Territory, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia.\n\nThe CSIRO first identified the Australian bat lyssavirus in 1996 after a black flying fox was found displaying nervous symptoms near Ballina in northern NSW.\n\nLater that year a Queensland woman who had recently become a bat handler started to suffer numbness and weakness in her arm before falling into a coma and dying.\n\nIn 1998 and 2013, respectively, a woman and an eight-year-old died after they were bitten or scratched by bats.\n\nAn extremely rare virus\n\nUniversity of Sydney veterinary scientist Alison Peel said bats had coevolved with lyssavirus over a number of years.\n\n\"We know that a large number of bats have been exposed to the virus but not gone on to have clinical signs that they ultimately die of,\" she said.\n\n\"It's a small proportion of bats that go on to develop those clinical signs, whereas in people and other animals it ultimately causes those clinical signs.\n\n\" With any of those animals, once there are clinical signs, then it almost always ends in death. \"\n\nDr Peel said it was yet to be understood why some bats were resistant to the disease and that infected bats often exhibited erratic and aggressive behaviour.\n\nTrish Paterson with a black bat at her home in Rathdowney. (Supplied: Trish Paterson)\n\nTrish Paterson, who ran the Australian Bat Clinic and Wildlife Trauma Centre in Queensland, said less than 0.1 per cent of the Australian bat population was infected with lyssavirus.\n\n\"They catch it from a bite or a scratch from an infected bat, so the bats die from it exactly the same away we do, and it\u2019s nasty, very painful, and can take three to four weeks for an animal to die once they\u2019ve contracted lyssavirus,\" she said.\n\nMs Paterson said being fully vaccinated against rabies was crucial for anyone who handled bats and that it was worrying that another person had died from an infection despite receiving prompt medical attention.\n\n\"If he received treatment and still contracted the virus, that would be a little bit concerning,\" she said.\n\nBats roosting above Trish Paterson's home in Queensland. (Supplied: Trish Paterson)\n\nPost-exposure treatment\n\nThere is no cure for lyssavirus but there are measures that can limit the likelihood of a person developing the disease, including the rabies vaccine.\n\n\"ABLV is closely enough related to rabies that all of the preventative measures developed around the world for rabies, including vaccines and post-exposure treatment, work against ABLV,\" Dr Peel said.\n\nShe said the vaccinations were vital for anyone coming into contact with bats, including carers, veterinarians and wildlife officers.\n\nDr Peel said anyone bitten or scratched by a bat should immediately wash the wound thoroughly for 15 minutes with soap and water and apply an antiviral antiseptic before allowing the affected area to dry.\n\nAnyone who sees a bat in distress is urged not to attempt to come to its aid. (Supplied: Brad Leue)\n\nPost-exposure treatment involves getting a course of the rabies vaccine and potentially a dose of antibodies.\n\n\"You're giving your immune system a head start rather than waiting for it to develop those antibodies,\" Dr Peel said.\n\n\" That just helps to attack the virus straight away. \"\n\nDr Peel said it was rare for post-exposure treatment to fail.\n\nThere is no cure once the disease is detected in the body.\n\nPeople are advised to avoid contact with bats and call WIRES on 1300 094 737 if they find a bat in distress, injured or trapped on the ground.",

        "text": "Australia's middle order rescues the team again as Cameron Green fails to cash in on his best start in a year in Grenada.\n\nHere are five quick hits from the first day of the second Test against the West Indies. Tap here for the full match report and re-live the overnight blog.\n\n1. Konstas came to play\n\nKonstas was bright early on day one in Grenada. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nAfter a battling return to the Test team yielded just eight runs in Barbados, young Sam Konstas became something of a personification of the Australian top order's struggles.\n\nThe 19-year-old opener looked unsure at the crease in the opening Test, but there were no such concerns in the opening exchanges at St George's.\n\nKonstas showed plenty of that overused word \"intent\", turning the second ball of the match for a single, then clattering his next delivery (Shamar Joseph's first) over square leg for four with a glorious pull shot.\n\nOne thing was for sure, Konstas was going to take the game on in Grenada.\n\nHe and Usman Khawaja ultimately found the rope six times in the first hour before falling in successive overs.\n\n2. Smith can't prevent another collapse\n\nSmith was dismissed cheaply on his return to the Test arena. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nDespite their team securing a 159-run victory, Australia's top four had a disastrous first Test in Barbados, combining for 105 runs from eight underwhelming innings.\n\nHowever, with Steve Smith back in the side for the second Test, there was an expectation the veteran would firm things up in Grenada.\n\nThat's not how it played out.\n\nSmith came to the crease after Khawaja and Konstas had been dismissed in consecutive overs and his idiosyncrasies were on display from ball one, crab walking across the crease and leaving pronouncedly.\n\nBut only six balls into his innings \u2014 and just after he had taken a kid moving behind the bowler rather personally \u2014 Smith was caught in the deep trying to pull Alzarri Joseph for six.\n\nThe returning vice-captain was out for three and Australia had gone from 0-47 to 3-50.\n\n3. Green gets a life \u2026 and wastes it\n\nIn the penultimate over before lunch, Cameron Green lofted a wide Shamar Joseph delivery over cover for four.\n\nFour balls later, he chipped a similar ball to cover, where John Campbell grassed a straightforward chance.\n\nFour after that, he got another look at a wide ball he could have easily left alone, but threw his hands at it instead and this time edged to a sure-handed Roston Chase at gully.\n\nIt was the last ball before lunch no matter what and ended not only his best Test innings in over a year but also cut short a useful recovery effort with Travis Head.\n\n4. Carey's counterpunch\n\nIn a year so far defined by Australian top-order collapses, Alex Carey has quietly come into his own as a counter-attacking middle order batter.\n\nHis calm head and flashing hands have earned him a 2025 average well into the 60s and a strike rate of almost 80.\n\nCarey has been in excellent form so far in 2025. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nComing to the crease at 5-110, Carey was positive from ball one in Grenada.\n\nWith Beau Webster struggling for fluency up the other end, Carey pulled authoritatively and drove attractively to put some pressure back on the West Indian bowlers.\n\nIt was another key innings from the Australian wicketkeeper, who combined with the increasingly comfortable Webster for the tourists' best partnership of the day.\n\nCarey cantered to the 11th half century of his Test match career but not before he was dropped by wicketkeeper Shai Hope on 46.\n\nCarey led Australia's fight back on day one in Grenada. (AP: Ricardo Mazalan)\n\nIt was the hosts' eighth, and perhaps most consequential, drop of the series so far.\n\n5. Seeing the funny side\n\nWhen a fast bowler lands a short ball then has a batter bowled off the next delivery, you'd think it was a perfectly executed set-up, but that wasn't exactly the case with the dismissal of Pat Cummins.\n\nYes, Alzarri Joseph's bouncer forced him back in the crease, but the ball that collected stumps was pitched for another rib-tickler and it just refused to get up.\n\nIt ultimately grazed Cummins halfway up his pads before caroming into the stumps, with Joseph and even umpire Richard Kettleborough unable to stifle their chuckles at the ridiculous variable bounce late on day one of a Test match.\n\nAs joyous as it always is getting a wicket, no doubt there were a few West Indian batters grimacing when they saw that one go underground.",

        "text": "Health insurer Bupa has been accused of ongoing unscrupulous behaviour towards its customers amid legal action by the competition watchdog.\n\nABC News has been contacted by patients and medical practices from around the country concerned legitimate claims have been denied.\n\nConcerns were also raised about poor communication with patients, problematic billing practices, and lack of education among Bupa staff.\n\nEarlier this week, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission fined the health insurer $35 million for unlawfully rejecting thousands of claims between May 2018 and August 2023.\n\nBupa in court for 'unconscionable conduct' Photo shows Bupa One of Australia's largest private health insurers has paid back millions of dollars to thousands of members who had hospital claims incorrectly rejected.\n\nBupa rejected claims in full when only part of a procedure was not covered.\n\nThe insurer admitted to engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct.\n\nBut Brisbane woman Tara Manning says she believes poor conduct has not stopped since she experienced difficulty with a claim in April 2025 \u2014 about 18 months after the period dealt with by the ACCC.\n\nShe said Bupa tried to reject a claim for laparoscopic surgery to investigate possible ovarian cancer when she went through the pre-surgery eligibility check.\n\nThe mother-of-two had bronze-level cover that included cover for gynaecological surgery. But because one part of the procedure was deemed \"digestive\" by the insurer and the government, the claim was initially rejected in full.\n\nMother-of-two Tara Manning had bronze-level cover with Bupa. (Supplied)\n\nFacing a $14,000 bill, Ms Manning spent weeks calling and messaging BUPA ahead of her surgery and only had her claim approved hours after she submitted a complaint to the Commonwealth Ombudsman.\n\n\"It was an incredibly stressful time trying to get a hold of Bupa with wait times on the phone over an hour,\" she said.\n\n\"I was told very mixed opinions throughout the whole process.\n\n\" I think that behaviour has been really appalling. \"\n\nBupa said it could not comment on individual cases.\n\nIt said the ACCC case related to errors that occurred because of inaccurate or unclear instructions, training or guidance which meant Bupa did not always make correct assessments of these claims and eligibility checks or act quickly enough to fix these issues.\n\n\"We are deeply sorry for our failure to get this right in these instances. We know this isn't good enough and we're committed to doing better.\"\n\nSkin cancer patients facing out-of-pocket expenses despite cover\n\nPlastic surgery clinics also said their bronze cover patients were repeatedly having problems with Bupa when it came to skin cancer removals.\n\nWhen patients needed a cancer surgically removed, they sometimes required a small skin graft or flap to cover the wound which Bupa deemed to be plastic surgery.\n\nPlastic surgery was only covered under silver policies, leaving patients with out-of-pocket expenses of up to $4,500.\n\nJane Griffiths, chief executive officer of peak group Day Hospitals Australia, said private health legislation stated that plastic surgery related to skin surgery was, in fact, covered at bronze level.\n\nShe said their members regularly experienced this from Bupa.\n\n\"You can't leave a patient without a closed skin lesion,\" she said.\n\nDo you have a story to share? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au\n\nBupa said this was an industry-wide problem to do with automated billing and patients needed manual overrides.\n\nIt was raised with the federal government in 2021 but recommendations for reform were yet to be implemented.\n\nIn response, medical practices told ABC News other insurers had better processes to override the problem, whereas poorly trained Bupa staff would meet requests for overrides with \"a blanket no\" and the inability to escalate the issue.\n\nMany patients were also unaware of the issue and simply paid the gap, the medical practices said.\n\n\"We are working with hospitals and medical practices to make this process smoother,\" a Bupa spokesperson said.\n\nJane Griffiths is CEO of peak group Day Hospitals Australia. (ABC News: Ben Tessler)\n\nBupa also refused to cover more than one surgical billing item a day, while other insurers would cover two or three, Ms Griffiths said.\n\nThis could be a problem for several types of procedures, including ophthalmology and chemotherapy which involved more than one element, and especially for skin cancers.\n\n\"If the patient needs to be covered for [multiple cancers], you would have to keep bringing the patient in multiple times which of course is not desirable for the patient or for the surgeon,\" Ms Griffiths said.\n\n\" It is a real problem and it's very confusing. \"\n\nBupa said different health insurers took different approaches to funding same-day procedures.\n\nBupa is Australia's second-largest private health insurer.\n\nFigures from the Commonwealth Ombudsman show 2024 complaint numbers were largely in proportion to its market share.\n\nPatient should have declared 'sign' of heart disease\n\nQueensland man David Anderson said he was left with a $48,000 bill for triple bypass heart surgery in 2022 after Bupa denied his claim.\n\nHe said the insurer delved into his medical records and discovered what it deemed a \"sign\" of heart disease and claimed it was a pre-existing condition.\n\nThat was despite three of his treating doctors signing statutory declarations that he was symptom-free prior to taking out the policy.\n\n\"I had climbed a mountain in Canada two months prior to diagnosis,\" he said.\n\nBupa declined to comment on individual cases but said under law those with pre-existing conditions were not covered even if it was discovered after a policy was taken out and the patient was symptom-free.\n\n\"What private health insurers can cover is limited by private health insurance legislation.\"\n\nBupa has reached an agreement with the ACCC on a proposed penalty of $35 million. (ABC News: Nic MacBean)\n\nBupa's market power makes it hard for small operators\n\nMs Griffiths said day hospital operators had a lot of difficulties with Bupa compared to other insurers and \"to some extent\" they were abusing their market power.\n\nShe said Bupa was difficult to deal with in negotiations for their contracts with private hospitals.\n\n\"From the feedback I've had from members, a lot of them have difficulty \u2014 particularly very small, specialised units,\" she said.\n\n\"They have difficulty negotiating a reasonable indexation at the end of each contract.\"\n\nBupa said its main aim was a sustainable network across Australia.\n\n\"Bupa has an extensive private hospital network, and our relationships and commercial arrangements with hospital operators are both fair and equitable.\n\n\"Bupa is working closely with our hospital provider partners reach agreements that balance the needs of hospitals, while keeping health insurance affordable for our customers.\"\n\nThe company said it processed about six million hospital and medical claims each year and the overwhelming majority are assessed and paid without issue.",

        "text": "He got a quarter of the way there - registering his second-highest score in Test cricket - before throwing his hands at an Anderson Phillip delivery on a good length well outside his off stump. A seasoned opener might have recognised the danger in doing so. Trying to powerfully hit a ball on that line and length, given it had been nipping around in the morning, was always going to be fraught with danger. A freeze-frame of Konstas\u2019 caught behind dismissal off the bowling of Anderson Phillip. Credit: X Konstas, with confidence high after hitting a wristy cut/cover drive to the boundary a few minutes earlier, didn\u2019t move his front foot and edged behind, playing away from his body and with his head not in line. Shamar Joseph, who dismissed Konstas in both innings in the first Test, had only just finished his spell. Konstas had faced only two balls from Phillip, and it was evident he wanted to cash in.\n\nSince his remarkable Boxing Day innings against Jasprit Bumrah and India, Konstas has made Test scores of eight, 23, 22, three, five and 25 for a total of 86 runs at 14.33. It is probably a blessing for Konstas that his appearances at the crease in the Caribbean have been in the middle of the Australian night. He polarises opinion enough, let alone under the microscope of a home Australian summer when everyone is glued to their television. But the rusted-on tragics who stayed up until midnight to watch Konstas would have been buoyed when the 19-year-old plundered Shamar Joseph\u2019s first delivery of the Test to the deep square leg boundary. It was a crisp pull shot that showed real intent. Captain Pat Cummins said before the Test he wanted to see more of just that from a struggling top order.\n\nKonstas then looked to pinch singles and get off the strike. He had been encouraged by those close to him to take a more positive mindset into this match. At times, he did that, and is certainly a much better player when he is looking to score. The good players cash in when they make starts. Nearly half of Konstas\u2019 Test innings have been between 22 and 25. Sam Konstas was bowled for 25 in the second Test in Grenada. Credit: AP At the end of the day\u2019s play, Australian all-rounder Beau Webster praised Konstas for being more proactive than he was in his second innings in Barbados. \u201cI thought he looked back to his best today,\u201d Webster said after Australia were bowled out for 286. \u201cHe looked like he was really clear and positive in the way he wanted to score and keep out the good balls. Top-order bats are going to find the edge eventually \u2026 or the pad.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to find his feet.\u201d The performance still wasn\u2019t as fluent an innings as Konstas would like, though. On 10, he nearly chopped a ball onto his stumps from Seales and on 15, was put down by Roston Chase - although it would have been the catch of the century - high to his right at gully. For the third time in his seven Test digs, Konstas has perished in the 12th over of an innings. In the two other innings since his debut Test, he\u2019s been out in the fourth over. Australia\u2019s lack of opening batsmen options on this tour means Konstas will play the third Test in Kingston. He is only going to figure out Test cricket by being out in the middle, but it is imperative for him to get as much cricket as possible leading into the Ashes.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size New York: Celebrated historian Sir Niall Ferguson calls it \u201cFerguson\u2019s Law\u201d \u2013 a rule of thumb under which \u201cany great power that spends more on debt servicing than on defence risks ceasing to be a great power\u201d. In a February paper for the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, where he is a senior fellow, Ferguson explained that in 2024, for the first time in nearly a century, the United States spent a bigger share of gross domestic product paying interest on its debt (3.1 per cent) than it did on defence (3 per cent). And on present assumptions, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects net interest payments will account for nearly double the defence budget by 2050. President Donald Trump capped an extraordinary two weeks by winning Congressional passage of his \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d, which he will sign on Independence Day. Credit: AP \u201cThis unpleasant fiscal arithmetic poses a clear and present danger not merely to the US economy, but also to the position of the United States as the world\u2019s dominant military power,\u201d Ferguson says. \u201cIt must be a matter of urgent concern for American policymakers to restore an appropriate relationship between spending on debt service and spending on national security.\u201d Enter Donald Trump and his One Big Beautiful Bill. A grab bag of Trump\u2019s policy priorities, the bill bounced its way through Congress this week to arrive at the president\u2019s desk for signing on Friday, Independence Day (Saturday AEST), in a highly symbolic display of his sway over the Republican Party and indeed the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt caps an extraordinary two weeks in which Trump bombed Iran, dominated a NATO summit, shepherded a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, won a significant and highly consequential victory in the US Supreme Court, opened a detention centre nicknamed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d and, now, will ink his signature piece of legislation. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which is its official title, has at its centre the permanent extension of Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts for individuals and businesses, which were due to expire at the end of this year. According to the nonpartisan CBO, those tax cuts contribute the lion\u2019s share to a total increase in the budget deficit of $US3.25 trillion ($4.95 trillion) over the next 10 years \u2013 $US3.94 trillion including interest. The libertarian Cato Institute think tank, which advocates limited government, said that under what it called \u201crealistic assumptions\u201d about economic growth, extensions of tax giveaways or delays to spending reform, the bill could actually add more than $US6 trillion to the national debt. Big, beautiful, bonkers? \u201cThe debt burdens in this bill are unwelcome and dangerous,\u201d says Judge Block, a senior fellow at the New York-based Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the more expensive pieces of legislation in modern memory.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump administration, and many Republicans, see it differently. In their view, the bill actually reduces debt as it contains savings measures while mostly rolling over existing tax policy. Otherwise, Americans would be hit with an enormous tax increase. The CBO, on the other hand, bases its calculations off existing law, under which taxes revert to their pre-2017 levels. Block said Republicans could largely justify the 2017 Trump tax cuts because they were paired with significant simplifications of the tax code. That is not the case this time, he said, though there were positive aspects to the OBBB, such as immediate tax write-offs for research and development. \u201cTo a large extent, most of the debt here is coming from giveaways such as the overtime credit, the tax on tips deduction,\u201d he said. \u201cThose can\u2019t really be justified as tax simplification or a means toward economic growth, which makes their deficit-increasing aspect all the more worrying.\u201d House Republicans join Speaker Mike Johnson to celebrate signing Trump\u2019s bill. Credit: AP Introducing tax deductions for tips and overtime was a major Trump election promise, one he advertised with much fanfare in cities such as Las Vegas. There\u2019s a major catch, though: the policy expires at the end of 2028, when Trump leaves office. As Block points out, there are fairly substantial spending cuts in the bill, which Republicans have not always dared reach for in the past. The biggest is a record $US1 trillion cut to Medicaid, which provides health coverage for low-income adults and families. The CBO estimates this will lead to 11.8 million more people living without health insurance by 2034. The White House maintains there are no \u201ccuts\u201d to Medicaid in the OBBB. Rather, it says the savings come from removing illegal aliens from the program, enforcing work requirements and protecting Medicaid \u201cfor the truly vulnerable\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedicaid was a focus of a record-breaking speech by the Democrats\u2019 leader in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, who began before dawn on Thursday local time and spoke for nearly nine hours. Languishing without the numbers in either chamber of Congress, and with Trump stamping his authority on every aspect of American life, the listless Democratic Party was hoping to send a signal to angry voters, even if it was only able to delay the inevitable, with the OBBB passing quickly after Jeffries finally sat down. \u201c[Seventeen] million people just lost healthcare,\u201d posted the Democratic governor of California, Gavin Newsom, within minutes of the bill\u2019s passage. \u201c[Eighteen] million kids just lost school meals. Three million Americans just lost food assistance. And $US3.5 trillion was added to the deficit. All for a tax cut for Trump\u2019s billionaire donors.\u201d Newsom called it \u201cthe ultimate betrayal\u201d. American debt interest payments now exceed money spent on defence. Credit: AP In New York, young hedge fund manager Spencer Hakimian was also aghast. The 26-year-old, who has built an online following of 150,000 criticising Trump over tariffs, said history had shown debt accumulation is the ruin of empires. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep adding debt with no limit. Both parties are wrong about this, it\u2019s a complete fallacy,\u201d he said. And it was facetious for the administration to argue that the tax cuts didn\u2019t really contribute to debt, Hakimian said. The bill lifts the debt ceiling by another $US5 trillion. \u201cWhy would they be raising the debt limit if they weren\u2019t adding to the debt?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe feeling on Wall Street is mixed, Hakimian says, but most people are agnostic. Markets are already at all-time highs, with the US economy defying expectations, unemployment staying low and Trump\u2019s tariff threats largely petering out. That matches the assessment of The Economist\u2019s British editor-in-chief Zanny Minton Beddoes, who said the mood among New York financiers at the Aspen Ideas Festival was insouciant, and ambivalent about the debt. \u201cCall me a European grinch, but I felt I had arrived on planet Pangloss,\u201d she told subscribers in a note after the \u201cbig, beautiful, bonkers\u201d bill passed. \u201cI worry that Trumponomics 2.0 is eroding the foundations of America\u2019s economy in more fundamental ways than many people are willing to admit.\u201d A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Credit: AP Ticking time bomb Steven Hamilton, an Australian assistant professor of economics at George Washington University, says the debate over how to measure the One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019s impact on debt is moot. The point, he says, is that it presumes current policy can go on forever, and \u201cletting current policy go on forever is nuts\u201d. \u201cWithin 10 years, US debt to GDP will be approaching 130 per cent, which is well above any time in US history, well above World War II and beyond the level anyone really thinks is sustainable,\u201d Hamilton says.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Ricky Stuart, coach of NRL ladder leaders, Canberra, doesn\u2019t so much win games as avenge wrongs, overcome adversity and triumph over entrenched injustice. While siege mentality is embedded in his DNA, there is some justification for his conviction his club is perpetually under attack. The brand, Raiders, is a misnomer. They are the raided. I spoke to Stuart the day he learned his recruitment officer, Joel Carbone, had been poached by the Sydney Roosters. Carbone has been publicly lauded by Stuart for the recruitment of highly talented five-eighth Ethan Strange and a couple of other promising players yet to play NRL. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard losing players,\u201d Stuart says, admitting that after local junior Jack Wighton announced his exit in April 2023, he vowed to resign at the end of that season if Canberra failed to make the semis. The club came eighth. Jack Wighton jumped from Canberra to the Rabbitohs\u2019 carrot. Credit: John Shakespeare \u201cIt wears you down losing players you\u2019ve developed and staff you\u2019ve promoted,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a successful club off the field but we don\u2019t have billionaires. We are the raided, as you say.\u201d His nickname is Sticky, a derivative of the reversal, by a house mate, of the first letter of his names: Sticky Ruart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid but it stuck,\u201d he says. It\u2019s also accidental nominative determinism because Stuart is a charter member of the pick and stick club. Rickyland is his domain. He staked out its borders long ago: a narrow ridge of volcanic land with outsiders either side. It\u2019s a place where you trust almost no-one from outside the territory but like to be seen as completely trustworthy yourself. It\u2019s a region where he proclaims no-one\u2019s dignity is at risk but foolish errors are punished for only the fool\u2019s eyes to see. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a guy to coach for his players and there have been a number of times where I\u2019ve had to stick by the player but let the player know he\u2019s done the wrong thing privately,\u201d he says, conjuring up images of a guilty player standing in front of Stuart, as children do when telling their father they have wrecked the family car. \u201cPublicly, I protect him, put my arm around him but privately I tell him what was wrong. I\u2019ve always wanted to be that type of coach.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, if an outsider, such as a journalist, challenges one of his players, you measure Ricky\u2019s blast in megatonnes. For example, when Stuart coached the Roosters to the 2004 grand final and I questioned the effort level of winger Chris Walker ahead of the game, he went on TV suggesting I should address my own \u201cpersonal problems.\u201d After a careful self-examination of my possible private demons, I did cut back on the schooners. But only that particular evening. Ricky Stuart and Chris Walker face the media in 2003. Credit: Getty Images AsiaPac And it wasn\u2019t long before I was invited onto Rickyland to join his NSW team in the Origin series in 2005. There are those permanently banished from Rickyland, such as Penrith\u2019s Jaeman Salmon whom he called a \u201cweak-gutted dog\u201d and was fined by the NRL. Nick Politis was his chairman when Stuart coached the Roosters to the 2002 title at age 37. Politis\u2019s support extended to paying his fines for criticism of referees. Former NRL chief executive David Gallop recalls, \u201cI fined Ricky and a cheque landed on my desk the following day, a personal one signed by N G Politis, who clearly approved of his comments.\u201d However, Ricky\u2019s comment above about \u201cbillionaires\u201d suggests Politis is no longer a paid up member of Rickyland, with the poaching of Carbone affirming this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Stuart was the Bulldog\u2019s waterboy while recovering from a knee injury, he refused to give one senior forward a drink. \u201cI don\u2019t remember those days,\u201d he says with a knowing chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of some of the things I\u2019ve said. I know I\u2019m volatile but it\u2019s a volatile game. I stick up for what I think is right.\u201d The TV cameras have a close view of Stuart on game day because he is the only NRL coach who positions himself on the sideline. When I raised the possibility of his gaining a tactical advantage insofar as his volcanic presence intimidated referees and touch judges, a prolonged pause suggested I was about to be banished from Rickyland. \u201cThat\u2019s a load of shit,\u201d he finally said. \u201cLaughable.\u201d But a Storm player claims he copped a Ricky barb within the hearing of the referee and touch judge in the emotion charged final Magic Round match in Brisbane when the Storm took a seven-point lead late in the game, only for the referee to sight a Melbourne breach in a tackle and cancel the field goal. Ricky Stuart celebrates with Brad Fittler after winning a title in 2002. Credit: Craig Golding Later in our interview, Ricky returns to the sideline question, saying, \u201cI hate the cameras on the sideline but it\u2019s where I feel I coach the best. My three coaches \u2013 Tim (Sheens), Bozo (Bob Fulton) and Gus (Gould) - all coached from the sideline. I get the feeling of what the players are going through. I can\u2019t get that in a sterile coach\u2019s box. \u201cI like to see the energy and emotion of the player when he comes on and off the field. I like that feel between a coach desperate to win and his players\n\nwanting the same.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe swallows losses as if they were castor oil and would rather chew on balls of alfoil than praise a rival coach he does not like. When a delegation of his players tactfully pointed out Ricky\u2019s negativity following a loss risked becoming contagious, particularly with NRL short turnarounds, he volunteered to disappear. \u201cI had to have a good look at myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have a beer with my mates and sour the company. So I distanced myself.\u201d He is an old school coach, in this respect. Studying the demeanour of many mentors post match, it\u2019s difficult to know whether their team won, or lost. Again Stuart makes no apology for how he feels, pointing out that being comfortable after a loss will guarantee more losses. \u201cBeing sour after losing, is not something I practise,\u201d he says, perhaps tired of having to shadow box his reputation. Stuart has a beer with former Raider teammate and now-Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy after games between their two clubs. He even has a photo on his desk of the pair looking very inebriated in their playing days. But when the Raiders were challenging the Storm for semi-final places 2018-19, Melbourne assistants pointed to stories in a Sydney newspaper highlighting illegal wrestling tactics at Bellamy\u2019s club. Was this Stuart\u2019s super competitiveness in seeding stories, as many top coaches such as Jack Gibson and Fulton, did? Or a journalist seeking to ingratiate himself with the Canberra coach? Still a loyal teammate Bellamy isolated himself from the discussion.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Share\n\nSushi Room is complete. What\u2019s now often regarded as Brisbane\u2019s best sushi restaurant may have opened in 2021, but not to owner Simon Gloftis\u2019 original specs. The wrinkle? An existing ground-floor tenant on the Doggett Street side of The Calile. Sushi Room beneath The Calile has reopened with a new bar and dining section and entrance. Markus Ravik It meant a rework, with the intended street-side entrance relocated to a nondescript door just off The Calile lobby. It gave Sushi Room a low-key, hidden vibe, but Gloftis was never entirely happy with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI always felt it needed a sense of arrival, a place like Sushi Room,\u201d Gloftis says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very special room, a really special environment \u2026 walking in off The Lobby Bar was OK, but it didn\u2019t feel like you\u2019d arrived anywhere. It felt a bit too easy.\u201d Related Article Expect queues out the door at this hot new King Street patisserie As of late May, though, Sushi Room is a restaurant transformed. The Doggett Street tenant is gone, the former shopfront transformed into a new bar and al fresco dining area that, yes, also acts as the restaurant\u2019s entrance. In charge of the fit-out was regular Gloftis designers Richards & Spence. Compared with the soft moodiness of the restaurant dining room, the Brisbane-based firm has leant the new space a bolder, more approachable design that suits its street-side location, with upholstered booths, a striking marble bar and a mirrored ceiling installation. Outside, brushed-steel furniture lines the sidewalk, while inside a noren curtain leads the way to the original restaurant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA noren curtain separates the new bar and dining area from the original restaurant. Markus Ravik The new space is designed to be versatile \u2014 diners can use it to start or finish the night, or dine there a la carte \u2014 and gives the restaurant more scope to handle walk-ins. \u201cWhen you walk in there now, there\u2019s that sense of arrival,\u201d Gloftis says. \u201cYou go into the bar, through the noren curtain and into the dining room proper, and it\u2019s oriented the right way. You walk in and all the sushi chefs are standing in front of you. \u201cThe restaurant deserved that treatment. I couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d The new dining area features a terrazzo bar, mirrored features and banquette seating. Markus Ravik\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe central dining room remains much the same: there\u2019s still the 9.3-metre imported enoki dining counter, and still the bright-red private dining room upstairs. The menu remains much the same, and continues to leverage Gloftis\u2019 deep connections with local suppliers and fishers: there\u2019s alfonsino, fatty tuna and vinegared mackerel nigiri; mud crab and tempura prawn hand rolls; and toothfish and Kagoshima A5 rib eye cooked on the hibachi. Guests can order either a la carte or choose a $330 omakase experience. Sushi Room\u2019s central dining room remains much the same, and retains its signature 9.3-metre imported enoki dining counter. Markus Ravik \u201cWe\u2019ve had some time off so we\u2019ve improved a couple of little things,\u201d Gloftis says. \u201cWe\u2019ve added a beautiful little wakame salad and a couple of other little raw dishes that are really nice, but the bulk of the menu is 90 per cent the same.\u201d Gloftis likes to talk of a meal at Sushi Room as a journey, and reckons the updated restaurant completes that journey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt does,\u201d he says. \u201cThe way the restaurant is set out now, people say, \u2018It\u2019s totally changed.\u2019 And they look around and you go, \u2018No, actually it hasn\u2019t.\u2019 It\u2019s just that you\u2019ve walked in a different door. You\u2019re facing the right way.

        "text": "The spokesperson said Heritage was working closely with LGS to ensure the approved conservation works were completed as quickly as possible. This would include the roof, gutters, downpipes and reconstruction of the former chimneys. But Heritage was unaware that all work on the site had been stopped since August 2023, after a stop-work order was issued by the City of Sydney, which has delegated authority on all heritage properties in its local government area. This was issued, the council said, after the owner started work on a verandah awning without consent. Once a construction certificate is issued, the stop-work order will be lifted and works can continue under the approved DA. A spokesperson said: \u201cCouncil does all it can within its powers to conserve and protect heritage items\u201d.\n\nOn the Cleveland House website, Vincent said the stop-work order came after a member of the public complained. He said it had prevented \u201curgent and necessary repairs to the roof and exposes the building to potential damages being wrought from the increased weather elements being experienced in our time\u201d. This saga is typical of negotiations between Vincent, who bought the property in 1988, the City and Heritage NSW over the past 15 years. A stop-work order was issued on Cleveland House in Surry Hills in August 2023. Credit: Nick Moir LGS has received two NSW heritage grants for conservation works, the first in 2011-13 and, more recently, a $30,000 heritage grant in the 2023-25 round. Vincent was granted an extension to complete the works funded by the grants because he had obtained the required heritage and construction approvals.\n\nVincent has criticised delays in getting approval on his website and Facebook page. They detail how some applications for remedial work were rejected by Heritage NSW and how other development approvals were also rejected by council. Last October, his website celebrated a win in his bid to build a new toilet block, saying: \u201cFinally, after four years of communications it appears that the outstanding GTAs [General Terms of Approval] relating to the construction of the new toilet block may have been resolved\u201d. Loading Five development applications by LGS Enterprises for works totalling more than $500,000 have been approved by the City of Sydney since 2014. More were lodged before that. Some have timed out because they are older than five years. Other works got the go-ahead from the Heritage Council in 2011. The approvals provide for improvements to the commercial parts of the building, previously used by a publishing company, a new period fence, changes to windows, doors and the verandah. Other approvals relate to heritage materials.\n\nWhen it was listed by the National Trust in 1973, the home was described as an excellent example of colonial Georgian domestic architecture. It had two \u201ccurious entrance doors\u201d, a \u201csplendid exterior staircase\u201d, fan-lighted doors, and it was \u201crich in cedar joinery\u201d. Vincent has repeatedly updated the house\u2019s Facebook page to announce that restoration works would begin imminently, only for those works to stop. The Herald has been asking the owner to comment on the property\u2019s progress since 2022. Vincent has declined to answer, other than saying he could reveal more in \u201csix months\u201d. He often says \u201csensitive negotiations\u201d are continuing. A Friends of Cleveland House Facebook update said, \u201cThe reasons for the slow movements on the restoration of this building are entirely due to the ridiculous heritage and Sydney councils with whom we have been fighting for more than 10 years. We have now obtained (after much headache) approvals for most of what we are planning to restore this beautiful building, so I think you will see some substantial improvements throughout 2024.\u201d In early 2022, an update on the group\u2019s Facebook page said works would be completed in \u201cmid to late 2023\u201d.\n\nLoading In mid-2021, COVID lockdowns were blamed for delays, with a promise that work would continue \u201cwhen things open again\u201d. This week, he said it was a \u201cdelicate period\u201d and he didn\u2019t want to \u201center into discussion which may affect the progress forward\u201d. Delays are common in historic properties. These can include unexpected finds \u2013 a house in Bellevue Hill found unexploded ordnances, and a major institution discovered its old building didn\u2019t have footings. The planning and approval process is complicated, and work requires specialised trades and is expensive. Locals now hope for a breakthrough. \u201cEveryone is over it,\u201d said a neighbour, declining to be named. \u201cAnd they realise what a beautiful home it was and how important it is historically, but there doesn\u2019t ever seem to be any progress.\u201d",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Arriving in camp Maroon fresh off celebrating the birth of his son, Josh Papalii admits he remains uncertain of what lies beyond 2025. The veteran enforcer is eager to play on, yet it appears all but certain it will not be for his beloved Canberra Raiders. It has led to suggestions he could embark for a stint in England, but what he did confirm was this would be his final Queensland hurrah. \u201cOvertaking Jason Croker down there with the most games for Canberra Raiders is very special, and that\u2019s how I want to keep it,\u201d Papalii said. \u201cBut if the team that you\u2019re playing for is not offering you another contract, and you want to play on, you\u2019ve obviously got to look elsewhere. \u201cI\u2019m still unsure, I feel like I still got a lot to offer as a player and as a mentor and just being an older head. \u201cNever say never. I still feel like I\u2019ve got a lot of footy in me, whether that\u2019s in the NRL or Super League.\u201d Josh Papalii\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when Maroons coach Billy Slater dialled his number, there was no uncertainty around Papalii\u2019s decision to end his State of Origin hiatus, having retired from representative rugby league on the eve of the 2023 series. \u201cI missed the first couple of calls because my little fella and my wife were still in hospital at the time and there were a few complications with my little one,\u201d Papalii revealed. Loading \u201cI spoke to Bill when I had that little break, and he asked me one question and said if I had one more game in me. I replied with an \u2018F Bomb\u2019 and said yes, I had one more left. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely my last \u2026 I\u2019m still buzzing just being back in Maroon.\u201d Papalii enters Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast camp with an aura the rest of an under siege forward pack is eager to feed off. Despite forcing a decider, the Maroons engine room has been unable to dominate their New South Wales rivals \u2013 spearheaded by Broncos\u2019 superstar Payne Haas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose south of the border questioned why Queensland brought a 33-year-old out of the wilderness to match them up front, given he has not experienced the game\u2019s most daunting furnace for three years. According to fellow Maroons prop Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui, the doubters could not be more wrong, but they would have to wait for the reason to be revealed. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to wait until Wednesday, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to say. They can say whatever they want, but we know what Paps brings to this team, and they obviously don\u2019t know that,\u201d Fa\u2019asuamaleaui said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my idols, he\u2019s in my top five players that I\u2019ve ever played with, if not number one. He just brings that confidence for the whole group. \u201cHis aura, he\u2019s a gentle giant, and he loves a laugh, and he just brings everyone together. The aura he has just gives us confidence to do our role, and we just get behind it.\u201d The numbers across the opening two 2025 encounters is telling for the influence and physicality Papalii can inflict in the decider in Sydney.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Blues have run for more post-contact metres (1091 to 856) and tackle busts (80 to 52), while even in their Perth victory Queensland were kept to less than 30 metres per set on average. Even Fa\u2019asuamleaui has been below his best \u2013 his 90 running metres a game a complete contrast to 151 he has produced for the Gold Coast. Loading Papalii\u2019s SOS led to the axing of Moeaki Fotuaika, who after copping the brunt of criticism in game one \u2013 running for 38 metres from four carries \u2013 produced a far more emphatic 23-minute stint. \u201cI think everyone sees the errors that myself and he\u2019s made and think that\u2019s our whole performance,\u201d Fa\u2019asuamaleaui said. \u201cBut it\u2019s much bigger than that. Our teammates, our coaching staff, know what we bring. I thought Moe\u2019s been very good, and he was unlucky to miss out on this camp, but he\u2019ll be rooting for us.\u201d Even 321 NRL and 23 Origin games into his career, Papalii has found a way to remain the wrecking ball which made him a Raiders and Maroons legend \u2013 with approximately 40 per cent of his total metres this season post-contact.\n\nAdvertisement",

Source: AAP / House of Commons/UK Parliament Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has cried in public several times. Julia Gillard teared up during the launch of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) and Kevin Rudd cried when resigning from parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nBob Hawke, Malcolm Fraser and Malcolm Turnbull have also all cried on the job.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in 2025, we still seem unsure how to feel about tears, especially if they're at work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's still an outdated expectation that leaders must be strong \u2014 and that strong means unemotional,\" psychologist Carly Dober told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But crying is one of the body's strongest ways of self-soothing. It's neutral. It helps us recalibrate.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Feeling depleted by work? This is how Melanie beat burnout without quitting her job\n\nThe taboo of tears\n\nDespite how common it is, crying at work still carries a stigma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It tends to be seen as a taboo thing to do, but it is quite common,\" says UTS associate professor Robyn Johns, who specialises in human resources, industrial relations and occupational stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It often happens when people feel powerless, stressed, frustrated or in conflict at work.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDober agrees \u2014 and says suppressing those emotional reactions comes at a cost.\n\n\n\n\"Emotional suppression is really taxing on us and quite harmful,\" she says. \"We're not machines. We are emotional and social individuals.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says crying isn't a breakdown, but rather a biologically useful tool for emotional regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When we cry, amazing chemicals are released \u2026 endorphins that help us emotionally recalibrate.\"\n\n\n\nDoes crying at work damage your reputation? That depends\n\nBoth experts say the way tears are received at work depends heavily on the context, including your industry, workplace culture, job title, and even your gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whether it's accepted really depends on the workplace and what the norms are within that environment or profession,\" Johns says.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fields that require emotional labour \u2014 like teaching, social work or nursing \u2014 crying is more likely to be understood as part of burnout or compassion fatigue.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Fewer Australian women are working part-time. These are the jobs they want instead\n\n\"Burnout often includes emotional exhaustion, and in those professions, we do see crying more frequently as part of that process,\" Johns says.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, crying in high-pressure, white-collar workplaces can be seen as a big no-no.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It might be seen as a sign of weakness and impact your image in a negative way,\" she says.\n\n\n\nThe gender gap\n\nBoth experts say reactions to crying at work are still shaped by outdated \u2014 and deeply gendered \u2014 assumptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Typically, what we've seen within the gender power dynamics is that women are seen to be weak when they're crying,\" Johns says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Men are perceived to be more genuine or courageous or stronger or authentic in being able to display their emotions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whereas a lot of research sees that women are interpreted to be losing control or that they don't have the same emotional intelligence to be able to hold those more senior level roles \u2026 it can be quite damaging to their careers.\"\n\n\n\n\"Women can use their brains and they can self-soothe by crying,\" Dober added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One doesn't cancel the other out.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJohns suggests shifting focus away from gender and back to the circumstances of workplace crying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ask instead: what are the triggers \u2014 regardless of gender \u2014 that have brought somebody to this state?\"\n\n\n\nMaking space for emotion at work\n\nDespite the lingering stigma, both experts say workplaces are starting to change \u2014 slowly.\n\n\n\n\n\nApproximately 80 per cent of Australia's top 500 companies have an employee assistance program (EAP) in place, which aims to support employee wellbeing and provide mental health support, according to NSW government data from 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut support, Johns says, also needs to be cultural, not just procedural.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we don't want is people who have these emotions to feel like they've absolutely got to bottle them up, otherwise it's going to be a detriment to them in their career,\" she said. \"Because that's also not healthy.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Teaching was my dream job but I was forced to quit\n\nDober says workplace leaders play a key role in shaping emotional norms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Culture starts at the top,\" she says. \"If you say it's okay to cry but penalise people when they do, that's not psychologically safe.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth agree it's time to stop treating crying as weakness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you see someone cry at work, check your bias,\" Dober says. \"Crying is neutral.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nArtistic duo Khaled Sabsabi and Michael Dagostino have been re-invited to represent Australia at the 2026 Venice Biennale - a prestigious event for artists from around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe about-face was triggered by an independent review of Creative Australia's original decision made in February - when they revoked the invite - hoping to avoid what it described as divisive debate.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move drew wide-spread condemnation from the arts community, many seeing it as limiting artistic freedoms and increasing censorship.\n\n\n\n\n\nPenelope Benton, Executive Director of the National Association for the Visual Arts, welcomes Creative Australia's decision to restore their invitation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Artistic freedom and independent decision making are fundamental to the role of a national arts body. And these principles need to be upheld, and I think this marks a turning point in reaffirming our commitment to those principles, and improving practices to ensure this never happens again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move to rescind the pair's invitation came days after the Coalition questioned why the pair was chosen in the first place, drawing attention to two of Khaled Sabsabi's pieces from nearly 20 years ago, neither of which were submitted to the Venice Biennale.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first a video and sound installation called 'You', depicting the late leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe other 'Thank you very much' - which includes a video of the September 11 attacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex Ryvchin, the co-Chief Executive Officer of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, says the works make him doubtful Mr Sabsabi is the right choice to represent Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not a matter of he shouldn't be allowed to paint in this way or create art in this way. It's the question of is this the best person to represent Australian art. We have such rich stocks of wonderfully talented artists in this country, the vast majority of whom have never honoured terrorists\u2019 leaders and terrorist events in this way.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Ms Benton says this doesn't recognise the critical perspective Mr Sabsabi is taking in these works.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's been a great deal of writing, critique, by art theorists, curators over a long period of time analysing these works and recognising them as commentary on propaganda and mass-media. They were never an endorsement of terrorism.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inquiry found Creative Australia exercised its judgment in accordance with its obligations outlined by federal law, and no single person was to blame, but that there were a series of missteps, assumptions and missed opportunities.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreative Australia's acting chair, Wesley Enoch, told ABC radio the organisation stands by their decision to reinstate the pair as Australia's representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want to apologise to them for the hurt they've gone through in this process and though we'll be stronger because of it, I know it's come at a personal cost, not just to them, but also to a whole range of people in the art community. I feel that we as Creative Australia need to help the whole sector learn some of these lessons going forward.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSara Mansour is a Lebanese Australian lawyer, artist, poet and co-founder of the Bankstown Poetry Slam. She tells SBS Arabic she is relieved by the decision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I am really elated. It\u2019s kind of reinstated my hope in the Australian private sector and creative Australia specifically. It\u2019s illustrated the importance of risk mitigation and risk management procedures. As an artist, I feel like my faith has been restored.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement the artist Khaled Sabsabi and curator Michael Dagostino said:\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australians have been warned to stay alert for \"ghost stores\" as shoppers who fall victim have few avenues for recourse.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least four such stores have been noted by the Australian consumer watchdog for misleading shoppers into buying low-quality items.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey often claim to be local Australian businesses that are closing down and selling off high-quality goods, when they are actually based overseas and sell poor-quality, drop-shipped clothes and footwear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This conduct preys on the empathy of consumers who have a genuine desire to support local businesses,\" Australian Competition and Consumer Commission deputy chair Catriona Lowe said.\n\n\n\nThe commission specifically issued public warning notices about everly-melbourne.com, willowandgrace-adelaide.com, sophie-claire.com and doublebayboutique.com.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the issue appears to be more widespread, with the watchdog receiving at least 360 reports about 60 online retailers since the start of 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany complaints alleged ghost stores were refusing to provide refunds, were offering only partial refunds, or were not responding to complaints at all.\n\n\n\n\n\nNormally, Australians could pursue their consumer rights and go to a local store.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut because so many of the shops operate overseas, the usual consumer guarantees would not apply, Consumer Action Law Centre legal director Stephen Nowicki said.\n\n\n\n\"There's very little you can do,\" he added.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe commission has urged consumers to contact their bank to see if they can reverse the charge or stop the transaction.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this can be done when Australians fall victim to scams, the situation with ghost stores is less clear because shoppers still receive a product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It becomes harder in these kinds of situations, compared to an outright scam, to know what is a genuine discount versus what someone is presenting as a discount but is something not worth what they are promoting it as,\" Mr Nowicki said.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there are some potential areas for reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nThough governments could not pass laws that would give consumers jurisdiction against an overseas business, they could try to block and prevent advertising in the first place.\n\n\n\nHow to spot a 'ghost store'\n\nOperators generally target Australians through social media ads on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. They make themselves appear local by closing and then rebranding under new names that use different Australian suburbs, towns or cities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe competition and consumer commission has written to Meta, which owns both platforms, and e-commerce giant Shopify, which can be used to host and operate ghost web stores. It has also tried to educate shoppers.\n\n\n\n\n\nGhost store domains often end with \".com\" and not \".com.au\", and many use AI-generated images.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey also generally do not provide a physical address or a means of contact beyond an email address, while their Privacy Policy or Terms of Service sometimes refers to international regulations rather than Australian laws.\n\n\n\n",

Once you start on the path it can be hard to get off,\" Court said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These calls don\u2019t have the hallmarks of a typical scam. The caller will seemingly have your best interests at heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Consumers should always ask questions about salespeople's connections to funds, particularly in circumstances where a particular fund appears in the pitch, as there may be a commission arrangement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you are unsure or are feeling pressured, just hang up.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "He got a quarter of the way there - registering his second-highest score in Test cricket - before throwing his hands at an Anderson Phillip delivery on a good length well outside his off stump. A seasoned opener might have recognised the danger in doing so. Trying to powerfully hit a ball on that line and length, given it had been nipping around in the morning, was always going to be fraught with danger. A freeze-frame of Konstas\u2019 caught behind dismissal off the bowling of Anderson Phillip. Credit: X Konstas, with confidence high after hitting a wristy cut/cover drive to the boundary a few minutes earlier, didn\u2019t move his front foot and edged behind, playing away from his body and with his head not in line. Shamar Joseph, who dismissed Konstas in both innings in the first Test, had only just finished his spell. Konstas had faced only two balls from Phillip, and it was evident he wanted to cash in.\n\nSince his remarkable Boxing Day innings against Jasprit Bumrah and India, Konstas has made Test scores of eight, 23, 22, three, five and 25 for a total of 86 runs at 14.33. It is probably a blessing for Konstas that his appearances at the crease in the Caribbean have been in the middle of the Australian night. He polarises opinion enough, let alone under the microscope of a home Australian summer when everyone is glued to their television. But the rusted-on tragics who stayed up until midnight to watch Konstas would have been buoyed when the 19-year-old plundered Shamar Joseph\u2019s first delivery of the Test to the deep square leg boundary. It was a crisp pull shot that showed real intent. Captain Pat Cummins said before the Test he wanted to see more of just that from a struggling top order.\n\nKonstas then looked to pinch singles and get off the strike. He had been encouraged by those close to him to take a more positive mindset into this match. At times, he did that, and is certainly a much better player when he is looking to score. The good players cash in when they make starts. Nearly half of Konstas\u2019 Test innings have been between 22 and 25. Sam Konstas was bowled for 25 in the second Test in Grenada. Credit: AP At the end of the day\u2019s play, Australian all-rounder Beau Webster praised Konstas for being more proactive than he was in his second innings in Barbados. \u201cI thought he looked back to his best today,\u201d Webster said after Australia were bowled out for 286. \u201cHe looked like he was really clear and positive in the way he wanted to score and keep out the good balls. Top-order bats are going to find the edge eventually \u2026 or the pad.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to find his feet.\u201d The performance still wasn\u2019t as fluent an innings as Konstas would like, though. On 10, he nearly chopped a ball onto his stumps from Seales and on 15, was put down by Roston Chase - although it would have been the catch of the century - high to his right at gully. For the third time in his seven Test digs, Konstas has perished in the 12th over of an innings. In the two other innings since his debut Test, he\u2019s been out in the fourth over. Australia\u2019s lack of opening batsmen options on this tour means Konstas will play the third Test in Kingston. He is only going to figure out Test cricket by being out in the middle, but it is imperative for him to get as much cricket as possible leading into the Ashes.",

In a February paper for the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, where he is a senior fellow, Ferguson explained that in 2024, for the first time in nearly a century, the United States spent a bigger share of gross domestic product paying interest on its debt (3.1 per cent) than it did on defence (3 per cent). And on present assumptions, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects net interest payments will account for nearly double the defence budget by 2050. President Donald Trump capped an extraordinary two weeks by winning Congressional passage of his \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d, which he will sign on Independence Day. Credit: AP \u201cThis unpleasant fiscal arithmetic poses a clear and present danger not merely to the US economy, but also to the position of the United States as the world\u2019s dominant military power,\u201d Ferguson says. \u201cIt must be a matter of urgent concern for American policymakers to restore an appropriate relationship between spending on debt service and spending on national security.\u201d Enter Donald Trump and his One Big Beautiful Bill. A grab bag of Trump\u2019s policy priorities, the bill bounced its way through Congress this week to arrive at the president\u2019s desk for signing on Friday, Independence Day (Saturday AEST), in a highly symbolic display of his sway over the Republican Party and indeed the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt caps an extraordinary two weeks in which Trump bombed Iran, dominated a NATO summit, shepherded a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, won a significant and highly consequential victory in the US Supreme Court, opened a detention centre nicknamed \u201cAlligator Alcatraz\u201d and, now, will ink his signature piece of legislation. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), which is its official title, has at its centre the permanent extension of Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts for individuals and businesses, which were due to expire at the end of this year. According to the nonpartisan CBO, those tax cuts contribute the lion\u2019s share to a total increase in the budget deficit of $US3.25 trillion ($4.95 trillion) over the next 10 years \u2013 $US3.94 trillion including interest. The libertarian Cato Institute think tank, which advocates limited government, said that under what it called \u201crealistic assumptions\u201d about economic growth, extensions of tax giveaways or delays to spending reform, the bill could actually add more than $US6 trillion to the national debt. Big, beautiful, bonkers? \u201cThe debt burdens in this bill are unwelcome and dangerous,\u201d says Judge Block, a senior fellow at the New York-based Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the more expensive pieces of legislation in modern memory.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Trump administration, and many Republicans, see it differently. In their view, the bill actually reduces debt as it contains savings measures while mostly rolling over existing tax policy. Otherwise, Americans would be hit with an enormous tax increase. The CBO, on the other hand, bases its calculations off existing law, under which taxes revert to their pre-2017 levels. Block said Republicans could largely justify the 2017 Trump tax cuts because they were paired with significant simplifications of the tax code. That is not the case this time, he said, though there were positive aspects to the OBBB, such as immediate tax write-offs for research and development. \u201cTo a large extent, most of the debt here is coming from giveaways such as the overtime credit, the tax on tips deduction,\u201d he said. \u201cThose can\u2019t really be justified as tax simplification or a means toward economic growth, which makes their deficit-increasing aspect all the more worrying.\u201d House Republicans join Speaker Mike Johnson to celebrate signing Trump\u2019s bill. Credit: AP Introducing tax deductions for tips and overtime was a major Trump election promise, one he advertised with much fanfare in cities such as Las Vegas. There\u2019s a major catch, though: the policy expires at the end of 2028, when Trump leaves office. As Block points out, there are fairly substantial spending cuts in the bill, which Republicans have not always dared reach for in the past. The biggest is a record $US1 trillion cut to Medicaid, which provides health coverage for low-income adults and families. The CBO estimates this will lead to 11.8 million more people living without health insurance by 2034. The White House maintains there are no \u201ccuts\u201d to Medicaid in the OBBB. Rather, it says the savings come from removing illegal aliens from the program, enforcing work requirements and protecting Medicaid \u201cfor the truly vulnerable\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedicaid was a focus of a record-breaking speech by the Democrats\u2019 leader in the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries, who began before dawn on Thursday local time and spoke for nearly nine hours. Languishing without the numbers in either chamber of Congress, and with Trump stamping his authority on every aspect of American life, the listless Democratic Party was hoping to send a signal to angry voters, even if it was only able to delay the inevitable, with the OBBB passing quickly after Jeffries finally sat down. \u201c[Seventeen] million people just lost healthcare,\u201d posted the Democratic governor of California, Gavin Newsom, within minutes of the bill\u2019s passage. \u201c[Eighteen] million kids just lost school meals. Three million Americans just lost food assistance. And $US3.5 trillion was added to the deficit. All for a tax cut for Trump\u2019s billionaire donors.\u201d Newsom called it \u201cthe ultimate betrayal\u201d. American debt interest payments now exceed money spent on defence. Credit: AP In New York, young hedge fund manager Spencer Hakimian was also aghast. The 26-year-old, who has built an online following of 150,000 criticising Trump over tariffs, said history had shown debt accumulation is the ruin of empires. \u201cYou can\u2019t keep adding debt with no limit. Both parties are wrong about this, it\u2019s a complete fallacy,\u201d he said. And it was facetious for the administration to argue that the tax cuts didn\u2019t really contribute to debt, Hakimian said. The bill lifts the debt ceiling by another $US5 trillion. \u201cWhy would they be raising the debt limit if they weren\u2019t adding to the debt?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe feeling on Wall Street is mixed, Hakimian says, but most people are agnostic. Markets are already at all-time highs, with the US economy defying expectations, unemployment staying low and Trump\u2019s tariff threats largely petering out. That matches the assessment of The Economist\u2019s British editor-in-chief Zanny Minton Beddoes, who said the mood among New York financiers at the Aspen Ideas Festival was insouciant, and ambivalent about the debt. \u201cCall me a European grinch, but I felt I had arrived on planet Pangloss,\u201d she told subscribers in a note after the \u201cbig, beautiful, bonkers\u201d bill passed. \u201cI worry that Trumponomics 2.0 is eroding the foundations of America\u2019s economy in more fundamental ways than many people are willing to admit.\u201d A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Credit: AP Ticking time bomb Steven Hamilton, an Australian assistant professor of economics at George Washington University, says the debate over how to measure the One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019s impact on debt is moot. The point, he says, is that it presumes current policy can go on forever, and \u201cletting current policy go on forever is nuts\u201d. \u201cWithin 10 years, US debt to GDP will be approaching 130 per cent, which is well above any time in US history, well above World War II and beyond the level anyone really thinks is sustainable,\u201d Hamilton says.\n\nAdvertisement",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Ricky Stuart, coach of NRL ladder leaders, Canberra, doesn\u2019t so much win games as avenge wrongs, overcome adversity and triumph over entrenched injustice. While siege mentality is embedded in his DNA, there is some justification for his conviction his club is perpetually under attack. The brand, Raiders, is a misnomer. They are the raided. I spoke to Stuart the day he learned his recruitment officer, Joel Carbone, had been poached by the Sydney Roosters. Carbone has been publicly lauded by Stuart for the recruitment of highly talented five-eighth Ethan Strange and a couple of other promising players yet to play NRL. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard losing players,\u201d Stuart says, admitting that after local junior Jack Wighton announced his exit in April 2023, he vowed to resign at the end of that season if Canberra failed to make the semis. The club came eighth. Jack Wighton jumped from Canberra to the Rabbitohs\u2019 carrot. Credit: John Shakespeare \u201cIt wears you down losing players you\u2019ve developed and staff you\u2019ve promoted,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are a successful club off the field but we don\u2019t have billionaires. We are the raided, as you say.\u201d His nickname is Sticky, a derivative of the reversal, by a house mate, of the first letter of his names: Sticky Ruart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s stupid but it stuck,\u201d he says. It\u2019s also accidental nominative determinism because Stuart is a charter member of the pick and stick club. Rickyland is his domain. He staked out its borders long ago: a narrow ridge of volcanic land with outsiders either side. It\u2019s a place where you trust almost no-one from outside the territory but like to be seen as completely trustworthy yourself. It\u2019s a region where he proclaims no-one\u2019s dignity is at risk but foolish errors are punished for only the fool\u2019s eyes to see. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a guy to coach for his players and there have been a number of times where I\u2019ve had to stick by the player but let the player know he\u2019s done the wrong thing privately,\u201d he says, conjuring up images of a guilty player standing in front of Stuart, as children do when telling their father they have wrecked the family car. \u201cPublicly, I protect him, put my arm around him but privately I tell him what was wrong. I\u2019ve always wanted to be that type of coach.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, if an outsider, such as a journalist, challenges one of his players, you measure Ricky\u2019s blast in megatonnes. For example, when Stuart coached the Roosters to the 2004 grand final and I questioned the effort level of winger Chris Walker ahead of the game, he went on TV suggesting I should address my own \u201cpersonal problems.\u201d After a careful self-examination of my possible private demons, I did cut back on the schooners. But only that particular evening. Ricky Stuart and Chris Walker face the media in 2003. Credit: Getty Images AsiaPac And it wasn\u2019t long before I was invited onto Rickyland to join his NSW team in the Origin series in 2005. There are those permanently banished from Rickyland, such as Penrith\u2019s Jaeman Salmon whom he called a \u201cweak-gutted dog\u201d and was fined by the NRL. Nick Politis was his chairman when Stuart coached the Roosters to the 2002 title at age 37. Politis\u2019s support extended to paying his fines for criticism of referees. Former NRL chief executive David Gallop recalls, \u201cI fined Ricky and a cheque landed on my desk the following day, a personal one signed by N G Politis, who clearly approved of his comments.\u201d However, Ricky\u2019s comment above about \u201cbillionaires\u201d suggests Politis is no longer a paid up member of Rickyland, with the poaching of Carbone affirming this.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen Stuart was the Bulldog\u2019s waterboy while recovering from a knee injury, he refused to give one senior forward a drink. \u201cI don\u2019t remember those days,\u201d he says with a knowing chuckle. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of some of the things I\u2019ve said. I know I\u2019m volatile but it\u2019s a volatile game. I stick up for what I think is right.\u201d The TV cameras have a close view of Stuart on game day because he is the only NRL coach who positions himself on the sideline. When I raised the possibility of his gaining a tactical advantage insofar as his volcanic presence intimidated referees and touch judges, a prolonged pause suggested I was about to be banished from Rickyland. \u201cThat\u2019s a load of shit,\u201d he finally said. \u201cLaughable.\u201d But a Storm player claims he copped a Ricky barb within the hearing of the referee and touch judge in the emotion charged final Magic Round match in Brisbane when the Storm took a seven-point lead late in the game, only for the referee to sight a Melbourne breach in a tackle and cancel the field goal. Ricky Stuart celebrates with Brad Fittler after winning a title in 2002. Credit: Craig Golding Later in our interview, Ricky returns to the sideline question, saying, \u201cI hate the cameras on the sideline but it\u2019s where I feel I coach the best. My three coaches \u2013 Tim (Sheens), Bozo (Bob Fulton) and Gus (Gould) - all coached from the sideline. I get the feeling of what the players are going through. I can\u2019t get that in a sterile coach\u2019s box. \u201cI like to see the energy and emotion of the player when he comes on and off the field. I like that feel between a coach desperate to win and his players\n\nwanting the same.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe swallows losses as if they were castor oil and would rather chew on balls of alfoil than praise a rival coach he does not like. When a delegation of his players tactfully pointed out Ricky\u2019s negativity following a loss risked becoming contagious, particularly with NRL short turnarounds, he volunteered to disappear. \u201cI had to have a good look at myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have a beer with my mates and sour the company. So I distanced myself.\u201d He is an old school coach, in this respect. Studying the demeanour of many mentors post match, it\u2019s difficult to know whether their team won, or lost. Again Stuart makes no apology for how he feels, pointing out that being comfortable after a loss will guarantee more losses. \u201cBeing sour after losing, is not something I practise,\u201d he says, perhaps tired of having to shadow box his reputation. Stuart has a beer with former Raider teammate and now-Melbourne coach Craig Bellamy after games between their two clubs. He even has a photo on his desk of the pair looking very inebriated in their playing days. But when the Raiders were challenging the Storm for semi-final places 2018-19, Melbourne assistants pointed to stories in a Sydney newspaper highlighting illegal wrestling tactics at Bellamy\u2019s club. Was this Stuart\u2019s super competitiveness in seeding stories, as many top coaches such as Jack Gibson and Fulton, did? Or a journalist seeking to ingratiate himself with the Canberra coach? Still a loyal teammate Bellamy isolated himself from the discussion.\n\nAdvertisement",

The wrinkle? An existing ground-floor tenant on the Doggett Street side of The Calile. Sushi Room beneath The Calile has reopened with a new bar and dining section and entrance. Markus Ravik It meant a rework, with the intended street-side entrance relocated to a nondescript door just off The Calile lobby. It gave Sushi Room a low-key, hidden vibe, but Gloftis was never entirely happy with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI always felt it needed a sense of arrival, a place like Sushi Room,\u201d Gloftis says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very special room, a really special environment \u2026 walking in off The Lobby Bar was OK, but it didn\u2019t feel like you\u2019d arrived anywhere. It felt a bit too easy.\u201d Related Article Expect queues out the door at this hot new King Street patisserie As of late May, though, Sushi Room is a restaurant transformed. The Doggett Street tenant is gone, the former shopfront transformed into a new bar and al fresco dining area that, yes, also acts as the restaurant\u2019s entrance. In charge of the fit-out was regular Gloftis designers Richards & Spence. Compared with the soft moodiness of the restaurant dining room, the Brisbane-based firm has leant the new space a bolder, more approachable design that suits its street-side location, with upholstered booths, a striking marble bar and a mirrored ceiling installation. Outside, brushed-steel furniture lines the sidewalk, while inside a noren curtain leads the way to the original restaurant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA noren curtain separates the new bar and dining area from the original restaurant. Markus Ravik The new space is designed to be versatile \u2014 diners can use it to start or finish the night, or dine there a la carte \u2014 and gives the restaurant more scope to handle walk-ins. \u201cWhen you walk in there now, there\u2019s that sense of arrival,\u201d Gloftis says. \u201cYou go into the bar, through the noren curtain and into the dining room proper, and it\u2019s oriented the right way. You walk in and all the sushi chefs are standing in front of you. \u201cThe restaurant deserved that treatment. I couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201d The new dining area features a terrazzo bar, mirrored features and banquette seating. Markus Ravik\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe central dining room remains much the same: there\u2019s still the 9.3-metre imported enoki dining counter, and still the bright-red private dining room upstairs. The menu remains much the same, and continues to leverage Gloftis\u2019 deep connections with local suppliers and fishers: there\u2019s alfonsino, fatty tuna and vinegared mackerel nigiri; mud crab and tempura prawn hand rolls; and toothfish and Kagoshima A5 rib eye cooked on the hibachi. Guests can order either a la carte or choose a $330 omakase experience. Sushi Room\u2019s central dining room remains much the same, and retains its signature 9.3-metre imported enoki dining counter.

        "text": "The spokesperson said Heritage was working closely with LGS to ensure the approved conservation works were completed as quickly as possible. This would include the roof, gutters, downpipes and reconstruction of the former chimneys. But Heritage was unaware that all work on the site had been stopped since August 2023, after a stop-work order was issued by the City of Sydney, which has delegated authority on all heritage properties in its local government area. This was issued, the council said, after the owner started work on a verandah awning without consent. Once a construction certificate is issued, the stop-work order will be lifted and works can continue under the approved DA. A spokesperson said: \u201cCouncil does all it can within its powers to conserve and protect heritage items\u201d.\n\nOn the Cleveland House website, Vincent said the stop-work order came after a member of the public complained. He said it had prevented \u201curgent and necessary repairs to the roof and exposes the building to potential damages being wrought from the increased weather elements being experienced in our time\u201d. This saga is typical of negotiations between Vincent, who bought the property in 1988, the City and Heritage NSW over the past 15 years. A stop-work order was issued on Cleveland House in Surry Hills in August 2023. Credit: Nick Moir LGS has received two NSW heritage grants for conservation works, the first in 2011-13 and, more recently, a $30,000 heritage grant in the 2023-25 round. Vincent was granted an extension to complete the works funded by the grants because he had obtained the required heritage and construction approvals.\n\nVincent has criticised delays in getting approval on his website and Facebook page. They detail how some applications for remedial work were rejected by Heritage NSW and how other development approvals were also rejected by council. Last October, his website celebrated a win in his bid to build a new toilet block, saying: \u201cFinally, after four years of communications it appears that the outstanding GTAs [General Terms of Approval] relating to the construction of the new toilet block may have been resolved\u201d. Loading Five development applications by LGS Enterprises for works totalling more than $500,000 have been approved by the City of Sydney since 2014. More were lodged before that. Some have timed out because they are older than five years. Other works got the go-ahead from the Heritage Council in 2011. The approvals provide for improvements to the commercial parts of the building, previously used by a publishing company, a new period fence, changes to windows, doors and the verandah. Other approvals relate to heritage materials.\n\nWhen it was listed by the National Trust in 1973, the home was described as an excellent example of colonial Georgian domestic architecture. It had two \u201ccurious entrance doors\u201d, a \u201csplendid exterior staircase\u201d, fan-lighted doors, and it was \u201crich in cedar joinery\u201d. Vincent has repeatedly updated the house\u2019s Facebook page to announce that restoration works would begin imminently, only for those works to stop. The Herald has been asking the owner to comment on the property\u2019s progress since 2022. Vincent has declined to answer, other than saying he could reveal more in \u201csix months\u201d. He often says \u201csensitive negotiations\u201d are continuing. A Friends of Cleveland House Facebook update said, \u201cThe reasons for the slow movements on the restoration of this building are entirely due to the ridiculous heritage and Sydney councils with whom we have been fighting for more than 10 years. We have now obtained (after much headache) approvals for most of what we are planning to restore this beautiful building, so I think you will see some substantial improvements throughout 2024.\u201d In early 2022, an update on the group\u2019s Facebook page said works would be completed in \u201cmid to late 2023\u201d.\n\nLoading In mid-2021, COVID lockdowns were blamed for delays, with a promise that work would continue \u201cwhen things open again\u201d. This week, he said it was a \u201cdelicate period\u201d and he didn\u2019t want to \u201center into discussion which may affect the progress forward\u201d. Delays are common in historic properties. These can include unexpected finds \u2013 a house in Bellevue Hill found unexploded ordnances, and a major institution discovered its old building didn\u2019t have footings. The planning and approval process is complicated, and work requires specialised trades and is expensive. Locals now hope for a breakthrough. \u201cEveryone is over it,\u201d said a neighbour, declining to be named. \u201cAnd they realise what a beautiful home it was and how important it is historically, but there doesn\u2019t ever seem to be any progress.\u201d",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Arriving in camp Maroon fresh off celebrating the birth of his son, Josh Papalii admits he remains uncertain of what lies beyond 2025. The veteran enforcer is eager to play on, yet it appears all but certain it will not be for his beloved Canberra Raiders. It has led to suggestions he could embark for a stint in England, but what he did confirm was this would be his final Queensland hurrah. \u201cOvertaking Jason Croker down there with the most games for Canberra Raiders is very special, and that\u2019s how I want to keep it,\u201d Papalii said. \u201cBut if the team that you\u2019re playing for is not offering you another contract, and you want to play on, you\u2019ve obviously got to look elsewhere. \u201cI\u2019m still unsure, I feel like I still got a lot to offer as a player and as a mentor and just being an older head. \u201cNever say never. I still feel like I\u2019ve got a lot of footy in me, whether that\u2019s in the NRL or Super League.\u201d Josh Papalii\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut when Maroons coach Billy Slater dialled his number, there was no uncertainty around Papalii\u2019s decision to end his State of Origin hiatus, having retired from representative rugby league on the eve of the 2023 series. \u201cI missed the first couple of calls because my little fella and my wife were still in hospital at the time and there were a few complications with my little one,\u201d Papalii revealed. Loading \u201cI spoke to Bill when I had that little break, and he asked me one question and said if I had one more game in me. I replied with an \u2018F Bomb\u2019 and said yes, I had one more left. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely my last \u2026 I\u2019m still buzzing just being back in Maroon.\u201d Papalii enters Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast camp with an aura the rest of an under siege forward pack is eager to feed off. Despite forcing a decider, the Maroons engine room has been unable to dominate their New South Wales rivals \u2013 spearheaded by Broncos\u2019 superstar Payne Haas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose south of the border questioned why Queensland brought a 33-year-old out of the wilderness to match them up front, given he has not experienced the game\u2019s most daunting furnace for three years. According to fellow Maroons prop Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui, the doubters could not be more wrong, but they would have to wait for the reason to be revealed. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to wait until Wednesday, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got to say. They can say whatever they want, but we know what Paps brings to this team, and they obviously don\u2019t know that,\u201d Fa\u2019asuamaleaui said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my idols, he\u2019s in my top five players that I\u2019ve ever played with, if not number one. He just brings that confidence for the whole group. \u201cHis aura, he\u2019s a gentle giant, and he loves a laugh, and he just brings everyone together. The aura he has just gives us confidence to do our role, and we just get behind it.\u201d The numbers across the opening two 2025 encounters is telling for the influence and physicality Papalii can inflict in the decider in Sydney.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Blues have run for more post-contact metres (1091 to 856) and tackle busts (80 to 52), while even in their Perth victory Queensland were kept to less than 30 metres per set on average. Even Fa\u2019asuamleaui has been below his best \u2013 his 90 running metres a game a complete contrast to 151 he has produced for the Gold Coast. Loading Papalii\u2019s SOS led to the axing of Moeaki Fotuaika, who after copping the brunt of criticism in game one \u2013 running for 38 metres from four carries \u2013 produced a far more emphatic 23-minute stint. \u201cI think everyone sees the errors that myself and he\u2019s made and think that\u2019s our whole performance,\u201d Fa\u2019asuamaleaui said. \u201cBut it\u2019s much bigger than that. Our teammates, our coaching staff, know what we bring. I thought Moe\u2019s been very good, and he was unlucky to miss out on this camp, but he\u2019ll be rooting for us.\u201d Even 321 NRL and 23 Origin games into his career, Papalii has found a way to remain the wrecking ball which made him a Raiders and Maroons legend \u2013 with approximately 40 per cent of his total metres this season post-contact.\n\nAdvertisement",
