Earlier this year, he pulled a train. He has also singlehandedly pulled a locomotive and four years ago, a truck.\n\nMahrous in action whilst a Guinness Book of World Records official watches on. (AP)\n\nWith each achievement, his popularity has soared \u2014 children run after him in the streets, where he's known simply as \u201cstrong man.\u201d\n\nWith the ship pull, Mahrous, a 44-year-old native of the port city of Ismalia, hopes to get yet another recognition from the Guinness World Records.\n\nA triumph by the Red Sea\n\nThe scene was set at the shore in Hurghada. Mahrous first pulled a 700-ton ship, and to affirm his challenge he pulled two ships weighing approximately 1150 tons together.\n\n\u201cI pulled them both, thanks to God, to prove to my friends and the whole world that God blessed me by being the strongest man in the world,\u201d Mahrous said.\n\nHe said the current Guinness World Record is a 614-ton ship set in 2018.\n\nMahrous said he will send videos and photos of his attempt to Guinness World Records to be evaluated.\n\nMahrous celebrating his feat. (AP)\n\nIn preparation for the feat, Mahrous followed a protein- and iron-rich diet, consuming at least a dozen eggs, two whole chickens, and 5 kilograms of fish every day \u2014 all while training for two hours, three times a day.\n\nIt wasn't his first ship pull. Six years ago, he tried for two hours before he managed to pull a 4000-ton ship in the water, a rope strapped to his shoulders, for about 30 metres. The event was caught on video.\n\n\u2033I grunted and yelled as I pulled the ship, and I spoke to it, saying \u2018It\u2019s either me or you today,\u2019\" he told The Associated Press recently at his local gym in Cairo, where he trains daily.\n\nMahrous believes that speaking with the object he pulls beforehand helps him establish a connection and is key to his success. \u201cIt\u2019s important for me to treat the object that I will pull as part of my body that moves along with my heart beat,\u201d he said.\n\nAn extraordinary child\n\nMahrous, 190 centimetres tall and weighing 155 kilograms, said his strength emerged early.\n\nAs a child, he would carry his friends for fun and haul heavy loads, several gas cylinders at once on a wheelbarrow. He was nine when his father lost his job as a contractor in Iraq and after that, Mahrous began knocking on doors, offering to lift heavy items for some cash.\n\nOnce, he accidentally broke a friend\u2019s arm when he tried to pull him as they played. He helped people move bricks, sandbags and other heavy materials \u2014 and he was fast. He loved sports and trained in kung fu, kickboxing and even established a wrestling team in Cairo.\n\nIt was only when his friends saw him easily flip giant tires 10 times in a row in a deserted courtyard at their gym and push a car using only a finger that they encouraged him to go for a world record.\n\n\u201cI was inspired by people who broke records and felt like they are no better than me,\u201d he said. Now he's less fearful of injuries and more concerned about failing to accomplish a pull.\n\nMahrous was supported by a crowd of people on the shores of the Red Sea. (AP)\n\nPast recognitions\n\nIn March, he was formally recognised by Guinness World Records for the heaviest rail pull: He pulled a train weighing 279 tons with a rope held by his teeth for a distance of nearly 10 metres. At the time, he received two other certificates, for the heaviest locomotive pull and for the fastest 100-metre road vehicle pull.\n\nMahrous, who is also president of the Egyptian Federation for Professional Wrestlers, was previously recognised by Guinness in June 2021, for pulling a 15,730-kilogram truck with his teeth. And in February 2024, the international franchise recognised him for cracking and eating 11 raw eggs in 30 seconds.\n\nHe wears a mouthguard during pulling events but says he has no concerns about his teeth. Instead of going to a dentist, he uses a miswak \u2014 a traditional teeth-cleaning twig rich in anti-bacterial compounds that help prevent decay.\n\nHe says he takes no supplements but eats, sleeps and works out at least twice every day.\n\nHis ambitions are far from over. Next, he plans to send a request to the Egyptian presidency for permission to pull a 263,000-ton submarine.\n\nHe also hopes someday to pull a plane using only his eyelid muscles.",

(Supplied: KTM)\n\nMore silverware in Portugal\n\nFrom the outset, Sanders reminded his rivals why he was the runaway championship leader.\n\nOn his number-four pumpkin-orange dirt bike, the Australian was quickest on four days \u2014 cutting a blistering pace through dusty tracks which caught out two experienced rivals.\n\nRacers navigated unpredictable and evolving sand tracks, over rolling hills, bush and open plains \u2014 even briefly crossing into neighbouring Spain.\n\nFor Sanders, whose unshakable grin has symbolised just how much he's enjoyed 2025, there were once again no major issues.\n\nThe Australian crossed the finish line more than three minutes ahead of his closest rival, extending his record-breaking run.\n\n\"It's very rare to have this sort of consistency in rally,\" Sanders said.\n\n\"I'm happy to get the world championship here in Portugal and, hopefully, there's a lot more to come.\"\n\nDaniel Sanders rides through a dusty section of track in Portugal.

        "text": "Tadej Poga\u010dar has achieved another phenomenal and historic world road race championship triumph, defending his rainbow jersey in Rwanda with a now trademark epic solo ride.\n\nThe great Slovenian attacked with 104 kilometres left on Mount Kigali on Sunday, local time, and went it alone 66km from home to destroy the field and become the first man to complete the world championship-Tour de France double in successive years.\n\nWith a tour de force that again raises the question of whether he might just be the greatest cyclist of all time, Poga\u010dar had 1 minute 28 seconds to spare over Olympic champion Remco Evenepoel at the end of the 267.7km slog around Kigali, which featured a merciless 5,475m of climbing.\n\nEvenepoel added silver to the gold he had won in the time trial the previous weekend, and was left musing with frustration on how he might have gotten so much closer to Poga\u010dar if he hadn't lost crucial time because of two bike changes.\n\nIreland's Ben Healy took the bronze medal, 2:16 behind Poga\u010dar, to become the first Irishman on the podium since Sean Kelly in 1989.\n\nPoga\u010dar's victory was truly extraordinary on a day so tough that only 30 riders among the 165-strong field managed to complete the course in hot, stifling conditions, including two battling Australians \u2014 Jai Hindley, who was 16th at 10:01 behind Poga\u010dar, and Michael Storer, who was 19th at 10:12.\n\nPoga\u010dar broke Evenepoel and the rest of the field on the Mount Kigali ascent, taking only Spain's Juan Ayuso and Mexico's Isaac del Toro \u2014 his two teammates at UAE Team Emirates-XRG \u2014 with him, but not for long until he finally decided he must cast del Toro adrift.\n\n\"Juan had a problem quite soon, and Isaac had some stomach problems, and I was left alone quite early, but I'm so happy I made it,\" said Poga\u010dar, who'd won last year's race in Zurich with a similar assault but had flagged in the later stages.\n\nNot this year, though, even if he admitted: \"It was getting harder every lap, so the energy resources were running out near the end. You doubt a bit, but you have to push through and do your best.\"\n\nCheered on by thousands thronging the streets of Rwanda's capital in a ride befitting the first championships staged in Africa, Poga\u010dar, who made light of the cobbled climb 15 times on the city circuit, even had time to smile on the victory lap, hailing his 6 hours 20 minutes in the saddle as an \"extraordinary experience\".\n\nHindley was at one point looking strong in a five-man chase group headed by Evenepoel that raised hopes he might emulate Ben O'Connor, Australia's silver medallist last year.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nEventually, though, the relentless climbing took its toll, leaving even one all-time great Primo\u017e Rogli\u010d, who finished 11th, admitting if felt like \"torture\".\n\nOnly a week ago, Poga\u010dar's failure to finish among the medals in the time trial had raised questions about his readiness, but once again, the amazing 27-year-old had the perfect answer as he became the first rider since Juan Alaphilippe in 2020 and 2021 to successfully defend the title.\n\nIt capped another amazing year for Poga\u010dar, who claimed a fourth Tour de France crown in July, and added spring classics triumphs at Strade Bianche, the Tour of Flanders, La Fleche Wallonne and Liege\u2013Bastogne\u2013Liege.\n\nHe'll have another Monument in his sights at the Tour of Lombardy next month, with his illustrious Slovenian teammate Rogli\u010d left marvelling: \"He's incredible \u2014 chapeau to him.\"\n\nAAP",

(Supplied)\n\nAnita now works as a trauma counsellor and hasn't looked back.\n\n\"I'm in the best job of my life,\" she says.\n\nWhy volunteer\n\nIn Australia, an estimated 5 million people volunteer for various reasons.\n\nA survey of employers found that 85 per cent valued volunteering as work experience when hiring.\n\nVolunteering Australia CEO Mark Pearce says it can help build connections and help get a foot in the door in industries you may be new to.\n\n\" It provides the opportunity for people to develop skills, to build networks, to gain experience. \"\n\nVolunteering can include many different activities, such as working in kitchens. (ABC News: Rachael Lucas)\n\nRachel Hannam, a psychologist specialising in career counselling, says it can be a great way to get into a role, or get a better view of an industry or organisation.\n\n\"I've certainly sent clients to volunteering and they've found plenty of organisations which love having volunteers and it's often been a stepping stone for them, either psychologically or materially because they've ended up with paid work,\" she says.\n\n\"It's what we call a realistic job preview. So you give yourself a preview of what it might be like to work in a particular industry or organisation,\" Dr Hannam says.\n\nMr Pearce says it can be a beneficial stepping stone for a number of different industries.\n\n\"We've certainly seen it a lot in industries like health and aged care, things to do with environment and animal welfare and also with organisations and industries involved in things like disaster recovery preparedness and relief.\n\n\"People will often get involved with the SES, which does a remarkable job in communities, they love it, they build experience, they become conversant with the language of the organisation and the sector, and then they may well look to gain employment in that sector.\"\n\nAn SES volunteer helping out after ex-Tropical Cyclone Jasper tore through Cairns. ( ABC News: Michael Lloyd )\n\nVolunteering is not just free labour\n\nWhile valuable for experience, it's important to note that volunteering is not just free labour.\n\nVolunteering Australia notes that the definition of volunteering is, \"time willingly given for the common good and without financial gain.\"\n\n\"This is a really important definition,\" Mr Pearce says.\n\nVolunteering is distinct from unpaid internships or work experience.\n\nVolunteering shouldn\u2019t be a sacrifice, but an expression of belonging Australia can no longer afford to treat volunteering as a nostalgic value. It is a priority that must evolve with the society it\u2019s meant to serve. But guilt won\u2019t fix the current volunteer shortfall.\n\nMr Pearce says volunteering has positive impacts on community, and can include animal welfare, arts, heritage, business, unions, emergency services, health, religion, law and welfare.\n\n\"It's time willingly given for the common good. And this speaks for things like, for example, causes and others.\"\n\nDispersing the fantasy\n\nVolunteering can also help you understand how suitable an organisation is for you and how aligned it is with your values.\n\nSometimes, it can remove a misconception about a job.\n\nHas volunteering helped you with a career change or decision? Share with us here.\n\nDr Hannam says she's had clients who volunteered at an animal rescue and chose not to pursue it.\n\n\"It could have been other people, or it could have been the work was really not what they thought \u2014 [for example] It was monotonous and boring.\n\n\" Sometimes we have this idealised and fantasy idea of volunteering and working in this kind of an organisation, and so often in life, our fantasies are blown up by reality. \"\n\nDr Hannam herself had a \"fantasy\" of working as a school teacher.\n\n\"I remember I wanted to be a primary school teacher, had a fantasy of it, idealised the idea of being this awesome school teacher and I actually became a teacher \u2014 and it was a shock to the system of how different in reality it was to my fantasy,\" she says.\n\nSome people have volunteered with the SES and it has led to paid work. (Supplied: NSW SES )\n\nIf volunteering doesn't feel like an option\n\nVolunteering may not be suitable for a number of reasons. If you're time-poor, or the locations don't work, or the type of job you want to move into simply doesn't facilitate voluntary work.\n\nThe benefits of having a mundane job Photo shows woman laying on table looking bored at work Meg has never had a \"dream job\" and says mundane works brings her financial security, peace, and flexibility.\n\nDr Hannam says there are still ways you can get a feel for an industry.\n\n\"Go talk to people,\" she says, recommending people connect with industry insiders, get to know the ins and outs, the frustrations of the job and read job descriptions.\n\nSocial media can be a helpful way to do this.\n\nMr Pearce makes the point that volunteering doesn't have to be a large time commitment.\n\n\"As the name suggests, it's voluntary. We're seeing that, because people are far more time-poor, community expectations have changed quite a bit. People are becoming more willing to say: 'I only have 2 hours in a week or maybe 1 hour every fortnight, but I really want to contribute.'\"\n\nAdd to your watchlist Photo shows Mystery Road Origin ABC iview with young detective Jay Swan in the bush. The critically acclaimed Mystery Road: Origin returns as Detective Jay Swan (Mark Coles Smith) and Mary (Tuuli Narkle) uncover dark secrets in a haunted timber town, where the past threatens to tear them apart.\n\nAnd if you do sign up to a volunteering position and feel it's not for you, there's no obligation to continue.\n\n\"There's no employment contract. So as a consequence of that, people can volunteer as and when it suits them,\" says Mr Pearce.\n\nAnd whether it's the right fit or not, no decision is \"wrong\", says Dr Hannam.\n\n\" We have to just remember that no decision is wrong. In the end, being a teacher led me back to psychology and different decisions will lead you somewhere and no path is right or wrong. \"",

        "text": "A premiership isn't supposed to be perfect, and that's the entire point for both Melbourne and Brisbane ahead of Sunday's NRL grand final.\n\nThe two teams approach the decider from opposite directions. The Storm aspire to perfection, and under Craig Bellamy, they always have.\n\nThere must be some part of them that knows they can never get there, but as they gear up for their 11th grand final under their legendary mentor, they also know the chase of it is a trick they play on themselves.\n\nThe pursuit of that perfection is what has made Melbourne strong, fast, and smart, and why it knows exactly what percentages to play and how to play them.\n\nThe Storm continues to be a force despite years of being consistently being in contention. (AAP: Joel Carrett)\n\nIt's what has made the Storm the team of the new century for so long that the century isn't all that new anymore.\n\nBut it's also a lie that drives them towards a higher truth and the foundation on which the real winning is done, as proven by their preliminary final win over Cronulla.\n\nA perfect team would not play Jahrome Hughes with an arm held together by prayers and good intentions, and a perfect team would not trust him to play his normal game in such a big spot, or score a 30-metre solo try right through the heart of the Sharks' defence, because a perfect team cannot trust to something as human as courage.\n\nA perfect team would not have Cameron Munster dink a little kick over the top for Ryan Papenhuyzen from the middle of the field, in an attacking position with tackles up their sleeve, because the percentages say to just tighten the grip.\n\nNor would they want Harry Grant to run it from dummy half on his own side of halfway on the last with eight points in the game and five minutes on the clock, because a perfect team could not allow instinct or feeling or spirit into its operating system.\n\nWhen Melbourne threw perfection away on Friday night, it found tries because, to a man, the Storm has all the benefits of a classic football education while knowing that sometimes a masterpiece has to go outside the lines.\n\nBrisbane, by contrast, lives so far outside the lines it can't even see them. They could never be perfect because they are too wild, too emotional, too caught in the rapture of the big moments and victories they crave so badly.\n\nThat's why they fell behind by 18 points against Canberra in week one, and 14 points against Penrith, and it's also why they were able to win both times and move to the brink of a premiership.\n\nIt's not that coach Michael Maguire makes them that way. After all, he came up under Bellamy at the Storm, and you could fill tomes with what's been written about the work ethic he demands of his players and himself.\n\nHe has put the steel into them, and helped them find a rare resilience, but nobody could build a team like this totally on purpose.\n\nBroncos end Penrith dynasty in NRL finals thriller Photo shows Broncos celebrate Deine Mariner's last-gasp try against Penrith. Adam Reynolds nails a sideline conversion with three minutes left to send the Broncos into the NRL grand final and end Penrith's dynasty with a 16-14 win at Lang Park.\n\nYou cannot teach what Brisbane has got, and you cannot learn the lessons it has found in the depths of its soul in its last two matches as it stared down big deficits and shortening time.\n\nThey came out of the grave, but neither of the wins was a resurrection because, although the Broncos had been buried alive and even though it was partially of their own doing, they weren't dead.\n\nComing back against the Raiders was one thing, but coming back against Penrith \u2014 the patron saints for the age of optimisation, who had gone 98 games without defeat since the start of 2020 in matches where it led by 12 points or more \u2014 is near a miracle.\n\nIn the first half, the Broncos were up for the fight physically but seemed loose and a little scattered, and in front of a Lang Park crowd that howled like a beast, they wanted it almost too badly.\n\nThe returning Adam Reynolds could not link with Reece Walsh, and nor could Ezra Mam when he came on the field.\n\nWalsh grabs the Sun to light up Brisbane's season Photo shows A man celebrates after winning a rugby league match Brisbane and Canberra went to the great beyond in their golden point finals match and it was Reece Walsh who led the Broncos to the promised land.\n\nChances were missed and Penrith turned the screws, but, for the first time in age, they were not tight enough, and by the end, we entered a realm beyond what we normally know.\n\nWalsh, who wears stardom so easily he seems born to it and for whom no moment is ever too large, had the bravery to throw a no-look offload to Deine Mariner for the equalising try, and the sense to give the ball to Reynolds for the decisive conversion.\n\nPayne Haas, who defied belief in playing 80 minutes in the middle of the field and proved yet again he's one of a kind, found something late to put the pressure on Nathan Cleary and stop a potential two-point field goal.\n\nEver since their loss in the 2023 grand final and through large swathes of this season, the Broncos have not always found it easy to be a good team, but when it has really mattered, they have found a way to be a great one.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nWith all that in mind, Sunday shapes as the ultimate clash of not just styles, but ways to live.\n\nOne team is trusting a way that has led to success since before some of them were born, the other is running on faith that the path will continue to appear before them as they race into a future they cannot fully see.\n\nThe Victorians look to their heads before their hearts, and the Queenslanders are the other way round, only for both of them to wind up in the same place with what seems like an equal chance at the ultimate prize.\n\nNeither team is perfect. Neither team would want to be, and you don't need to be to take the trophy home.\n\nBecoming who they are is what has brought them here and what they will trust to take them the rest of the way to paradise.",

        "text": "A potentially deadly tick-borne disease that attacks a dog's immune system is now \"endemic\" across northern Australia.\n\nThe rapid spread of canine ehrlichiosis since it was first detected in Australia in 2020 \"has left a lot of destruction in its wake\", veterinarian Liisa Ahlstrom said.\n\n\"It's endemic, which means we're never getting rid of it,\" Dr Ahlstrom said.\n\n\"A lot of dogs have died from this disease \u2026 it's well and truly established across northern Australia.\"\n\nEhrlichiosis is transmitted by infected brown dog ticks. (Supplied: AMRRIC)\n\nDeceptive symptoms\n\nEhrlichiosis is a bacterial disease transmitted quickly when an infected brown dog tick bites a dog.\n\nThe disease presents in three phases, and Dr Ahlstrom said in the first stage symptoms could appear around two weeks after infection.\n\nCloudy eyes is one of the symptoms of ehrlichiosis. (Supplied: Gillian Tenni)\n\nSymptoms include fever, cloudy eyes, lethargy, enlarged lymph nodes, bleeding from the nose, under-skin bleeding and rapid weight loss.\n\n\"Some dogs will die in this early stage, but most dogs will recover and appear to be well,\" she said.\n\nThe second phase, where visible symptoms disappear, could be deceptive, according to Dr Ahlstrom.\n\nShe said, although the dog may appear to have recovered, the bacteria would have entered its bone marrow.\n\n\"You enter this subclinical phase, then months later \u2014 or even years later \u2014 they'll get really sick again,\" she said.\n\nBy the third and terminal phase, she said most dogs would die, even with treatment.\n\n\"They bleed uncontrollably because they're not making blood cells anymore and can't clot their blood,\" Dr Ahlstrom said.\n\nPet owners in northern Australia are being urged to take preventative action. (Supplied: Gillian Tenni)\n\nOnce a dog has been infected, treatment in the form of rigorous antibiotics is available but it needs to be administered as early as possible.\n\n\"If you suspect your dog's a little bit unwell, talk to your vet straight away because they're going to have a much better chance of survival if diagnosed early,\" Dr Ahlstrom said.\n\nMisconceptions around prevention\n\nVeterinarian Dr Ally Reid owns a practice in Cloncurry, in north-west Queensland.\n\nThe outback vet said she had treated up to a dozen cases in the past year, an increase from the year before.\n\n\"We're getting dogs from further out in the Gulf, where those sorts of things aren't monitored as well,\" she said.\n\nDr Ally Reid has seen an increase in cases among dogs in north-west Queensland. (Supplied: Ally Reid)\n\nWith no available vaccine, Dr Reid said prevention was vital.\n\n\"If you're getting ticks attached and biting, then you've got the risk that's already spreading the disease, so your repellents are a much more effective way to stop that spread from occurring,\" she said.\n\nBecause transmission from the brown dog tick happens quickly, Dr Reid recommended using a preventative collar in combination with oral tick medication.\n\nDr Gillian Tenni works 120 kilometres west, in Mount Isa, and said she had seen around 30 cases in the past year.\n\n\"I feel a lot of dogs may be infected with the disease without the owner realising,\" she said.\n\n\"The best prevention is something that will kill and repel the tick before it bites and transmits the disease.\"\n\nVets say a repellent collar is necessary to protect dogs from the brown dog tick. (ABC North Queensland: Mia Knight)\n\n'Well-suited to Australia'\n\nBrown dog ticks can be found in backyards, under buildings, inside homes and in the bush.\n\n\"This is a tick that loves warm weather and it can withstand drought and floods,\" Dr Ahlstrom said.\n\n\"[It's] a tick that is so well-suited to Australia.\"\n\nIt is not known how ehrlichiosis entered Australia but it was first detected in Western Australia in 2020 and north Queensland in 2022. It is now also present in the Northern Territory and South Australia.\n\nBrown dog ticks live in areas north of the dotted line. (Supplied: Biosecurity Tasmania)\n\nWhen the disease first arrived in Australia it was notifiable, so if a vet suspected that a dog had ehrlichiosis they had to report it, meaning initial case numbers were tracked.\n\n\"It was still very much kind of the tip of the iceberg because of the regions where the disease is most prevalent,\" Dr Ahlstrom said.\n\nNow at endemic status, ehrlichiosis does not have to be reported.\n\n\"There's really no way of knowing the prevalence,\" Dr Ahlstrom said.",

(ABC Mildura-Swan Hill: Peter Quattrocelli) The grant was a five-year contract, which means the relief centres must wait until at least 2030 to reapply.\n\nMs Miatke said her organisation had been given \"no explanation\" as to why its grant application was unsuccessful.\n\n\"There's just so many sad cases out there, where if we hadn't intervened families and children wouldn't have got the help that they really needed, and it's just heartbreaking to think that we wouldn't be able to do that help in the future.\"\n\nFeeding the needy for almost 30 years\n\nThe food centre received about $80,000 in previous years from the Commonwealth grant.\n\nMs Miatke said that money translated into about $500,000 worth of benefits to clients when it was coupled with donations from local businesses and residents. Last year, about 3,000 people came to the centre.\n\nShe said the service would not be able to survive on donations alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nChristian Emergency Food Centre in Horsham will lose its federal government funding at the end of this month.

        "text": "Ugly scenes broke out at golf's Ryder Cup in the United States after a beer was launched from the crowd, almost hitting Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy and his wife, Erica.\n\nEurope dominated at the New York course to retain the trophy, having claimed victory 13 out of 19 times since 1979.\n\nBut a tense and often unruly atmosphere came to a head on the weekend, when a cup of beer almost struck the European star and his partner.\n\nThe incident occurred after the second day of competition, after McIlroy and Shane Lowry had defeated Americans Justin Thomas and Cam Young in the four-balls.\n\nFootage shows McIlroy turning back to the crowd to remonstrate after the incident.\n\nA second angle of the incident appears to show that the beer was being held by one fan in the air, before another fan slapped it out of his hand towards the couple.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, a Ryder Cup MC employed to warm up the American crowd stepped down from her role and apologised after leading an offensive chant aimed at McIlroy.\n\nComedian Heather McMahan joined in with the crowd on the first tee yesterday as they chanted \"f*** you, Rory!\" at Europe's star player.\n\nHer chant rang out over the public address system and was caught on recordings.\n\nThe PGA of America said in a statement that McMahan had apologised.\n\n\"Heather has extended an apology to Rory McIlroy and Ryder Cup Europe and has stepped down from hosting the first tee of the Ryder Cup,\" it said.\n\nEuropean captain Luke Donald accused American fans of \"crossing the line\" after his players were subjected to heckling, with comments repeatedly aimed at McIlroy as he prepared to play shots.\n\nFans were fired up from day one after a visit from president Donald Trump, who watched on from behind bullet proof glass after rallying the crowd.\n\nEurope dominates again to claim Ryder Cup\n\nMeanwhile, the Americans were left searching for answers in what is becoming a lopsided series.\n\nThe Americans at least showed a pulse on the final day and made Europe sweat, storming back from the largest last day deficit ever against Europe with real hope.\n\nShane Lowry, who contended with the unruly New York crowds all week, had the last word. He birdied three of the last four holes, and his final putt will be part of Ryder Cup lore for Europe.\n\nShane Lowry sank the crucial putt which saw Europe retain the Ryder Cup. (Getty Images: Vaughn Ridley)\n\nRussell Henley had a 1-up lead, but his 10-foot birdie putt on the 18th to win the match was short.\n\nLowry holed his 6-foot birdie to halve the match, giving Europe the 14 points it needed to retain the cup as the defending champion. Three matches remained on the course.\n\nLowry said to his caddie walking up the 18th, \"I have a chance to do the coolest thing in my life.\"\n\nAnd he did just that.\n\nTeam Europe celebrate with the Ryder Cup after winning on American soil. (Getty Images: Jared C Tilton)\n\nEurope now has captured the cup 13 out of 19 times since 1979, the start of the modern era, and now has won five of the last 10 Ryder Cups on US soil.\n\nEurope's best players starred at Bethpage Black even as New York fans hurled abuse, building a record seven-point lead going into the 12 singles matches.\n\nEurope put a half-point on the board before a shot was hit. Viktor Hovland, who had a summer neck injury flare up on Saturday, was forced to withdraw. Harris English, whose name had been put in the secret envelope, also sat out and the match was declared halved.\n\nThe Americans had to win nine of the 11 matches and halve another and they put up an astonishing fight, finally hearing cheers for the US instead of only vitriol toward Europe.",

        "text": "India has held its nerve in the last over to win cricket's Asia Cup for the ninth time with a five-wicket victory over arch-rival Pakistan with only two balls remaining.\n\nBut a reported refusal to claim the trophy after the match led to farcical scenes, as Indian players pretended to lift an invisible cup and then showed their empty hands to fans to mimic holding the award.\n\nReports suggested India did not want to accept the trophy from Pakistan Cricket Board chief and head of Asian Cricket Council Mohsin Naqvi.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav (right) pretends to carry the trophy to the Indian team. (Getty Images: Surjeet Yadav/MB Media)\n\n\"I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight,\" presenter Simon Doull said.\n\n\"So that does conclude the post-match presentation.\"\n\nTilak Varma scored 69 not out for India off 53 balls in Monday morning's (AEST) final, including a crucial six against Haris Rauf in the 20th over.\n\nRinku Singh hit the winning runs with a four \u2014 the only ball Singh faced in the entire tournament.\n\nPut into bat, Pakistan had earlier collapsed from 1-113 to 146 all out in 19.1 overs at Dubai International Cricket Stadium.\n\nThat looked like being enough after defending champion India's terrible start to its innings, dropping to 3-20 after four overs, including the prized wicket of Abhishek Sharma (5).\n\nPakistan's Faheem Ashraf celebrates after dismissing India's Abhishek Sharma. (Getty Images: Francois Nel)\n\nBut Varma and Shivam Dube (33) led the recovery as India reached 150-5 in 19.4 overs.\n\nVarma added 57 off 50 balls with Sanju Samson (24) but the game-changing partnership was between Varma and Dube (33 off 22 balls). The duo added 60 off 40 balls to snatch the game out of Pakistan's hands.\n\nIt was India's second Asia Cup victory after 2016, and ninth overall since 1984, across formats.\n\nThis was the first India-Pakistan final in Asia Cup history, which started in 1984. The two sides had already met twice earlier in this tournament \u2014 in group play and Super Four \u2014 both won comfortably by India.\n\nIndia's cricketers refused to shake hands with Pakistan after both those games and there were no handshakes at Sunday's toss or at the end of the game.\n\nCaptains Surya Kumar Yadhav and Salman Agha before the game.

He was out caught for five off Faheem Ashraf.\n\nAshraf struck again to send back Shubman Gill for 12, while Shaheen Afridi got rid of skipper Suryakumar Yadav for just one.\n\nYadav's miserable tournament ended with a total of 72 runs, while Sharma finished as the top run-scorer \u2014 314 runs in seven innings at an average of 44.85 and a strike rate of 200.\n\nBut India was in deep trouble at 3-36 in the power play. Varma and Samson calmly rebuilt the innings without taking unnecessary risks. Samson faced 21 deliveries and only hit one six.\n\nSamson was out in the 13th over, caught off spinner Abrar Ahmed, leaving India still needing another partnership.\n\nVarma and Dube met the challenge. Dube hit two sixes and two fours, while Varma reached 50 off 41 balls.\n\nTilak Varma celebrates victory after hitting the winning runs against Pakistan in the Asia Cup final. (Getty Images: Francois Nel)\n\nOverall, Varma hit three fours and four sixes. He stayed calm even when Dube was out in the penultimate over.\n\nRauf bowled the final over with India needing 10 more runs for victory, and Varma got eight of them off the first two balls \u2014 including his fourth six. Singh then finished off with two balls to spare.\n\nEarlier, Pakistan fumbled a great start and lost its last nine wickets for 33 runs in 39 deliveries.\n\nSahibzada Farhan (57 runs in 38 balls) and Fakhar Zaman (46 in 35) had given Pakistan a solid start at 0-84 but number three Saim Ayub (14) was the only other Pakistan batter to reach double figures. Farhan hit five fours and three sixes.\n\nFans were more receptive of each other than the players were, with Indians and Pakistanis mingling in the Dubai stadium. (Getty Images: Surjeet Yadav/MB Media)\n\nLeft-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav took 4-30 in four overs. Jasprit Bumrah, Varun Chakravarthy and Axar Patel claimed two wickets each.\n\nBumrah claimed the last wicket as Pakistan's innings ended in 19.1 overs.\n\nPakistan had enjoyed the power play \u2014 scoring 45 without loss \u2014 and was 87-1 at the halfway point.\n\nFarhan reached his 50 off 35 balls \u2014 his second of the tournament and also against India. Chakravarthy got the breakthrough as Farhan was caught in the deep in the 10th over. Even so, Pakistan was past 100 in 11.2 overs and looked set for a good score.\n\nCan't get enough cricket from Grandstand? Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.\n\nKuldeep Yadav started the fightback in his second spell of two overs.\n\n\"They had a great start at like 100-1. But we knew if you get a couple quick wickets, new batters will find it tough to carry the momentum,\" the spinner said.\n\n\"I was bowling my final over and looking to get them out.\"\n\nHe broke the back of Pakistan's innings, dismissing Salman Agha (8), Shaheen Afridi (0) and Ashraf (0) as the lower-middle order wilted under pressure. The turning point had come when Zaman was caught out in the 15th over against Chakravarthy.\n\nThe Asia Cup has marked a resumption of cricket ties between India and Pakistan only months after the neighbouring countries were engaged in a tense border situation in May that disrupted the IPL and the Pakistan Super League.\n\nThere were no handshakes at the toss, where India skipper Suryakumar Yadav spoke with former India cricketer-turned-broadcaster Ravi Shastri and Pakistan captain Agha talked with former Pakistan cricketer-turned-broadcaster Waqar Younis.\n\nPakistan had named an unchanged team for the match while India all-rounder Hardik Pandya missed out owing to a niggle, replaced by Rinku Singh.\n\nBumrah and Shivam Dube returned for India, with Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana out.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

        "text": "If you look closely enough, low to the ground, there are little creatures all over the State Library of New South Wales.\n\nThe rows of ducklings are a breadcrumb-trail invitation up the stately stairs and into an intriguing new exhibition that celebrates one of Australia and New Zealand's best-loved children's authors \u2014 Pamela Allen.\n\nFree and open until mid-2027, The Curious World of Pamela Allen is an Australian first, bringing the work of the beloved author-illustrator both off the page and out of the archives into a larger-than-life physical space.\n\nAged 91, Allen has published more than 60 picture books from 1980 to today \u2014 including eight illustrated for other authors \u2014 selling millions of copies. Thirty-one of her books are still in print, comprising generationally loved characters Mr McGee, Bertie and the Bear, Belinda, Alexander and the motley crew of animals who sank a boat.\n\nLoading...\n\nIt is the first time Allen has exhibited her illustrations, and a rare appearance of her work beyond the page or the theatrical stage.\n\nKeeping tight control of her designs over her career and maintaining integrity of Allen's work was paramount in achieving the interactive family exhibition.\n\n\"It's tasteful. They've done a very, very beautiful job. I'm very proud of it, because it's a great acclamation and celebration for me,\" Allen says.\n\nAn invitation to read and play\n\nIn the hallway leading into the exhibition, cut-outs of Allen's clouds, birds, umbrellas and characters float high above the heads of children.\n\nThe Curious World of Pamela Allen invites children \u2014 and adults \u2014 to enter the world of her books. (Supplied: Gene Ramirez)\n\nFrom the entry, Mr McGee's head looms large, a structure that is an immediate invitation to sit on the side of the brim of his hat and play on the other side, featuring a bounty of dress-up hats and a mirror.\n\nThe playful celebration of Allen's work continues with a slide through Mr McGee's tree, a giant digital book of Bertie and the Bear with pages turned by waving arms, and model characters to place in a little red boat, with waves projected on the floor.\n\nThe space is not just for children; original illustrations, drafts and letters from Allen's archive enlighten how books are made from draft to print.\n\nThere are surprises along the way, revealing changes of titles and characters, along with lesser-known and out-of-print works.\n\nPamela Allen's classic book Who Sank The Boat forms part of the new interactive display at the State Library of NSW. (Supplied: Gene Ramirez)\n\nCurator Sarah Morley, who has worked on Pamela Allen's archive since 2018, when she received a remarkable letter offering the acquisition, says integrating children's and adults' experiences within the space was intentional.\n\n\"We went into it with a very deliberate intention that it be for children and families. We've done picture book exhibitions before, but this one we wanted the design to be interactive and incorporate the original artworks as well,\" Morley says.\n\n\"My books are a triangle with the parents,\" says Allen, describing the theatre of parents reading to a child, with the drama of the voice essential to the reading experience of the non-reading child.\n\n\"It's not just the book. There are two people \u2014 the child and the parent reading,\" she says.\n\nLeaving room for imagination\n\nThere are small details everywhere \u2014 thin black lines throughout, on chairs and tables, contributing to the storybook environment, and the flow of colours and illustrations through each space, leaving plenty of white space, true to Allen's intent to have as few distractions as possible.\n\nHer commitment to the perfect theatrical picture book was so strong that she would push against her publishers when they asked for less white space and more filled-in scenery.\n\nThe exhibition asks visitors to interact with Pamela Allen's stories. (Supplied: Gene Ramirez)\n\n\"I wouldn't do it!\" she says.\n\n\"If you look at my books, there's only the information you have to have.\"\n\nSLNSW's exhibition designers create subtle divisions in space to explore a variety of Allen's books.\n\n\"With giant elements, we wanted kids to have a sense of amazement and awe when they walk in and feel, wow, I am walking into one of Pamela's picture books,\" curator Morley says.\n\nReading as connection\n\nThe exhibition is not just a playground of reading, but also an insight into the creative mind of one of Australia and New Zealand's greatest creators.\n\nHer recipe for excellence in children's books is one she wants to share, in order to better educate would-be writers, as well as parents, carers and educators wanting to better know how to engage children in reading as an intimate theatrical experience, unique to each family.\n\n\"It's an experience, and that's the thing I think I want people to realise,\" she says.\n\n\"The security and the warmth of sharing something. People do talk to me about memories.\n\n\" You remember this book or something and it's usually because it was a great time with your father, or what we used to do when you were reading it with your mother. Cock-a-doodle-doo! Make the most of everything! \"\n\nLooking to Rosie's Walk by Pat Hutchins as a beautiful and inquisitive exemplary picture book, Allen decided on her method while walking over the Sydney Harbour Bridge after meeting with children's publisher Anne Ingram in 1979.\n\nAllen prefers an economy of words, no distractions, never repeating information between the text and the images, and, above all, drama: voices, anticipation, page turns and questions.\n\nABC Radio National's Top 100 Books of the 21st Century Top 100 Books is Radio National's new annual countdown where we hand over the reins to you to vote for your favourite books, and then we celebrate the Top 100 in a big weekend broadcast!\n\nUnlike many children's authors who speak regularly at schools, reading to a public audience has rarely been on Allen's agenda, and the opening event on September 21 was an unusual treat for her to share her latest book, Cock-a-Doodle-Doo! with the exact gusto she expects of her readers.\n\n\"I'm going to be a great rooster,\" Allen chuckles before the opening.\n\nComplete with a cast of dress-up characters, with costumes lovingly sewn by SLNSW education officer Susan Owen, there was a musical marching procession up the stairs to cut the ribbon and declare the celebration of Pamela Allen officially open.\n\nThe costumes of Pamela Allen book characters were made by Susan Owen (back left). (Supplied: Gene Ramirez)\n\n\"An exhibition is the pinnacle, being able to share these collections with everybody because this collection here at the State Library is phenomenal, but it's the people's collection. It's for everyone,\" curator Morley said.\n\n\"Being able to add Pamela to the canon of Australian literature among all the amazing Australian authors and illustrators that we collect is really important.\"\n\nThe Curious World of Pamela Allen is at the State Library of NSW until July 2027.",

It makes life a bit harder, for sure.\"\n\nPenrith had been ready to seek an exemption to play Sorensen in the grand final, which would have fallen within the 11-day period that a category-one assessment requires a player to miss.\n\nHow Reynolds's game-winning moment played out Photo shows Adam Reynolds shouts after kicking a goal against Penrith. Adam Reynolds took the kicking tee from the Broncos' biggest star in the biggest moment of their season so far, and it paid off in the biggest way possible.\n\nBut it is now believed the club will not query the NRL's decision to rule Sorensen out of the game, despite the forward passing his assessment.\n\nPenrith's tight two-point preliminary final loss came after the team had wrestled itself back into premiership contention following a dismal start to the year.\n\nThe four-time reigning premiers slipped to last on the ladder after round 12, before a nine-game winning streak helped them lock up seventh spot.\n\nIn premiership history, no team had ever won a finals game after sitting last so late in a season, but the Panthers won two en route to Sunday's epic against Brisbane.\n\nCleary was still reticent to consider the season a success, as dreams of a fifth consecutive premiership slipped away.\n\n\"I'm not sure about a success. It's still a good year,\" he said.\n\n\"Our start really put us under pressure, and ultimately that's part of the season. That was not good enough. I have to take responsibility for that.\n\n\"After that, there was some really good stuff. Even the finals series, I thought we handled it pretty well.

        "text": "Even his \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on all imports could be replaced by Section 232 versions, should the US Supreme Court uphold lower court judgements that they are illegal, although (a) the Supreme Court has a recent history of giving the administration what it asks for and (b) it would be far more time-consuming to use the section, which requires a particular and detailed investigatory process, and the administration would have to refund billions of dollars of tariff revenue in the meantime. Citing national security threats as a pretext for hitting imports of kitchen cabinets or furniture with his tariffs is clearly an artifice to enable Trump to build a wall against, it seems, almost all manufactured imports and the raw or semi-finished components to make them. It\u2019s also a way of maximising revenue for a government that is awash in deficits and debt. Next up in Trump\u2019s war on the world. The kitchen. Credit: istock Last year the US raised $US90 billion ($137.4 billion) from customs and excise duties. Recently, that revenue has been running at close to $US30 billion a month and it will keep rising as the most recently added tariffs (the reciprocal tariffs went live only last month) start to contribute.\n\nMost estimates of the tariffs are that they will generate around $US2.5 trillion over a decade, if they remain in place over that period. Loading They are of course, a particularly regressive tax on American consumers \u2013 they are paid for either by the US importer or are passed onto consumers via higher prices, with lower-income households hit hardest \u2013 despite Trump\u2019s continued assertions that foreign countries are paying them. The Yale Budget Lab says they will cost the equivalent of an average annual per-household loss of income of $US2400 in 2025 dollars, will lower US GDP growth by 0.4 per centage points in the long run and increase the unemployment rate by 0.7 percentage points next year. They will also impact the US inflation rate, indeed they are already are impacting it.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve Board\u2019s preferred measure of inflation is the core personal consumption expenditures index. On Friday the index, excluding volatile food and energy prices, showed a 0.3 percentage point increase in August relative to July. In July, then index rose 0.2 percentage points from June. The index is 2.9 per cent ahead of the same month last year. He\u2019s also foreshadowed national security tariffs on robotics, industrial machinery., semiconductors and medical devices and no doubt will come up with some other products deemed critical to America\u2019s security. In other words, prices and inflation are ticking up even before the full impact of the main tariffs \u2013 the baseline and reciprocal tariffs on the rest of the world \u2013 is felt. That\u2019s despite the fact that most of the tariffs\u2019 costs have, so far, been absorbed in the margins of US businesses rather than passed onto consumers.\n\nMany businesses also boosted their imports at pre-tariff prices significantly ahead of the well-flagged introduction of the main tariffs, allowing them to maintain pre-tariff pricing until their inventories have been depleted. There\u2019s no evidence that exporters to the US have lowered their prices to absorb any material proportion of the tariffs\u2019 costs. Loading Companies also wouldn\u2019t want to raise prices and lose sales while there is a possibility the Supreme Court will deem the tariffs illegal and force the revenue to be returned to importers. The full effects of the existing tariffs won\u2019t be seen for months and, with Trump regularly adding to the list of affected products, perhaps well into next year. While the impact on prices and inflation has been relatively muted to date, within the revised data released by the Commerce Department last week that showed robust 3.8 per cent growth in real GDP in the June quarter (after negative growth in the first quarter), business spending fell by an annualised 5.6 per cent in real terms. Business spending is being chilled by the uncertainties generated by Trump\u2019s trade wars and immigration policies.\n\nWith wages growth relatively flat, the overall growth in the economy appears to have been powered by consumption funded by households drawing on their savings, perhaps to get in ahead of the tariffs. That\u2019s not sustainable. The US has only days to avert another threat to growth, the shutting down of the US government if congressional Republicans and Democrats can\u2019t find a short-term compromise before the government\u2019s funding runs out on Wednesday, the start of America\u2019s new financial year.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size On a quiet street in Sydney\u2019s inner west, tucked in between warehouses, is an unassuming building where sounds of squeaking shoes on matte red floors and the echoing of balls ricocheting off bats fill the air. For years, the RTTC Table Tennis Academy in Rhodes has been Sydney\u2019s hotspot for nurturing world-class table tennis players, training more than 300 students each week. But that could all end after the state government\u2019s three-person Housing Delivery Authority recommended the fast-tracking of a proposal to build 2020 homes on the site. A Herald analysis of some of the largest HDA projects reveals a considerable gap in amenity \u2013 some of the proposed homes will be just a stone\u2019s throw away from shops, train stations, schools, and hospitals, while some residents will live up to 17 kilometres away from train stations and even further from schools, shops, or emergency departments. RTTC Table Tennis Academy on Averill Street in Rhodes, Sydney. Credit: James Brickwood The HDA\u2019s recommendations bypass local councils, which accelerates development approval times for major residential developments above $60 million in metropolitan areas and $30 million in regional NSW. Since February, more than 91,100 potential homes have been declared state significant under the HDA pathway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRhodes If it goes ahead, the development will mean the table tennis academy on Averill Street will have to shut its doors so the building can be demolished to make way for 2020 apartments, resulting in a loss of public amenity in an already densely populated suburb. It has become a second home for 15-year-old Daisy Xie, who for the past five years has attended at least four times a week. Xie said closure of the centre that was a perfect in-between meeting point for her and her playing partner would upend their training. \u201cIt\u2019s already difficult to find a training partner that suits you. Besides, this venue is so good \u2013 if we have to move elsewhere it will disrupt training and make things a lot more inconvenient,\u201d she said. \u201cThe centre has flat, even grounds, so the ball won\u2019t roll around. It\u2019s also well lit and has air conditioning. It will be difficult to find a location just as suitable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClub manager Jecie Yao said it signed a 10-year lease with the landlord in 2023. But the uncertain future of the centre means it could be asked at any point to close up and relocate, which would present countless logistical nightmares. \u201cWe hope it\u2019s not happening, but I know eventually it will happen. It\u2019s pretty tough when a business has to relocate. We\u2019ll have to do the marketing and start from scratch,\u201d Yao said. Rhodes has no schools, and the proposed development is a 12-minute walk to Rhodes station. Marsden Park In between a permanently shuttered laboratory and an expanse of overgrown fields, is a package of empty land in Marsden Park that could have 800 homes. The proposed greenfield development at 264A South Street is 4.3 kilometres from Schofields train station, 2.2km from the nearest grocery store, and almost 6.8 km away from the closest primary school and high school. The closest hospital with an emergency department is 6.7km away, in Mount Druitt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichmond Road is also the only major road in \u2013 or out \u2013 of Marsden Park, meaning the already congested corridor could buckle under pressure from more residents moving in. Located 50km north-west of the CBD, Marsden Park is a relatively new suburb known for its sprawling small-lot, dark-roofed large houses that have become synonymous with homogenous new-build homes on Sydney\u2019s periphery. Marsden Park is far from basic amenities. Credit: Rhett Wyman The population has boomed in these greenfield suburbs. Marsden Park and its neighbouring suburb Shanes Park added nearly 18,000 people between 2019 and 2023, bringing its total population to 23,778. Experts have previously flagged issues with these fringe suburbs, such as rising heat, poor transport links, minimal recreational space, and the absence of essential amenities. Appin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe largest development recommended by the HDA comprises 2499 homes in Appin, 71km south-west of Sydney on the road between Wollongong and Campbelltown. While Appin sits within the Greater Macarthur growth area, and is a key plank in the state\u2019s plan to build 377,000 homes by 2029, amenities and infrastructure are few and far between for its 3500 residents. The closest hospital in Campbelltown is more than an 18-kilometre drive away, and Douglas Park, the nearest train station is almost 17 kilometres from the proposed site. While there is a long-term vision for nearly 16,000 new homes in Appin, a cap of 2499 homes has been put in place, and will only increase when wastewater and infrastructure such as roads and sewage systems are delivered first by Transport for NSW and Sydney Water. Draft plans from the developer include three new local centres with shops and services, new transport corridors and road upgrades, three new school sites, and sites for emergency service facilities.

Mason Cox, 34, faces an uncertain future, while Dan Houston \u2013 and the Pies \u2013 will agree they need more from him next season. Bobby Hill, having missed so much football because of personal issues, remains a close watch. Something to look forward to: Houston was not the same counter-puncher he was at Port Adelaide in his first year with the Magpies \u2013 expect that to change next year. He is exemplary with ball in hand, and needs to have more of it. Skipper Darcy Moore had an indifferent season, and may need to revisit the balance between pure defending and hunting the ball. Get that right, and the Magpies \u2013 already built on defence \u2013 will be even stronger. Coach Craig McRae wants a blend of good draft picks and established players through this trade/draft period. They missed out on Jack Silvagni, but will trade for Swans\u2019 forward Jack Buller.\n\nAnother established defender may be front of mind, for Jeremy Howe, 35, is showing signs of wear and tear.

The Crows not only leapt back into the finals for the first time since 2017, but won 12 of their final 13 home-and-away games to finish as minor premier. Matthews Nicks\u2019 game plan, essentially built on going long down the line, held up during the season proper. Taylor Walker may not like what he hears from the Crows\u2019 bosses in his end-of-season meeting. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Skipper Jordan Dawson and full-forward Riley Thilthorpe were All-Australians, while fellow forwards Taylor Walker and Darcy Fogarty, and forward-midfielder Ben Keays, also enjoyed strong home-and-away seasons. Former Demon Alex Neal-Bullen was a fine acquisition, and could be a future skipper.\n\nIzak Rankine provided creativity up field and close to goal, and was badly missed through suspension for a homophobic slur in September. \u201cWhat it did do was it changed the dynamic of our group,\u201d Nicks said of Rankine\u2019s absence. \u201cIzak is, and this is my opinion, one of the best players in the game, so I think if any team loses their best player, then it becomes quite challenging to replace that.\u201d It could be a rough exit meeting for: Taylor Walker. The champion forward, 35, is off contract, and his time may be up after a modest finals campaign. The Crows may feel Thilthorpe and Fogarty need to be empowered and shoulder greater responsibility. Fellow veteran Brodie Smith, 33, is also weighing up his future. Something to look forward to: This was a year when the Crows built a foundation for what should be a five-year premiership tilt. Yes, they failed to win a quarter in their two finals defeats, becoming the first minor premiers in more than 40 years to be dumped from September in straight sets, but that sting should fire this squad. However, they do have holes. While unbeaten in 13 games against bottom nine teams, they were 6-7 against top nine teams, their scoring and defence dropping off.\n\nThey need another X-factor in addition to Rankine, while a forward line of three talls didn\u2019t hold-up in September, when the ball is on the ground more. Another strong defender would also help. Nicks will need to tinker with his game plan. As he said after the semi-final loss to Hawthorn, it\u2019s harder to move the ball the way you want in the finals when the intensity rises. The Crows have been linked with off-contract Lions forward Callum Ah Chee.\n\nBest and fairest tip: Jordan Dawson.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Suns gun Matt Rowell takes a physical battering in every game he plays. Credit: Getty Images Gold Coast (sixth after finals loss)\n\nWins: 16 Losses: 9 Draft picks 6, 14, 15, 32, 56, 68 What went well: The Suns have finally risen. This was a breakthrough season for a club, which not only made its maiden finals run in its 15th attempt, but conjured a miraculous win over the Dockers in Perth. Skipper Noah Anderson and fellow midfielder Matt Rowell were first-time All-Australians, their sustained efforts in the midfield a sight to behold. The physical punishment Rowell takes reminds us of the hits an NFL running back endures. Marking forward Ben King was superb in front of goal but will need to add a new trick or two. Fellow forward Ben Long had a breakout campaign, although he was disappointing in the semi-final, while recruits Daniel Rioli and John Noble delivered what was expected of them at half-back.\n\nSam Collins is a beast at full-back, Touk Miller delivered run and carry, while Bailey Humphrey showed signs of morphing into the Suns\u2019 version of Cam Rayner. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Jed Walter. The young forward was dropped after round 19 and did not return to the side. While the former Suns academy product is contracted for next season, he could be used in a trade for Carlton\u2019s Charlie Curnow. While a star in the making, Mac Andrew will face a strong review of his finals performances. Something to look forward to: There is plenty to look forward to with this emerging list, coach Damien Hardwick declaring his team is built for September. The base is there, it\u2019s now time to build internally and through canny trades. The Suns were too reliant on Rowell and Anderson, and need another robust midfielder who can deliver under pressure. The unicorn that is Ethan Read struggled in the semi-final but has the height and talent to be a long-term marking threat. They could lose Sam Flanders, who has two years remaining on his contract, and Malcolm Rosas, through the trade period.\n\nBest and fairest tip: Noah Anderson.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Fremantle (8th) Wins: 16. Losses: 8. Draft picks 13, 31, 38, 49, 67. What went well: After last year\u2019s meltdown, when they slipped from the top eight at the start of August to 10th by the end, the Dockers held firm this year and returned to the finals for the first time since 2022, winning 12 of their last 14 games to finish sixth. Caleb Serong again starred in the Fremantle midfield. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nThey adopted a more attacking gameplan after five losses from their first nine games, but failed to fully embrace this mantra in a stinging elimination final defeat to the Suns. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown so much throughout the year with the way we play our footy, the way we embrace challenges, the way we\u2019ve improved our footy on the road,\u201d coach Justin Longmuir said after the loss to the Suns. Marking talls Josh Treacy (44 goals) and Patrick Voss (37) had strong seasons, while Murphy Reid claimed the AFLPA\u2019s best young player award. Former premiership Tiger Shai Bolton (28) was arguably the recruit of the year. Defender Jordan Clark and midfield stud Caleb Serong were All-Australians, while Andrew Brayshaw was unlucky not to be.\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: Jye Amiss. While he played all 24 games, Amiss, a key marking tall, returned a modest 32 goals, and averaged career-lows in marks and disposals per game. He had only two touches (one goal) in the elimination final before being subbed off. Amiss could be a trade target. Then there\u2019s ruckman Sean Darcy. Will he and Luke Jackson continue to be a one-two punch in the ruck? We\u2019ll see. Something to look forward to: The Dockers are building nicely. They had an average age of just 24.9 years through the season \u2013 the fourth youngest in the competition. Fremantle ruckman Sean Darcy. Credit: AFL Photos AFL great James Hird has set high expectations for them next year, despite their loss to the Suns on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI think they have to be top four next year with their list and the way they\u2019ve had the final this year and the performances against the best teams in the competition. I\u2019ve really gotten locked in that top four next year,\u201d Hird said. But they cannot afford to have lulls and slip back into a defensive mindset when the pressure is at its greatest. This will be Longmuir\u2019s greatest challenge. Best and fairest: Caleb Serong.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik GWS (7th)\n\nWins: 16. Losses: 8. Draft picks: 12, 30, 36. What went well: After a dodgy first half of the year, the Giants won nine of their last 10 home-and-away games, scoring more than 100 points in each of them. In the end, they finished with one of the AFL\u2019s best attacking records, just two points behind third place. Toby Greene and his Giants were eliminated at home by the Hawks. Credit: AFL Photos At their best, they were absolutely awe-inspiring: their stunning third quarters against the Swans in the second Sydney derby of the season, plus their (eventually unsuccessful) comeback against Hawthorn in their elimination final, will live long in the memory. The challenge will be closing the gap between their frightening best and their timid worst. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Everyone. The Giants have now lost their past four finals, including two at home (and three in Sydney) \u2013 the sort of record that each player needs to take a varying degree of responsibility for, as well as the coaching group, and will require them all to look deeply within over the summer. September stumbles are becoming too much of a theme.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that they concede too many entries, which can\u2019t be wholly pinned on the six poor blokes in defence who had to deal with that avalanche. All things considered, they managed OK, but it felt unsustainable, and so it has proved. And there\u2019s a similar problem going the other way. When they\u2019re on, they\u2019re on, but the Giants\u2019 attack falls to pieces when they mindlessly blaze away inside 50 as they did against Hawthorn, which completely undermines their forward set-up. Composure in key moments is lacking in this side across every line, and that\u2019s not an easy thing to add. Sam Taylor is a star defender for GWS, but the Giants\u2019 defensive unit is under pressure. Credit: AFL Photos Something to look forward to: As Adam Kingsley said post-match, the Giants still have \u201call the pieces\u201d to contend, although their ageing stars are running out of petrol. But the window remains open, their next tier of rising stars will be better with another season under their belts and if they can address their inconsistencies, get to the psychological nub of their finals failures and have some better luck with injuries, there\u2019s no reason why they won\u2019t be back contending again in 2026. Best and fairest tip: Finn Callaghan showed exactly why St Kilda threw a $17 million, 10-year contract offer at him; thank heavens he said no. He and Tom Green (likely second in the best and fairest) run this team now.\n\n\u2013 Vince Rugari\n\nWestern Bulldogs (9th) Wins: 14. Losses: 9. Draft picks: 10, 28 What went well: Offensive power. The Doggies poured on the goals this season, scoring more points (2493) than any other team. Led by Marcus Bontempelli, Tom Liberatore, Ed Richards and an increasingly influential Sam Darcy up forward, they beat up teams with regularity. While that resulted in a 14-9 record, the team from the west missed the finals. The Bulldogs were an offensive juggernaut in 2025 but still missed finals. Credit: Getty Images\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: Jamarra Ugle-Hagan. The one-time No.1 draft pick has occupied so much of the Bulldogs top brass\u2019 time this season. It would be fascinating to witness his official exit meeting given there\u2019s so much to discuss for a player who didn\u2019t add to his tally of 67 AFL games this season. Defenders will be in the spotlight, too, but each player on the list will be pressed for explanations as to why the Dogs simply couldn\u2019t beat teams who were vying for finals spots. Something to look forward to: Plenty, to be truthful. The Dogs have recorded 14 wins in consecutive seasons; in 2024 they played finals, so they can\u2019t wallow in pity about what happened this year. Jamarra Ugle-Hagan didn\u2019t play a game for the Bulldogs this season. Credit: Justin McManus Darcy, at age 22, remains one of the most exciting young players in the game. Aaron Naughton\u2019s best season (65 goals) is a beacon of hope for even better things, too.\n\nBest and fairest tip: I\u2019ve landed on Ed Richards ahead of Tom Liberatore. Bontempelli\u2019s missed games through injury will cost him.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits Port Adelaide (13th) Wins: 8. Losses: 15. Draft picks: 26, 42, 60 What went well: That\u2019s tough to answer because this was an extremely disappointing year, despite Ken Hinkley\u2019s protestations the list is set up well for 2026. Port Adelaide chairman David Koch stuck with Ken Hinkley to the end. Credit: Getty Images\n\nHaving made a preliminary final last year, the Power slipped markedly. However, skipper Connor Rozee and fellow star midfielder Zak Butters were typically industrious, while forward Mitch Georgiades delivered a half-century of goals for the first time. Aliir Aliir enjoyed another stellar season in defence, while Travis Boak and Hinkley were given a classy send-off against the Suns, the victory fully deserved. Zak Butters won Port Adelaide\u2019s best and fairest award - the John Cahill Medal - for the third consecutive year in 2025. Credit: Getty Images It could be a rough exit meeting for: President David Koch and his board. The succession plan designed to ease Hinkley out and Josh Carr to prepare for the senior role next season was done with the best of intentions, but the scoreboard says it was a failure. If Hinkley wasn\u2019t the man to take the team forward, then Carr should have been immediately installed, and Hinkley given a thank-you payout for his years of fine service.\n\nSomething to look forward to: The Power should be back in the finals hunt next year, but they will need to get busy in the trade period. Do they have enough true stars? Missing out on Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera will hurt. Late season injuries have given the youngsters a chance. We like what we have seen of Jack Whitlock, who can play ruck and go forward. Best and fairest winner: Zak Butters.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Essendon (15th)\n\n\n\nWins: 6. Losses: 17. Draft picks: 4, 5, 22, 25. What went well: The Bombers have some superb youngsters. In his second year, Nate Caddy again gave glimpses of the player he could become, with 20 goals and more flashes of brilliance. Isaac Kako gave Bombers fans something to get excited about. Credit: AFL Photos Isaac Kako impressed with his smarts around goals and showed late in the season he can also be developed as a pinch-hitter in the centre square. Archie Roberts, the lowest draft pick of the trio, could end up being a steal. The teenager is advanced beyond his years, demonstrating composure and skill in a defence that was under siege.\n\nAngus Clarke is another of the club\u2019s 15 debutants this year who has provided Bombers fans with hope in a wretched campaign. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Ben Hobbs. In his fourth season, Hobbs, 21, failed to take a more significant role in the side. Worryingly for Hobbs, despite Essendon\u2019s litany of injuries, he was dropped for the first leg of the final round and could not break back into the team. Hobbs has stagnated in his past two seasons, reaching 20 disposals in just three of his past 30 games. His disposal remains a worry. If time has run out for the first-round pick from the 2021 draft, it would raise further queries on the Bombers\u2019 recruiting and player development. Something to look forward to: The draft. The Bombers have a strong hand in this year\u2019s draft after acquiring Melbourne\u2019s first selection through a pick swap last year. Even accounting for father/son, academy and NGA picks, the Bombers should have access to two very good youngsters.\n\nIf Sam Draper departs through free agency, that should deliver another first-round pick. Unfortunately for the Dons, this is not considered the strongest draft, but one experienced recruiter has said they would not be surprised if smokies emerge deeper in the pool. Best and fairest: Zach Merrett.\n\n\u2013 Andrew Wu West Coast (18th) Wins: 1. Losses: 22. Draft picks: 1, 14, 19, 32, 50.\n\nWhat went well: Sorry West Coast fans, this is not pretty. The Eagles have managed 11 wins in four seasons, including just one victory, over St Kilda, in a torturous 2025 season. But there\u2019s always a glimmer of hope and performances and players to celebrate. Two-time Richmond premiership player Jack Graham, who joined the Eagles for 2025, comfortably exceeded his career average for disposals (19.2 possessions per game this season) and had 7.8 tackles per game (which is considered \u201celite\u201d). It could be a rough exit meeting for: The defensive unit and the defence coaches. West Coast comfortably conceded the highest number of points (2438) this season, leaving them with a limp percentage of 60.1. If premierships are built from the backline, they need to focus there.\n\nIt will be fascinating to see the club\u2019s attitude towards Tim Kelly, who played 19 games in his sixth season with the Eagles. Something to look forward to: It couldn\u2019t get any worse, could it? If West Coast haven\u2019t bottomed out, where is the bottom? The Eagles can expect the No.2 draft pick as compensation for losing free agent Oscar Allen to Brisbane, so that\u2019s something. And Harley Reid is staying for now, having resisted interest from big Victorian clubs to extend until the end of 2028. Eagles fans can only look forward to better times ahead. Best and fairest tip: Jack Graham.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits\n\nNorth Melbourne (16th) Wins: 5 Losses: 17 Draws: 1 Draft picks: 20, 21, 39, 57 What went well: They made it out of the bottom two! The Kangaroos and coach Alastair Clarkson would have liked to see more progress on the ladder, but he remains bullish they are heading in the right direction. North Melbourne avoided another bottom-two finish. Credit: Getty Images\n\nAfter a torrid first six rounds and the odd thrashing beyond that, North were generally more competitive, including securing a draw with Brisbane, but there were no statement wins. Instead, they would be pleased with Harry Sheezel\u2019s transition to a midfield-forward role, the continued development of Colby McKercher and career-best seasons from Cam Zurhaar and Paul Curtis. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Will Phillips. The No.3 pick in the COVID-19-impacted 2020 draft class played only seven matches this season and does not appear to be in the Roos\u2019 plans. He should latch on somewhere, but needs to get going to save his career. Something to look forward to: Next year promises to be the season when North Melbourne finally take a genuine leap. How high that is remains to be seen, but the expectations must rise, even if that is as modest as aiming for between eight and 10 wins.\n\nThe young talent is there, and they may have finally found Nick Larkey\u2019s sidekick in Cooper Trembath. A stiffer defence and another progression from their midfield group should enable them to take another belated step. Best and fairest: Luke Davies-Uniacke.\n\n\u2013 Marc McGowan Richmond (17th)\n\nWins: 5. Losses: 18. Draft picks: 2,3 What went well: Plenty for a club that was widely tipped to sail through turbulent waters with a drastically young and inexperienced list. The season began on the best note possible with a stunning round-one win over Carlton. The nature of the victory, a come-from-behind triumph, set the tone for the season for both the Tigers and Blues. Throw in highlights from Maurice Rioli jnr, and all was swell. Tim Taranto had a strong season as one of the Tigers\u2019 on-field leaders. Credit: AFL Photos It could be a rough exit meeting for: The club\u2019s forwards and the forward coaches. The Tigers scored the fewest number of points (1449), less even than West Coast, a club that limped to one victory, compared to Richmond\u2019s five.\n\nVeteran spearhead Tom Lynch could cop a drive-by sledge for missing games. He played only 16 matches (due largely to a suspension) after a tough couple of years with injuries. Something to look forward to: There\u2019s so much to look forward to. Realistically, the Tigers will battle to replicate their win-loss tally (5-18) as they continue to develop their young group. It could be a case of the \u201csecond-year blues\u201d for a host of players. But Richmond will be eyeing off their matches against Carlton and the chance to knock them off again.\n\nBest and fairest tip: Tim Taranto.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits St Kilda (12th) Wins: 9. Losses: 14. Draft picks: 7, 43, 58. What went well: The Saints were a popular choice to sink into the bottom four, but finished three wins clear of that territory while prioritising youth. The Saints will welcome Tom De Koning in 2026 and welcome back Max King after another injury-riddled season. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nSt Kilda\u2019s round two upset of Geelong was a false dawn, but a peek at their upside. They also demolished Fremantle and executed the greatest three-quarter-time comeback from 46 points down against Melbourne. That latter win was the first of four in a row before they almost upset GWS in round 24. Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera\u2019s emergence as a top-liner was massive, while Max Hall followed Cooper Sharman and Max Heath as a mid-season draft success story. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Zak Jones. The brother of ex-Demons captain Nathan was not one of the five Saints who re-signed last week, and faces an uncertain future. Jones turns 31 in March, and St Kilda already made it clear they want to get younger in the midfield.\n\nSomething to look forward to: Another two years from Wanganeen-Milera, who they retained despite Adelaide and Port Adelaide wanting him. There is optimism about what Mattaes Phillipou, Darcy Wilson, Alix Tauru and Tobie Travaglia can become, while the likes of Hugo Garcia, Isaac Keeler, Hugh Boxshall and Lance Collard also show promise. Tom De Koning will be on the list in 2026, and Max King will hopefully be fit again. Best and fairest tip: Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera.\n\n\u2013 Marc McGowan Sydney (10th)\n\nWins: 12. Losses: 11. Draft picks: 9, 27, 45, 63. What went well: Having won just four of their first 12 games under new coach Dean Cox, the Swans showed fortitude to rebound and win eight of their final 11 games. Brodie Grundy returned to his best form for Sydney in 2025. Credit: AFL Photos Playmaker Isaac Heeney had a tough start, but then reminded everyone why he is a legitimate star. Chad Warner was a consistent threat through the midfield, but did not have the impact he enjoyed through 2022-24.\n\nA serious ankle injury through the pre-season sidelined Errol Gulden for months and seriously hurt the Swans\u2019 midfield and creative drive, just as his return in round 15 had the reverse effect. Brodie Grundy reinforced why he is one of the competition\u2019s premier ruckmen. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Skipper Callum Mills. For the Swans to make the leap next season, Mills needs to consistently be on the park. His 2024 campaign was derailed after injuring his rotator cuff in a Mad Monday celebration. He missed the first half of this year because of plantar fascia. He needs to lead the way in 2026. Something to look forward to: This has been a year of recalibration for the Swans, and learning, particularly for Cox, who is now more at ease in the top role after replacing John Longmire.\n\nWhile it feels somewhat of a wasted year, the Swans are still in top-four mode, and are likely to be strengthened through the trade period. They just need to get moving earlier next season. Best and fairest tip: Isaac Heeney.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Carlton (11th) Wins: 9. Losses: 14. Draft picks: 34, 44, 62*. What went well: Not much. George Hewett was one of few Blues to exceed expectations, putting together a career-best season in the midfield.\n\nJack Silvagni and Tom De Koning are both leaving the Blues. Credit: Getty Images Better known as a defensive onballer, Hewett became a prolific ball-winner in his own right. In his 12th season on an AFL list, the former Swan is a strong chance to win his first best and fairest award. Veteran Nick Haynes overcame a horror start at the club to become dependable defender. He deserves another year. Young midfielder Cooper Lord is one to watch. George Hewett stepped up for the Blues in 2025, but didn\u2019t get enough support. Credit: Getty Images The Blues blooded seven debutants, the best of whom looks to be key defender Harry O\u2019Farrell, who, unfortunately, injured his knee.\n\nOther gains were bitter-sweet. Jack Silvagni was a revelation in defence but played just 13 games and is now on the move. Ollie Hollands found plenty of the ball in his new role as a running defender but his kicking needs work. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Mitch McGovern. The Blues are keen to get money off their books and the writing is on the wall for the 30-year-old, who narrowly missed a games trigger that would have earned a contract extension. With Silvagni walking out and O\u2019Farrell to be unsighted for much of 2026, the defender may yet get another year, but it will be on the Blues\u2019 terms. Veterans Adam Saad and Blake Acres both had ordinary seasons. Something to look forward to: With mass change underway in the coaches box, free agents Tom De Koning and Silvagni confirming their departures, and ongoing chatter about Charlie Curnow, it\u2019s already been a turbulent off-season for the Blues, and the AFL home and away season isn\u2019t even officially over yet! Expect that turmoil to continue for some time yet.\n\nBut once they ride that out, there will be hope again. The departures of De Koning and Silvagni will strengthen the Blues\u2019 draft hand to acquire highly-rated Harry Dean as a father-son pick. Decimated by injury in 2025, the Blues can vault back into finals contention with a cleaner bill of health. Curnow (assuming he stays) and Sam Walsh had interrupted preseasons which severely impacted their year. Harry McKay missed half the season. Matthew Cottrell and Elijah Hollands, two of their best runners, hardly played, and heart-and-soul defender Nic Newman didn\u2019t get on the field at all.\n\nThen there\u2019s the prospect of a fit Jagga Smith. Get all them right and the Blues should be stronger \u2013 but this was a year when they fell well below expectations. Best and fairest tip: George Hewett.\n\n\u2013 Andrew Wu Melbourne (14th) Wins: 7. Losses: 16. Draft picks: 23, 51, 59* What went well: Kysaiah Pickett graduated from a star goalsneak to a game-breaking midfielder/forward who now rivals skipper Max Gawn as the club\u2019s best player. Despite their troubles, the Demons secured Pickett\u2019s prized signature in a huge coup, keeping him in the red and the blue until the end of 2034 on a lucrative contract.\n\nMidfielders Christian Petracca and Clayton Oliver are stars for Melbourne and both have long-term contracts, but that no longer means their respective futures at the club are guaranteed. Credit: Getty Images Gawn was again a colossus, talking through action on the field and becoming their spokesperson for almost every crisis off it. Rebounding defender Jake Bowey has taken the next step to become a driver of the team while Harvey Langford, the No.6 pick in last year\u2019s draft, is the Demons\u2019 next A-grade midfielder after making a seamless transition to senior football. Veteran forward Jake Melksham, with 33 goals from 18 games, earned himself another contract, which was confirmed by the Demons just days after their season ended.\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: Clayton Oliver and Christian Petracca. Do two of Melbourne\u2019s greatest players want to stay? If either player wants out, the club should not stand in their way. Coming back from a life-threatening injury, Petracca\u2019s season was steady, and he will likely finish in the top six of the club\u2019s best and fairest award, but a long way from his game-breaking ways. Loading\n\nOliver was better than last year when his campaign was compromised by his off-field issues. Both still have time to return to their best but the competition trend away from contest and stoppage towards speed and ball use is against them. Jacob van Rooyen went backwards in a season the club needed him to hold down a key forward posting. Something to look forward to: The appointment of a new coach always renews hope among the supporter base. Nathan Buckley is the early favourite but whoever succeeds Simon Goodwin must decide whether the core of this list can rise again after two years of diminishing returns or if it\u2019s time to invest more heavily in the next generation. In Harvey Langford, Xavier Lindsay and Caleb Windsor, the Dees have three highly talented young guns who will play a lot of football for the club.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So I'm here at the Red Cross Field Hospital in Rafah. I'm in our resuscitation area.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the past five weeks, Australian nurse Jean-Philippe Miller has been working in southern Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got our blood now so we can transfuse our patient. She's the young lady who's suffered a gunshot wound to her flank. She had damage to her spleen. She had damage to her lung collapsed and and blood in there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So we had to put a chest drain in - and drain out some of that blood. She remains with a high respiratory rate and high heart rate. It will give her this blood now. And it will help her stabilise her.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAn emergency nurse originally from Melbourne, Jean-Phillipe has spent the last decade deploying with the Red Cross to South Sudan, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Syria - now on his fourth rotation in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The hardest thing, the most distressing thing is seeing children who are injured. We've had children with gunshot wounds, with shrapnel injuries, with blast injuries. The children who have lost their parents. They're calling out for their their dead parents in our hospital. And you see how traumatised they are.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a hospital project in an active conflict zone we're a weapon-wounded hospital. We're seeing significant injuries here and yeah, I mean, it's confronting work.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Red Cross Field Hospital in Rafah opened in May last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was intended as a temporary facility, but is now one of the last fully functioning hospitals in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is is a hospital made of tents. We have seven wards. We have up to 100 patients. We were 110 when I first arrived. It's kind of a pre-packaged hospital that is normally designed to only operate for several months.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hospital is two kilometres from a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aid site.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd since it opened in May, the Red Cross has reported a surge in mass casualty incidents, saying 11 of 13 were linked to the aid distribution site.\n\n\n\n\n\nMedics say more than a third of patients were under 18.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd nearly half were women.\n\n\n\n\n\nJean Phillipe says he's attended mass casualty incidents of around 30 to 50 patients, but says his national colleagues have seen much larger events in the last few months.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The largest one was around 245 casualties arriving within a few hours. So it's near impossible to comprehend the chaos and the difficulty that that would be to treat all those patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Overall, as a whole, that the hospital has treated over 4,500 weapon wounded individuals; and logged 300 deaths of people that have been trying to access food.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hospital also constantly takes blood donations, often from the relatives of those injured, to provide lifesaving transfusions.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike every other medical facility in Gaza, the hospital operates with limited supplies.\n\n\n\n\n\nJean Phillipe explaining that the Red Cross provides colour-coded kits for first responders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So you've got red for critical patients, those with life-threatening injuries. Yellow for acute patients, green for the walking wounded, black for patients that have arrived deceased, and then you've got blue for those patients that have suffered unsurvivable injuries. And then it is more of a matter of making them comfortable and allowing them to die with some dignity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael's military offensive in Gaza City in the north is driving tens of thousands of Palestinians south.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of desperation. There's people who are trying to find places to evacuate to - and they're unable to.

The United Kingdom has a free trade agreement with Australia. That is really important. It is about Australian jobs. Our economic benefit we receive from that free trade agreement - from this engagement.

        "text": "Even his \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on all imports could be replaced by Section 232 versions, should the US Supreme Court uphold lower court judgements that they are illegal, although (a) the Supreme Court has a recent history of giving the administration what it asks for and (b) it would be far more time-consuming to use the section, which requires a particular and detailed investigatory process, and the administration would have to refund billions of dollars of tariff revenue in the meantime. Citing national security threats as a pretext for hitting imports of kitchen cabinets or furniture with his tariffs is clearly an artifice to enable Trump to build a wall against, it seems, almost all manufactured imports and the raw or semi-finished components to make them. It\u2019s also a way of maximising revenue for a government that is awash in deficits and debt. Next up in Trump\u2019s war on the world. The kitchen. Credit: istock Last year the US raised $US90 billion ($137.4 billion) from customs and excise duties. Recently, that revenue has been running at close to $US30 billion a month and it will keep rising as the most recently added tariffs (the reciprocal tariffs went live only last month) start to contribute.\n\nMost estimates of the tariffs are that they will generate around $US2.5 trillion over a decade, if they remain in place over that period. Loading They are of course, a particularly regressive tax on American consumers \u2013 they are paid for either by the US importer or are passed onto consumers via higher prices, with lower-income households hit hardest \u2013 despite Trump\u2019s continued assertions that foreign countries are paying them. The Yale Budget Lab says they will cost the equivalent of an average annual per-household loss of income of $US2400 in 2025 dollars, will lower US GDP growth by 0.4 per centage points in the long run and increase the unemployment rate by 0.7 percentage points next year. They will also impact the US inflation rate, indeed they are already are impacting it.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve Board\u2019s preferred measure of inflation is the core personal consumption expenditures index. On Friday the index, excluding volatile food and energy prices, showed a 0.3 percentage point increase in August relative to July. In July, then index rose 0.2 percentage points from June. The index is 2.9 per cent ahead of the same month last year. He\u2019s also foreshadowed national security tariffs on robotics, industrial machinery., semiconductors and medical devices and no doubt will come up with some other products deemed critical to America\u2019s security. In other words, prices and inflation are ticking up even before the full impact of the main tariffs \u2013 the baseline and reciprocal tariffs on the rest of the world \u2013 is felt. That\u2019s despite the fact that most of the tariffs\u2019 costs have, so far, been absorbed in the margins of US businesses rather than passed onto consumers.\n\nMany businesses also boosted their imports at pre-tariff prices significantly ahead of the well-flagged introduction of the main tariffs, allowing them to maintain pre-tariff pricing until their inventories have been depleted. There\u2019s no evidence that exporters to the US have lowered their prices to absorb any material proportion of the tariffs\u2019 costs. Loading Companies also wouldn\u2019t want to raise prices and lose sales while there is a possibility the Supreme Court will deem the tariffs illegal and force the revenue to be returned to importers. The full effects of the existing tariffs won\u2019t be seen for months and, with Trump regularly adding to the list of affected products, perhaps well into next year. While the impact on prices and inflation has been relatively muted to date, within the revised data released by the Commerce Department last week that showed robust 3.8 per cent growth in real GDP in the June quarter (after negative growth in the first quarter), business spending fell by an annualised 5.6 per cent in real terms. Business spending is being chilled by the uncertainties generated by Trump\u2019s trade wars and immigration policies.\n\nWith wages growth relatively flat, the overall growth in the economy appears to have been powered by consumption funded by households drawing on their savings, perhaps to get in ahead of the tariffs. That\u2019s not sustainable. The US has only days to avert another threat to growth, the shutting down of the US government if congressional Republicans and Democrats can\u2019t find a short-term compromise before the government\u2019s funding runs out on Wednesday, the start of America\u2019s new financial year. Trump, who had refused a request from Democrat leaders for a meeting, has changed his mind and will now discuss a short-term spending bill with them. US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. It\u2019s a thankless task being a central banker in Trump\u2019s America. Credit: Bloomberg The Democrats, while saying they want to avoid a shutdown, are insisting on an extension of health care subsidies and the restoration of cuts to health care spending in the administration\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, while Republicans want an extension of the funding before they will negotiate (if they will negotiate).",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size On a quiet street in Sydney\u2019s inner west, tucked in between warehouses, is an unassuming building where sounds of squeaking shoes on matte red floors and the echoing of balls ricocheting off bats fill the air. For years, the RTTC Table Tennis Academy in Rhodes has been Sydney\u2019s hotspot for nurturing world-class table tennis players, training more than 300 students each week. But that could all end after the state government\u2019s three-person Housing Delivery Authority recommended the fast-tracking of a proposal to build 2020 homes on the site. A Herald analysis of some of the largest HDA projects reveals a considerable gap in amenity \u2013 some of the proposed homes will be just a stone\u2019s throw away from shops, train stations, schools, and hospitals, while some residents will live up to 17 kilometres away from train stations and even further from schools, shops, or emergency departments. RTTC Table Tennis Academy on Averill Street in Rhodes, Sydney. Credit: James Brickwood The HDA\u2019s recommendations bypass local councils, which accelerates development approval times for major residential developments above $60 million in metropolitan areas and $30 million in regional NSW. Since February, more than 91,100 potential homes have been declared state significant under the HDA pathway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRhodes If it goes ahead, the development will mean the table tennis academy on Averill Street will have to shut its doors so the building can be demolished to make way for 2020 apartments, resulting in a loss of public amenity in an already densely populated suburb. It has become a second home for 15-year-old Daisy Xie, who for the past five years has attended at least four times a week. Xie said closure of the centre that was a perfect in-between meeting point for her and her playing partner would upend their training. \u201cIt\u2019s already difficult to find a training partner that suits you. Besides, this venue is so good \u2013 if we have to move elsewhere it will disrupt training and make things a lot more inconvenient,\u201d she said. \u201cThe centre has flat, even grounds, so the ball won\u2019t roll around. It\u2019s also well lit and has air conditioning. It will be difficult to find a location just as suitable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClub manager Jecie Yao said it signed a 10-year lease with the landlord in 2023. But the uncertain future of the centre means it could be asked at any point to close up and relocate, which would present countless logistical nightmares. \u201cWe hope it\u2019s not happening, but I know eventually it will happen. It\u2019s pretty tough when a business has to relocate. We\u2019ll have to do the marketing and start from scratch,\u201d Yao said. Rhodes has no schools, and the proposed development is a 12-minute walk to Rhodes station. Marsden Park In between a permanently shuttered laboratory and an expanse of overgrown fields, is a package of empty land in Marsden Park that could have 800 homes. The proposed greenfield development at 264A South Street is 4.3 kilometres from Schofields train station, 2.2km from the nearest grocery store, and almost 6.8 km away from the closest primary school and high school. The closest hospital with an emergency department is 6.7km away, in Mount Druitt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRichmond Road is also the only major road in \u2013 or out \u2013 of Marsden Park, meaning the already congested corridor could buckle under pressure from more residents moving in. Located 50km north-west of the CBD, Marsden Park is a relatively new suburb known for its sprawling small-lot, dark-roofed large houses that have become synonymous with homogenous new-build homes on Sydney\u2019s periphery. Marsden Park is far from basic amenities. Credit: Rhett Wyman The population has boomed in these greenfield suburbs. Marsden Park and its neighbouring suburb Shanes Park added nearly 18,000 people between 2019 and 2023, bringing its total population to 23,778. Experts have previously flagged issues with these fringe suburbs, such as rising heat, poor transport links, minimal recreational space, and the absence of essential amenities. Appin\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe largest development recommended by the HDA comprises 2499 homes in Appin, 71km south-west of Sydney on the road between Wollongong and Campbelltown. While Appin sits within the Greater Macarthur growth area, and is a key plank in the state\u2019s plan to build 377,000 homes by 2029, amenities and infrastructure are few and far between for its 3500 residents. The closest hospital in Campbelltown is more than an 18-kilometre drive away, and Douglas Park, the nearest train station is almost 17 kilometres from the proposed site. While there is a long-term vision for nearly 16,000 new homes in Appin, a cap of 2499 homes has been put in place, and will only increase when wastewater and infrastructure such as roads and sewage systems are delivered first by Transport for NSW and Sydney Water. Draft plans from the developer include three new local centres with shops and services, new transport corridors and road upgrades, three new school sites, and sites for emergency service facilities.

        "text": "The Magpies, however, may tell Mihocek they won\u2019t budge from their two-year offer. Mason Cox, 34, faces an uncertain future, while Dan Houston \u2013 and the Pies \u2013 will agree they need more from him next season. Bobby Hill, having missed so much football because of personal issues, remains a close watch. Something to look forward to: Houston was not the same counter-puncher he was at Port Adelaide in his first year with the Magpies \u2013 expect that to change next year. He is exemplary with ball in hand, and needs to have more of it. Skipper Darcy Moore had an indifferent season, and may need to revisit the balance between pure defending and hunting the ball. Get that right, and the Magpies \u2013 already built on defence \u2013 will be even stronger. Coach Craig McRae wants a blend of good draft picks and established players through this trade/draft period. They missed out on Jack Silvagni, but will trade for Swans\u2019 forward Jack Buller.\n\nAnother established defender may be front of mind, for Jeremy Howe, 35, is showing signs of wear and tear. Predicted best and fairest: Nick Daicos.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Adelaide (fifth after finals loss)\n\nWins: 18 Losses: 7 Draft picks: 18, 41, 48, 54, 66, 72. What went well: There was much to like. The Crows not only leapt back into the finals for the first time since 2017, but won 12 of their final 13 home-and-away games to finish as minor premier. Matthews Nicks\u2019 game plan, essentially built on going long down the line, held up during the season proper. Taylor Walker may not like what he hears from the Crows\u2019 bosses in his end-of-season meeting. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images Skipper Jordan Dawson and full-forward Riley Thilthorpe were All-Australians, while fellow forwards Taylor Walker and Darcy Fogarty, and forward-midfielder Ben Keays, also enjoyed strong home-and-away seasons. Former Demon Alex Neal-Bullen was a fine acquisition, and could be a future skipper.\n\nIzak Rankine provided creativity up field and close to goal, and was badly missed through suspension for a homophobic slur in September. \u201cWhat it did do was it changed the dynamic of our group,\u201d Nicks said of Rankine\u2019s absence. \u201cIzak is, and this is my opinion, one of the best players in the game, so I think if any team loses their best player, then it becomes quite challenging to replace that.\u201d It could be a rough exit meeting for: Taylor Walker. The champion forward, 35, is off contract, and his time may be up after a modest finals campaign. The Crows may feel Thilthorpe and Fogarty need to be empowered and shoulder greater responsibility. Fellow veteran Brodie Smith, 33, is also weighing up his future. Something to look forward to: This was a year when the Crows built a foundation for what should be a five-year premiership tilt. Yes, they failed to win a quarter in their two finals defeats, becoming the first minor premiers in more than 40 years to be dumped from September in straight sets, but that sting should fire this squad. However, they do have holes. While unbeaten in 13 games against bottom nine teams, they were 6-7 against top nine teams, their scoring and defence dropping off.\n\nThey need another X-factor in addition to Rankine, while a forward line of three talls didn\u2019t hold-up in September, when the ball is on the ground more. Another strong defender would also help. Nicks will need to tinker with his game plan. As he said after the semi-final loss to Hawthorn, it\u2019s harder to move the ball the way you want in the finals when the intensity rises. The Crows have been linked with off-contract Lions forward Callum Ah Chee.\n\nBest and fairest tip: Jordan Dawson.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Suns gun Matt Rowell takes a physical battering in every game he plays. Credit: Getty Images Gold Coast (sixth after finals loss)\n\nWins: 16 Losses: 9 Draft picks 6, 14, 15, 32, 56, 68 What went well: The Suns have finally risen. This was a breakthrough season for a club, which not only made its maiden finals run in its 15th attempt, but conjured a miraculous win over the Dockers in Perth. Skipper Noah Anderson and fellow midfielder Matt Rowell were first-time All-Australians, their sustained efforts in the midfield a sight to behold. The physical punishment Rowell takes reminds us of the hits an NFL running back endures. Marking forward Ben King was superb in front of goal but will need to add a new trick or two. Fellow forward Ben Long had a breakout campaign, although he was disappointing in the semi-final, while recruits Daniel Rioli and John Noble delivered what was expected of them at half-back.\n\nSam Collins is a beast at full-back, Touk Miller delivered run and carry, while Bailey Humphrey showed signs of morphing into the Suns\u2019 version of Cam Rayner. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Jed Walter. The young forward was dropped after round 19 and did not return to the side. While the former Suns academy product is contracted for next season, he could be used in a trade for Carlton\u2019s Charlie Curnow. While a star in the making, Mac Andrew will face a strong review of his finals performances. Something to look forward to: There is plenty to look forward to with this emerging list, coach Damien Hardwick declaring his team is built for September. The base is there, it\u2019s now time to build internally and through canny trades. The Suns were too reliant on Rowell and Anderson, and need another robust midfielder who can deliver under pressure. The unicorn that is Ethan Read struggled in the semi-final but has the height and talent to be a long-term marking threat. They could lose Sam Flanders, who has two years remaining on his contract, and Malcolm Rosas, through the trade period.\n\nBest and fairest tip: Noah Anderson.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Fremantle (8th) Wins: 16. Losses: 8. Draft picks 13, 31, 38, 49, 67. What went well: After last year\u2019s meltdown, when they slipped from the top eight at the start of August to 10th by the end, the Dockers held firm this year and returned to the finals for the first time since 2022, winning 12 of their last 14 games to finish sixth. Caleb Serong again starred in the Fremantle midfield. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nThey adopted a more attacking gameplan after five losses from their first nine games, but failed to fully embrace this mantra in a stinging elimination final defeat to the Suns. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown so much throughout the year with the way we play our footy, the way we embrace challenges, the way we\u2019ve improved our footy on the road,\u201d coach Justin Longmuir said after the loss to the Suns. Marking talls Josh Treacy (44 goals) and Patrick Voss (37) had strong seasons, while Murphy Reid claimed the AFLPA\u2019s best young player award. Former premiership Tiger Shai Bolton (28) was arguably the recruit of the year. Defender Jordan Clark and midfield stud Caleb Serong were All-Australians, while Andrew Brayshaw was unlucky not to be.\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: Jye Amiss. While he played all 24 games, Amiss, a key marking tall, returned a modest 32 goals, and averaged career-lows in marks and disposals per game. He had only two touches (one goal) in the elimination final before being subbed off. Amiss could be a trade target. Then there\u2019s ruckman Sean Darcy. Will he and Luke Jackson continue to be a one-two punch in the ruck? We\u2019ll see. Something to look forward to: The Dockers are building nicely. They had an average age of just 24.9 years through the season \u2013 the fourth youngest in the competition. Fremantle ruckman Sean Darcy. Credit: AFL Photos AFL great James Hird has set high expectations for them next year, despite their loss to the Suns on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI think they have to be top four next year with their list and the way they\u2019ve had the final this year and the performances against the best teams in the competition. I\u2019ve really gotten locked in that top four next year,\u201d Hird said. But they cannot afford to have lulls and slip back into a defensive mindset when the pressure is at its greatest. This will be Longmuir\u2019s greatest challenge. Best and fairest: Caleb Serong.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik GWS (7th)\n\nWins: 16. Losses: 8. Draft picks: 12, 30, 36. What went well: After a dodgy first half of the year, the Giants won nine of their last 10 home-and-away games, scoring more than 100 points in each of them. In the end, they finished with one of the AFL\u2019s best attacking records, just two points behind third place. Toby Greene and his Giants were eliminated at home by the Hawks. Credit: AFL Photos At their best, they were absolutely awe-inspiring: their stunning third quarters against the Swans in the second Sydney derby of the season, plus their (eventually unsuccessful) comeback against Hawthorn in their elimination final, will live long in the memory. The challenge will be closing the gap between their frightening best and their timid worst. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Everyone. The Giants have now lost their past four finals, including two at home (and three in Sydney) \u2013 the sort of record that each player needs to take a varying degree of responsibility for, as well as the coaching group, and will require them all to look deeply within over the summer. September stumbles are becoming too much of a theme.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that they concede too many entries, which can\u2019t be wholly pinned on the six poor blokes in defence who had to deal with that avalanche. All things considered, they managed OK, but it felt unsustainable, and so it has proved. And there\u2019s a similar problem going the other way. When they\u2019re on, they\u2019re on, but the Giants\u2019 attack falls to pieces when they mindlessly blaze away inside 50 as they did against Hawthorn, which completely undermines their forward set-up. Composure in key moments is lacking in this side across every line, and that\u2019s not an easy thing to add. Sam Taylor is a star defender for GWS, but the Giants\u2019 defensive unit is under pressure. Credit: AFL Photos Something to look forward to: As Adam Kingsley said post-match, the Giants still have \u201call the pieces\u201d to contend, although their ageing stars are running out of petrol. But the window remains open, their next tier of rising stars will be better with another season under their belts and if they can address their inconsistencies, get to the psychological nub of their finals failures and have some better luck with injuries, there\u2019s no reason why they won\u2019t be back contending again in 2026. Best and fairest tip: Finn Callaghan showed exactly why St Kilda threw a $17 million, 10-year contract offer at him; thank heavens he said no. He and Tom Green (likely second in the best and fairest) run this team now.\n\n\u2013 Vince Rugari\n\nWestern Bulldogs (9th) Wins: 14. Losses: 9. Draft picks: 10, 28 What went well: Offensive power. The Doggies poured on the goals this season, scoring more points (2493) than any other team. Led by Marcus Bontempelli, Tom Liberatore, Ed Richards and an increasingly influential Sam Darcy up forward, they beat up teams with regularity. While that resulted in a 14-9 record, the team from the west missed the finals. The Bulldogs were an offensive juggernaut in 2025 but still missed finals. Credit: Getty Images\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: Jamarra Ugle-Hagan. The one-time No.1 draft pick has occupied so much of the Bulldogs top brass\u2019 time this season. It would be fascinating to witness his official exit meeting given there\u2019s so much to discuss for a player who didn\u2019t add to his tally of 67 AFL games this season. Defenders will be in the spotlight, too, but each player on the list will be pressed for explanations as to why the Dogs simply couldn\u2019t beat teams who were vying for finals spots. Something to look forward to: Plenty, to be truthful. The Dogs have recorded 14 wins in consecutive seasons; in 2024 they played finals, so they can\u2019t wallow in pity about what happened this year. Jamarra Ugle-Hagan didn\u2019t play a game for the Bulldogs this season. Credit: Justin McManus Darcy, at age 22, remains one of the most exciting young players in the game. Aaron Naughton\u2019s best season (65 goals) is a beacon of hope for even better things, too.\n\nBest and fairest tip: I\u2019ve landed on Ed Richards ahead of Tom Liberatore. Bontempelli\u2019s missed games through injury will cost him.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits Port Adelaide (13th) Wins: 8. Losses: 15. Draft picks: 26, 42, 60 What went well: That\u2019s tough to answer because this was an extremely disappointing year, despite Ken Hinkley\u2019s protestations the list is set up well for 2026. Port Adelaide chairman David Koch stuck with Ken Hinkley to the end. Credit: Getty Images\n\nHaving made a preliminary final last year, the Power slipped markedly. However, skipper Connor Rozee and fellow star midfielder Zak Butters were typically industrious, while forward Mitch Georgiades delivered a half-century of goals for the first time. Aliir Aliir enjoyed another stellar season in defence, while Travis Boak and Hinkley were given a classy send-off against the Suns, the victory fully deserved. Zak Butters won Port Adelaide\u2019s best and fairest award - the John Cahill Medal - for the third consecutive year in 2025. Credit: Getty Images It could be a rough exit meeting for: President David Koch and his board. The succession plan designed to ease Hinkley out and Josh Carr to prepare for the senior role next season was done with the best of intentions, but the scoreboard says it was a failure. If Hinkley wasn\u2019t the man to take the team forward, then Carr should have been immediately installed, and Hinkley given a thank-you payout for his years of fine service.\n\nSomething to look forward to: The Power should be back in the finals hunt next year, but they will need to get busy in the trade period. Do they have enough true stars? Missing out on Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera will hurt. Late season injuries have given the youngsters a chance. We like what we have seen of Jack Whitlock, who can play ruck and go forward. Best and fairest winner: Zak Butters.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Essendon (15th)\n\n\n\nWins: 6. Losses: 17. Draft picks: 4, 5, 22, 25. What went well: The Bombers have some superb youngsters. In his second year, Nate Caddy again gave glimpses of the player he could become, with 20 goals and more flashes of brilliance. Isaac Kako gave Bombers fans something to get excited about. Credit: AFL Photos Isaac Kako impressed with his smarts around goals and showed late in the season he can also be developed as a pinch-hitter in the centre square. Archie Roberts, the lowest draft pick of the trio, could end up being a steal. The teenager is advanced beyond his years, demonstrating composure and skill in a defence that was under siege.\n\nAngus Clarke is another of the club\u2019s 15 debutants this year who has provided Bombers fans with hope in a wretched campaign. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Ben Hobbs. In his fourth season, Hobbs, 21, failed to take a more significant role in the side. Worryingly for Hobbs, despite Essendon\u2019s litany of injuries, he was dropped for the first leg of the final round and could not break back into the team. Hobbs has stagnated in his past two seasons, reaching 20 disposals in just three of his past 30 games. His disposal remains a worry. If time has run out for the first-round pick from the 2021 draft, it would raise further queries on the Bombers\u2019 recruiting and player development. Something to look forward to: The draft. The Bombers have a strong hand in this year\u2019s draft after acquiring Melbourne\u2019s first selection through a pick swap last year. Even accounting for father/son, academy and NGA picks, the Bombers should have access to two very good youngsters.\n\nIf Sam Draper departs through free agency, that should deliver another first-round pick. Unfortunately for the Dons, this is not considered the strongest draft, but one experienced recruiter has said they would not be surprised if smokies emerge deeper in the pool. Best and fairest: Zach Merrett.\n\n\u2013 Andrew Wu West Coast (18th) Wins: 1. Losses: 22. Draft picks: 1, 14, 19, 32, 50.\n\nWhat went well: Sorry West Coast fans, this is not pretty. The Eagles have managed 11 wins in four seasons, including just one victory, over St Kilda, in a torturous 2025 season. But there\u2019s always a glimmer of hope and performances and players to celebrate. Two-time Richmond premiership player Jack Graham, who joined the Eagles for 2025, comfortably exceeded his career average for disposals (19.2 possessions per game this season) and had 7.8 tackles per game (which is considered \u201celite\u201d). It could be a rough exit meeting for: The defensive unit and the defence coaches. West Coast comfortably conceded the highest number of points (2438) this season, leaving them with a limp percentage of 60.1. If premierships are built from the backline, they need to focus there.\n\nIt will be fascinating to see the club\u2019s attitude towards Tim Kelly, who played 19 games in his sixth season with the Eagles. Something to look forward to: It couldn\u2019t get any worse, could it? If West Coast haven\u2019t bottomed out, where is the bottom? The Eagles can expect the No.2 draft pick as compensation for losing free agent Oscar Allen to Brisbane, so that\u2019s something. And Harley Reid is staying for now, having resisted interest from big Victorian clubs to extend until the end of 2028. Eagles fans can only look forward to better times ahead. Best and fairest tip: Jack Graham.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits\n\nNorth Melbourne (16th) Wins: 5 Losses: 17 Draws: 1 Draft picks: 20, 21, 39, 57 What went well: They made it out of the bottom two! The Kangaroos and coach Alastair Clarkson would have liked to see more progress on the ladder, but he remains bullish they are heading in the right direction. North Melbourne avoided another bottom-two finish. Credit: Getty Images\n\nAfter a torrid first six rounds and the odd thrashing beyond that, North were generally more competitive, including securing a draw with Brisbane, but there were no statement wins. Instead, they would be pleased with Harry Sheezel\u2019s transition to a midfield-forward role, the continued development of Colby McKercher and career-best seasons from Cam Zurhaar and Paul Curtis. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Will Phillips. The No.3 pick in the COVID-19-impacted 2020 draft class played only seven matches this season and does not appear to be in the Roos\u2019 plans. He should latch on somewhere, but needs to get going to save his career. Something to look forward to: Next year promises to be the season when North Melbourne finally take a genuine leap. How high that is remains to be seen, but the expectations must rise, even if that is as modest as aiming for between eight and 10 wins.\n\nThe young talent is there, and they may have finally found Nick Larkey\u2019s sidekick in Cooper Trembath. A stiffer defence and another progression from their midfield group should enable them to take another belated step. Best and fairest: Luke Davies-Uniacke.\n\n\u2013 Marc McGowan Richmond (17th)\n\nWins: 5. Losses: 18. Draft picks: 2,3 What went well: Plenty for a club that was widely tipped to sail through turbulent waters with a drastically young and inexperienced list. The season began on the best note possible with a stunning round-one win over Carlton. The nature of the victory, a come-from-behind triumph, set the tone for the season for both the Tigers and Blues. Throw in highlights from Maurice Rioli jnr, and all was swell. Tim Taranto had a strong season as one of the Tigers\u2019 on-field leaders. Credit: AFL Photos It could be a rough exit meeting for: The club\u2019s forwards and the forward coaches. The Tigers scored the fewest number of points (1449), less even than West Coast, a club that limped to one victory, compared to Richmond\u2019s five.\n\nVeteran spearhead Tom Lynch could cop a drive-by sledge for missing games. He played only 16 matches (due largely to a suspension) after a tough couple of years with injuries. Something to look forward to: There\u2019s so much to look forward to. Realistically, the Tigers will battle to replicate their win-loss tally (5-18) as they continue to develop their young group. It could be a case of the \u201csecond-year blues\u201d for a host of players. But Richmond will be eyeing off their matches against Carlton and the chance to knock them off again.\n\nBest and fairest tip: Tim Taranto.\n\n\u2013 Scott Spits St Kilda (12th) Wins: 9. Losses: 14. Draft picks: 7, 43, 58. What went well: The Saints were a popular choice to sink into the bottom four, but finished three wins clear of that territory while prioritising youth. The Saints will welcome Tom De Koning in 2026 and welcome back Max King after another injury-riddled season. Credit: AFL Photos\n\nSt Kilda\u2019s round two upset of Geelong was a false dawn, but a peek at their upside. They also demolished Fremantle and executed the greatest three-quarter-time comeback from 46 points down against Melbourne. That latter win was the first of four in a row before they almost upset GWS in round 24. Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera\u2019s emergence as a top-liner was massive, while Max Hall followed Cooper Sharman and Max Heath as a mid-season draft success story. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Zak Jones. The brother of ex-Demons captain Nathan was not one of the five Saints who re-signed last week, and faces an uncertain future. Jones turns 31 in March, and St Kilda already made it clear they want to get younger in the midfield.\n\nSomething to look forward to: Another two years from Wanganeen-Milera, who they retained despite Adelaide and Port Adelaide wanting him. There is optimism about what Mattaes Phillipou, Darcy Wilson, Alix Tauru and Tobie Travaglia can become, while the likes of Hugo Garcia, Isaac Keeler, Hugh Boxshall and Lance Collard also show promise. Tom De Koning will be on the list in 2026, and Max King will hopefully be fit again. Best and fairest tip: Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera.\n\n\u2013 Marc McGowan Sydney (10th)\n\nWins: 12. Losses: 11. Draft picks: 9, 27, 45, 63. What went well: Having won just four of their first 12 games under new coach Dean Cox, the Swans showed fortitude to rebound and win eight of their final 11 games. Brodie Grundy returned to his best form for Sydney in 2025. Credit: AFL Photos Playmaker Isaac Heeney had a tough start, but then reminded everyone why he is a legitimate star. Chad Warner was a consistent threat through the midfield, but did not have the impact he enjoyed through 2022-24.\n\nA serious ankle injury through the pre-season sidelined Errol Gulden for months and seriously hurt the Swans\u2019 midfield and creative drive, just as his return in round 15 had the reverse effect. Brodie Grundy reinforced why he is one of the competition\u2019s premier ruckmen. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Skipper Callum Mills. For the Swans to make the leap next season, Mills needs to consistently be on the park. His 2024 campaign was derailed after injuring his rotator cuff in a Mad Monday celebration. He missed the first half of this year because of plantar fascia. He needs to lead the way in 2026. Something to look forward to: This has been a year of recalibration for the Swans, and learning, particularly for Cox, who is now more at ease in the top role after replacing John Longmire.\n\nWhile it feels somewhat of a wasted year, the Swans are still in top-four mode, and are likely to be strengthened through the trade period. They just need to get moving earlier next season. Best and fairest tip: Isaac Heeney.\n\n\u2013 Jon Pierik Carlton (11th) Wins: 9. Losses: 14. Draft picks: 34, 44, 62*. What went well: Not much. George Hewett was one of few Blues to exceed expectations, putting together a career-best season in the midfield.\n\nJack Silvagni and Tom De Koning are both leaving the Blues. Credit: Getty Images Better known as a defensive onballer, Hewett became a prolific ball-winner in his own right. In his 12th season on an AFL list, the former Swan is a strong chance to win his first best and fairest award. Veteran Nick Haynes overcame a horror start at the club to become dependable defender. He deserves another year. Young midfielder Cooper Lord is one to watch. George Hewett stepped up for the Blues in 2025, but didn\u2019t get enough support. Credit: Getty Images The Blues blooded seven debutants, the best of whom looks to be key defender Harry O\u2019Farrell, who, unfortunately, injured his knee.\n\nOther gains were bitter-sweet. Jack Silvagni was a revelation in defence but played just 13 games and is now on the move. Ollie Hollands found plenty of the ball in his new role as a running defender but his kicking needs work. It could be a rough exit meeting for: Mitch McGovern. The Blues are keen to get money off their books and the writing is on the wall for the 30-year-old, who narrowly missed a games trigger that would have earned a contract extension. With Silvagni walking out and O\u2019Farrell to be unsighted for much of 2026, the defender may yet get another year, but it will be on the Blues\u2019 terms. Veterans Adam Saad and Blake Acres both had ordinary seasons. Something to look forward to: With mass change underway in the coaches box, free agents Tom De Koning and Silvagni confirming their departures, and ongoing chatter about Charlie Curnow, it\u2019s already been a turbulent off-season for the Blues, and the AFL home and away season isn\u2019t even officially over yet! Expect that turmoil to continue for some time yet.\n\nBut once they ride that out, there will be hope again. The departures of De Koning and Silvagni will strengthen the Blues\u2019 draft hand to acquire highly-rated Harry Dean as a father-son pick. Decimated by injury in 2025, the Blues can vault back into finals contention with a cleaner bill of health. Curnow (assuming he stays) and Sam Walsh had interrupted preseasons which severely impacted their year. Harry McKay missed half the season. Matthew Cottrell and Elijah Hollands, two of their best runners, hardly played, and heart-and-soul defender Nic Newman didn\u2019t get on the field at all.\n\nThen there\u2019s the prospect of a fit Jagga Smith. Get all them right and the Blues should be stronger \u2013 but this was a year when they fell well below expectations. Best and fairest tip: George Hewett.\n\n\u2013 Andrew Wu Melbourne (14th) Wins: 7. Losses: 16. Draft picks: 23, 51, 59* What went well: Kysaiah Pickett graduated from a star goalsneak to a game-breaking midfielder/forward who now rivals skipper Max Gawn as the club\u2019s best player. Despite their troubles, the Demons secured Pickett\u2019s prized signature in a huge coup, keeping him in the red and the blue until the end of 2034 on a lucrative contract.\n\nMidfielders Christian Petracca and Clayton Oliver are stars for Melbourne and both have long-term contracts, but that no longer means their respective futures at the club are guaranteed. Credit: Getty Images Gawn was again a colossus, talking through action on the field and becoming their spokesperson for almost every crisis off it. Rebounding defender Jake Bowey has taken the next step to become a driver of the team while Harvey Langford, the No.6 pick in last year\u2019s draft, is the Demons\u2019 next A-grade midfielder after making a seamless transition to senior football. Veteran forward Jake Melksham, with 33 goals from 18 games, earned himself another contract, which was confirmed by the Demons just days after their season ended.\n\nIt could be a rough exit meeting for: Clayton Oliver and Christian Petracca. Do two of Melbourne\u2019s greatest players want to stay? If either player wants out, the club should not stand in their way. Coming back from a life-threatening injury, Petracca\u2019s season was steady, and he will likely finish in the top six of the club\u2019s best and fairest award, but a long way from his game-breaking ways. Loading\n\nOliver was better than last year when his campaign was compromised by his off-field issues. Both still have time to return to their best but the competition trend away from contest and stoppage towards speed and ball use is against them. Jacob van Rooyen went backwards in a season the club needed him to hold down a key forward posting. Something to look forward to: The appointment of a new coach always renews hope among the supporter base. Nathan Buckley is the early favourite but whoever succeeds Simon Goodwin must decide whether the core of this list can rise again after two years of diminishing returns or if it\u2019s time to invest more heavily in the next generation. In Harvey Langford, Xavier Lindsay and Caleb Windsor, the Dees have three highly talented young guns who will play a lot of football for the club.",
