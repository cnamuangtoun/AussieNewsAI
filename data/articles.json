        "text": "As Australia rings in the new year today, a host of changes will come into effect.\n\nThe changes aim to save Australians money, prevent price increases and improve public health responses.\n\nFrom a new cash mandate to cheaper medicines and welfare payment rises, here are the main changes coming into effect in 2026.\n\nAs Australia welcomes a new year, the nation will also welcome some changes. (Getty)\n\nWelfare payments rise\n\nMore than a million Australians are set to receive an increase to their payments from today .\n\nThe changes will apply to those receiving \ufeffyouth allowance, Austudy, ABSTUDY, youth disability pension and carer allowance payments.\n\nThe amount will differ depending on your circumstances.\n\nA full list of the changes is available on the Department of Social Services website.\ufeff\n\nBusinesses must take cash\ufeff\n\nThis year Treasurer Jim Chalmers\ufeff announced that Australia would introduce a cash mandate for grocery and fuel retailers from today.\n\nUnder the new rules, \ufeffbusinesses that sell fuel and groceries must accept cash payments for these essential purchases.\n\nThe mandate will mostly apply to retailers such as supermarkets and service stations.\n\nAustralia will introduce a cash mandate for grocery and fuel retailers from January 1. (iStock)\n\nCheaper medicines through the PBS \ufeff\n\nAustralians can expect their medicine bills to be slashed in the new year.\n\nThe general patient co-payment for medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) will be capped at $25 per script from January 1 , a decrease from $31.60.\n\nThe change is a key election promise from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and is coming through with bipartisan support from the Coalition.\n\nMedicare safety net increases\n\nThe Medicare safety net will rise today, pushing up the amount Australians and their families will need to pay before they are provided with increased public health subsidies.\n\nThe original safety net is increasing from $576 to $594, while the extended safety net has gone from $834 to $861 for concession card holders and from $2615 to $2699 for those without concession cards.\n\nThe Medicare safety net will rise on January 1. (Justin McManus/The Age)\n\nDental costs\n\nA trip to the dentist can be costly but there will be some additional support for some Australians. \ufeff\n\nThe child dental benefits schedule will cover $1158 every two years for eligible families from today, an increase of $26.\n\nThe government program was set up to cover part or all of the cost of basic dental services for eligible children aged 17 or under .\n\nChildcare subsidy change \ufeff\n\nFamilies who are eligible for the childcare subsidy will get at least 72 hours of subsidised childcare per fortnight regardless of how much they work.\n\nMeanwhile families can get 100 hours if they work more than 48 hours a week.\ufeff\n\nThe changes will come into effect on January 5, 2026.\ufeff\n\nACCC merger laws\n\nAustralia's merger laws will undergo a significant overhaul today, aimed at preventing anti-competitive price rises for consumers and industry concentration.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the federal government will make it mandatory for businesses to notify the ACCC about certain acquisitions and receive subsequent approval from the regulator.\n\nA merger deal between businesses must be reported to the ACCC if it meets certain requirements, including where the companies involved have a combined Australian turnover of $200 million or more.\n\nThe previous system \ufeffwas voluntary and informal.\n\nEnergy bill discount ends\n\nTreasurer J\ufeffim Chalmers has confirmed the federal government's energy bill discount will end in the new year.\n\nThe much-needed $300 power bill relief was \ufeffoffered to households during the 2024-25 financial year, aimed at curbing cost of living pain for Australian families.\n\nAn extra $150 subsidy was then offered to Australians from July, however Chalmers revealed it would not be extended beyond December 31, 2025.\n\nTreasurer J\ufeffim Chalmers has confirmed the federal government's energy bill discount will end in the new year. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nCentre for Disease Control launch\n\nAustralia will establish a \ufeffpermanent Centre for Disease Control (CDC) from today to help the nation prepare for and prevent public health emergencies.\n\nThe opening comes almost 40 years after the first calls for the country to establish the service .\n\nThe Public Health Association of Australia (PHAA) called it the \"most important piece of public health infrastructure in generations\", and Health Minister Mark Butler said the CDC would \"help protect Australia from diseases and public health threats\".\n\nPassport price change\ufeff\n\nIf you need to renew your passport, you will be paying more in the new year.\n\nPassport prices are set to increase increase in line with inflation.\n\nThe cost of a 10-year adult passport is currently $412, which means the price could rise to $422 in 2026.\n\nNSW toll cap to be made permanent\n\nIf you live in NSW and regularly drive on toll roads, you could save some money on your commute in the new year.\n\n\ufeffNSW Premier Chris Minns confirmed in November the state's $60-a-week toll cap would continue beyond January 1, 2026 to help motorists with the cost-of-living.\n\nThe rebate allows \ufeffmotorists to claim up to $340 back a week after spending $60 per vehicle.\n\nHowever he \ufeffwarned there could be a major change to how the Sydney Harbour Bridge is tolled to pay for the relief.\n\nMinns also announced the trial demerit point reward program would be made permanent in the new year.\n\nThis means unrestricted licence holders who incur no traffic infringements for a full calendar year will have one demerit point removed from their licence.\n\nVictorian public transport changes\n\nFrom today, metro public transport fares in Victoria will rise.\n\nThis includes the daily fare cap which will increase from $11 to $11.40 on weekdays and from $7.60 to $8 on weekends.\n\nPeople under 18 with a youth Myki card can travel free of charge in the new year, while concession card holders can travel for free on weekends.\ufeff",

(A Current Affair)\n\nArmstrong now does a yearly pantry re-stock and smaller fresh food shops every few weeks.\n\nThe annual shop costs about $1200 and consists of enough staples for her family for the year.\n\n\"All I simply did was look back over what I'd been buying and multiplied everything so it equaled a year's worth,\" she said.\n\nArmstrong finds her calculations are \"pretty accurate\", which helps her avoid food waste.\n\nDuring the yearly shop, she buys mostly generic brands from Aldi, Coles and Woolworths.\n\n\"It doesn't take up a lot of space, I've got one shelf unit in my laundry and that's about it,\" she said.\n\nREAD MORE: Cash boost for more than a million Australians\n\nArmstrong's grocery shopping method allows her to cut down on trips to the supermarket.

        "text": "An Australian meat industry peak body says China's move to impose an added 55 per cent tariff on beef imports that exceed quota levels from several countries including Australia will have a \"severe impact\" and that it is \"extremely disappointed\".\n\nChina's commerce ministry on Wednesday explained the tariffs, also impacting Brazil and the United States, were designed to protect a domestic cattle industry slowly emerging from oversupply.\n\nAustralia exported more than 295,000 tons of beef to China in the first 11 months of 2025 and the Australian Meat Industry Council said the new tariff would cut those exports by a third, costing the Australian industry about $1 billion.\n\nRecord April for Aussie beef exports Despite global uncertainty, tariffs, Trump and trade wars, demand for Australian beef is breaking records.\n\nChina's commerce ministry said the total import quota for 2026 for countries covered under its new \"safeguard measures\" is 2.7 million metric tons, roughly in line with the record 2.87 million tons it imported overall in 2024.\n\nThe new annual quota levels are set below import levels for the first 11 months of 2025 for top supplier Brazil, as well as for Australia.\n\n\"The increase in the amount of imported beef has seriously damaged China's domestic industry,\" the ministry said, as it announced the measures following an investigation launched last December.\n\nThe ministry also said it was suspending part of a free trade agreement with Australia covering beef.\n\n\"The implementation of safeguards on imported beef is intended to temporarily help the domestic industry get through difficulties, not to restrict normal beef trade,\" a spokesperson said in a separate statement.\n\nThe measures take effect from January 1, 2026 for three years, with the total quota increasing annually.\n\nTariffs to have 'severe impact': industry body\n\nThe Australian Meat Industry Council (AMIC) chief executive Tim Ryan said the new trade arrangements were restrictive and \"not fair, appropriate, or reflective of the long-standing, mutually beneficial trade relationship Australia has with China\".\n\n\"This decision appears to reward other countries who have surged the volume of beef exported to the Chinese market in recent years,\" Mr Ryan said.\n\n\"This decision will have a severe impact on trade flows to China over the duration of the measures' enforcement, disrupt the longstanding relationships fostered under the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, and restrict the ability for Chinese consumers to access safe and reliable Australian beef,\" he said.\n\nAustralia faces a quota of about 200,000 tons and the United States one of 164,000 tons.\n\nFor 2026, Brazil has an import quota of 1.1 million tons while Argentina has a cap of roughly half that.\n\nChina is an important market for Australian beef. (ABC Rural: Annie Brown)\n\nBeef imports to China fell 0.3 per cent in the first 11 months of 2025, to 2.59 million tons, according to China's minstry.\n\nChinese beef imports will decline in 2026 as a result of the measures, said Hongzhi Xu, senior analyst at Beijing Orient Agribusiness Consultants.\n\nInvestigators in China found that beef imports had damaged China's domestic industry, Beijing's commerce ministry said in a statement. The probe covered fresh, frozen, bone-in and boneless beef.\n\nCountries have been assigned annual quotas and beef sent to China will be subject to the extra 55 per cent levy if imports go beyond that amount.\n\nTrump's beef with Brazil Donald Trump is threatening a 50 per cent tariff on Brazil, which is a major supplier of beef, coffee and orange juice to the US.\n\nThe Australian Meat Industry Council is looking at the announcement and the safeguard measures in more detail.\n\n\"We will make strong representations on our members' behalf to the Australian and Chinese governments regarding the severe and unnecessary impact of these new measures,\" Mr Ryan said.\n\nBrazil, the world's largest meat exporter, said on Wednesday it intended to \"work with the Chinese government, both bilaterally and within the WTO (World Trade Organization) framework, to mitigate the impact\" of the new measure.\n\nThe foreign ministry in Brasilia said in a statement that Brazil was the main supplier of beef to China, which accounted for 52 per cent of the South American country's foreign sales of the commodity in 2024.\n\nABC/Reuters/AFP",

I recorded them for, I think, two and a half hours. I've got 22 videos of them telling their whole story, which is really lovely to have because they've now passed away, only in the last month or two,\" Inez says.\n\nThe result is an illustrated coffee table book about how they met, their migration journey from India and their love throughout the years.

They start to look back at the story that has played out in their own life, and they wonder how it reflects a story that might have played out in other people's lives, in their ancestors,\" Dr Wegman says.\n\nRecording your own story\n\nDr Wegman teaches people across the country to record their own stories and says it's best to begin with what you already know, like names, birth dates and maiden names.\n\n\"Once you've got everything clearly laid out in front of you, then you can see where the gaps are,\" she says.\n\nStream But Also John Clarke on ABC iview For over 40 years, the iconic John Clarke tickled the funny bones of Australian and New Zealand audiences.

        "text": "A trove of unsealed cabinet records from 1995 reveals internal government discussions that led to an explosion in the number of poker machines in the Northern Territory.\n\nThat year the NT also passed world-first legislation allowing voluntary assisted dying (VAD), with amendments to the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act discussed in the documents.\n\nThe confidential papers from 30 years prior are released each year to the public by the NT's Library and Archives.\n\nThey contain formal policy submissions to the government of the day.\n\nBut not everything is released \u2014 executive director of the NT's cabinet office Michelle Grantham said 57 documents would remain sealed for legal reasons.\n\n\"Thirty years isn't that long ago and some of these individuals are still alive, so there is a process that records are generally closed or redacted for a further 15 years,\" she said.\n\nWhat was happening in 1995?\n\nIn 1995, South African president Nelson Mandela congratulated the Springbok captain Francois Pienaar after South Africa beat the All Blacks in the Rugby World Cup. (Supplied: Getty Images)\n\nAround the world in 1995, Coolio's song Gangsta's Paradise topped the charts, Windows 95 launched in stores, and Nelson Mandela presented the Rugby World Cup trophy to Springboks captain Francois Pienaar.\n\nIn the territory, discussions were being had about the crocodile farming industry and tourism strategies for Nitmuluk National Park, Adelaide River wetlands and the Mary River National Park.\n\nAlso in 1995, the NT's Country Liberal Party government \u2014 led by Shane Stone after Marshall Perron's retirement \u2014 passed laws that would allow poker machines in the bars of community sporting clubs.\n\nLoading...\n\nA wider gambling study later commissioned by the NT Racing and Gaming Authority (NTRGA) found 530 poker machines were rolled out across 31 community clubs by the end of 1997.\n\nNearly 60 per cent of those venues named the machines as a \"significant\" contributor to gross profits in 1998.\n\nThe unsealed documents show cabinet initially approved $1.9 million to buy and install poker machines at community venues, and projected $3.6 million for machine and maintenance costs the following year.\n\nThe government were predicting a return on its investment too.\n\n\"Treasury's broad estimates are that government's net position, after development costs, will be at least budget neutral in the start up years 1995/96 and 1996/97, with a net revenue gain starting at $5-6m per year from 1997/98,\" a Treasury submission to cabinet said.\n\nNorthern Territory's parliamentary library opened in 1995, after the parliament's grand opening in 1994. (Supplied: Library and Archives NT)\n\nThe Department of Health supported the policy, also saying \"consideration should be given to whether Aboriginal communities currently without liquor licenses should have that situation changed in order to take advantage of the machines\".\n\nThe Gaming Machine Act 1995 passed later that year, and restricted poker machine applications to clubs with liquor licenses, with Darwin's Nightcliff Sports Club the first venue to operate pokies on January 1, 1996.\n\nThe government also offered the territory's two casinos a rebate from club's pokies winnings, to subsidise losing their exclusive access to poker machines.\n\nThe NTRGA study found between January 1996 and December 1997, the MGM Grand Darwin and Lasseter's Hotel Casino in Alice Springs recouped $6.8 million from this rebate, but due to the slow rollout of community machines, did not see a dip in pokies profits.\n\nIn 1995, the Northern Territory made history\n\nIn May 1995 chief minister Marshall Perron resigned from politics, the morning of the second reading of his landmark euthanasia bill, and just hours after informing his ministry.\n\n\"They were very heady days about the bill,\" Mr Perron recalled.\n\n\"I had a good relationship with all of my colleagues in parliament [so] I guess there was some disappointment, but then again the resignation of a chief minister opens up all sorts of opportunities.\"\n\nAn editorial by Chief Minister Marshall Perron regarding euthanasia laws in a Darwin newsletter (Supplied: Library and Archives NT)\n\nHe said the Rights of the Terminally Act as a private member's bill did not go before his cabinet for approval and so was not captured by the NT Archives release of cabinet documents.\n\nBut the documents include discussions months later within cabinet about amendments to mandate a third assessment of applicants by a psychiatrist, following a terminal illness prognosis by a doctor.\n\n\"The present requirement in the act is for the second doctor to certify both the terminal illness and the mental competence of the patient,\" attorney-general Steve Hatton told cabinet.\n\n\"This is considered unnecessarily restrictive as it requires the second doctor to have special medical competence possessed by very few doctors and limits the choice to psychiatrists.\"\n\n\"The reformulation will separate the two functions to make it easier to find competent doctors to certify each aspect.\"\n\nWith weeks to live, Steve hopes the NT legalises VAD in time for others Thirty years ago, the Northern Territory became Australia's first jurisdiction to legislate voluntary assisted dying. Today it is the only one where the practice has not been legalised.\n\nThe amendments were passed in November, but less than a year later a private members bill was introduced and passed by the federal parliament effectively outlawing the practice in the NT.\n\nMr Perron said subsequent VAD bills introduced nationally do not mandate a mental health assessment by psychiatrists.\n\nThe Northern Territory remains the only Australian state or territory where VAD is illegal.",

        "text": "Police say they are generally happy with the behaviour of New Year's Eve revellers in Victoria despite having to respond to hundreds of calls about illegal fireworks.\n\nOfficers arrested 18 people across the state overnight for alleged offences including assaults, driving offences and property crime.\n\nVictoria Police Acting Superintendent Chris Hamilton said they also responded to 313 incidents related to fireworks.\n\n\"I suspect most of those were related to illegal fireworks or homemade fireworks. And sadly, some of those did go pear-shaped,\" he told ABC Radio Melbourne.\n\nActing Superintendent Hamilton said a 31-year-old Mickleham man suffered serious facial injuries and burns and was taken to hospital.\n\n\"We're talking about really a kind of life-changing eye injury with that man,\" he said.\n\nA 43-year-old man in Corio was also taken to hospital with a serious finger injury as a result of fireworks.\n\nPolice detain a man in Melbourne's CBD on New Year's Eve. (ABC News)\n\nAmbulance Victoria said the night was one of the busiest NYE periods in recent years, with caseloads between midnight and 2am 150 per cent higher than previous years in Melbourne's CBD, and 300 per cent higher in the Geelong region.\n\nThere were more than 80 emergency incidents in Melbourne's CBD, with 62 patients treated and 33 taken to hospital.\n\nAmbulance Victoria chief executive officer Jordan Emery said paramedics responded to a wide range of serious and complex incidents overnight.\n\n\"Our paramedics treated a number of high acuity cases, including stabbings, serious assaults and fireworks related injuries, alongside the usual mix of medical emergencies, alcohol related illness, trips and falls,\" Mr Emery said.\n\n\"This was a much busier night than previous years, and our teams worked exceptionally hard under sustained pressure to ensure patients received timely and appropriate care.\"\n\nA rooftop garden at Treasury Place also caught fire due to planned fireworks at 9:30pm but nobody was hurt and there was no significant property damage.\n\nMore than 2,000 police officers were deployed across the state on New Year's Eve. Expanded search powers were in effect in Melbourne's CBD, St Kilda and Geelong as part of Operation OMNI.\n\nMore than 2,000 police officers were deployed across Victoria on New Year's Eve. (ABC News)\n\nPolice said a number of weapons were seized during searches, including an angle grinder, balaclava, gloves and items suspected to be used for breaking and entering.\n\nThe items were found on a 17-year-old boy who was wanted by police on other matters. He was charged and bailed to face a children's court at a later date.\n\nA 15-year-old boy was punched in the face and lost a tooth in Southbank.\n\nAnd police used stop-sticks on a vehicle that took part in a hoon meet at Williams Landing. They arrested a 15-year-old boy and two men aged 23 and 26.\n\nVictoria Police NYE State Commander Belinda Jones said it was a relatively safe celebration across Victoria.\n\n\"Overwhelmingly we saw great behaviour by crowds overnight, with people heeding our advice to celebrate safely and responsibly,\" she said.\n\n\"There was a small number of people who took it too far and chose to do the wrong thing. All reported incidents were resolved quickly, ensuring no disruption to the wider community.\n\n\"I want to thank every police officer who assisted across the state to ensure Victorians could enjoy the festivities safely.\"",

So I think that's probably where it started,\" he said.\n\nWhen he grew up, he turned his childhood dream into a reality and built his very own Jurassic Park Jeep.\n\nZakary Weyer's Jurassic Park Jeep turns heads whenever he drives it. (ABC News: Brant Cumming)\n\n\"It's always been a dream of mine, since I was a kid, to have one of these,\" he said.\n\nIt took a while to find the right car, and while it is not perfectly accurate to the movie, he was still able to make it look as detailed as possible.\n\n\"I've done a few different professions in my time and sort of picked up a lot of different skills that I needed,\" he said.\n\n\"So welding and the metal bending and electrical work for the lighting and all that kind of stuff. [I] just picked it up over the years.\n\n\"There's always some little thing you want to change or make better.\"\n\nZakary Weyer developed the skills needed to build his very own Jurassic Park Jeep. (Supplied: Zakary Weyer)\n\nA T-rex sized hit\n\nJurassic Park premiered in 1993 and quickly became the highest-grossing movie of all time, dethroned five years later by Titanic.\n\nFor a generation of dinosaur-mad children it remains a cornerstone of pop culture, with six sequels and numerous books, TV shows and video games released in the three decades since.\n\nThe dinosaurs are the stars of Jurassic Park, but vehicles play a major role in many of the film's iconic moments.\n\nThere's the scene where Dr Alan Grant \u2014 played by Sam Neill \u2014 and Dr Ellie Sattler \u2014 played by Laura Dern \u2014 watch in awe from a Jeep as a Brachiosaurus walks past, or when a Tyrannosaurus rex breaks free and attacks the park's tour cars.\n\nMr Weyer no longer uses his Jeep for the daily commute, but whenever he takes to Adelaide's roads he can expect the same reaction.\n\n\"Every time I park somewhere basically I get people coming up asking for photos,\" he said.\n\n\"One guy nearly actually crashed his bike getting a gander [as] he was going past.\"\n\nFandom finds a way\n\nThere is a global community dedicated to recreating the cars from Jurassic Park.\n\nByron Phillips is from the Australian branch of the Jurassic Park Motor Pool.\n\nByron Phillips has also recreated the Jurassic Park Jeep.

So it takes away the anxiety of 'where's Dad?'\"\n\nByron Phillips and his Jurassic Park vehicle on a visit to Tamworth.

It felt like a level up. \"\n\nHe even got to outrun a T-rex in one of the vehicles, in his on-screen role as game hunter Robert Muldoon.\n\n\"We had the actors dressed up as Ellie Sattler and Ian Malcolm in the back of the Jeep and it felt a little bit like Jurassic Park virtual reality. It was a bizarre but exciting feeling,\" he said.\n\nThe crew film a scene near Castlemaine in Victoria. (ABC Central Victoria: Shannon Schubert)\n\n'Not as hard as you think'\n\nZakary Weyer said building the Jeep had been a \"life changer\".\n\nIt was also a lot cheaper than he expected, costing around $10,000 for the Jeep, and a further $2,000 on the Jurassic Park fit-out.\n\nZakary Weyer learned metalwork and electrical work to make his own Jurassic Park Jeep. (ABC News: Brant Cumming)\n\nWhether it's a Jurassic Park Jeep, a Back To The Future DeLorean, or a Batmobile, he has a simple message to anyone wanting to recreate their favourite movie vehicle.\n\n\"Just do it.

        "text": "They have at least two songs for every player, plus a vast range of generic Barmy Army songs, plus whatever they manage to come up with.\n\nTo their eternal credit, the Barmy Army have provided a brilliant, vivid backdrop and soundtrack to the summer, singing and chanting their hearts out all over the country, even though the disintegration of Bazball has given them very little to actually cheer about.\n\nEngland\u2019s fans have been louder, wittier and better organised. Unlike the cricket team they followed here, they could go for five days, if required, and maybe longer.\n\nAustralia might have secured a commanding Ashes series victory, in near-record time, but off the field, it\u2019s been a whitewash.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nWe\u2019ve borrowed so many aspects of British sporting culture, from the games we play to the way we play them. But their crowds sing their hearts out, while ours are bereft of creativity. They make up clever songs on the spot, and they catch on. We just tend to shout things on a person-by-person basis. There\u2019s no communal effort.\n\nIt all raises a rather obvious question, one that has been rattling around inside this reporter\u2019s head for many years. Why are we, as a nation, so bad at this?\n\nNot only have they out sang the Aussies at the cricket, but after the Boxing Day Test wrapped up inside just two days , the Barmy Army treated themselves to some soccer, heading along to two A-League matches at Melbourne\u2019s AAMI Park, where they rallied behind the away teams \u2013 and out sang the crowds there, too.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s reflective; that\u2019s all they\u2019ve got in their locker. As soon as the going gets tough for Australia, they disappear. It\u2019s like a fire drill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll play with a beach ball. When they get bored, they\u2019ll start a Mexican wave. And then if they want to go the English, they\u2019ll start with an \u2018Aussie, Aussie, Aussie\u2019, and then they\u2019ll go, maybe, to a \u2018Look at the scoreboard, look at the scoreboard!\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Aussie fans will sit there in silence,\u201d explains Tony Emmerson, a Barmy Army leader who lives in Sydney and helps run the local chapter.\n\nBut the term \u201cbarmy army\u201d had been used on English football terraces long before then. Indeed, all of this can be traced back to soccer, which is \u201cpatient zero\u201d, so to speak: that\u2019s where the culture of singing and chanting first emerged, before \u201cinfecting\u2033\u2063 other sports from there.\n\nThe Barmy Army\u2019s singing and chanting traditions can be traced back to Britain\u2019s most popular sport. Note the football jerseys and flags. Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe Barmy Army was only born during the 1994-95 Ashes series, and started selling their first T-shirts at the fourth Test in Adelaide. The name was given to them by the Australian media: \u201cbarmy\u201d means foolish or irrational, which they were deemed to be because they\u2019d travelled so far to watch their team play miserable, losing cricket; and because there were so many of them, they were an \u201carmy\u201d.\n\nTo understand why Australian crowds don\u2019t sing, we must first understand why British crowds do. Surprisingly, although it would appear to be some centuries-old tradition, they haven\u2019t actually been doing it for that long.\n\nIn the absence of any satisfying answers on the internet or in existing literature, what follows is an attempt to get to the bottom of this enduring mystery, with the assistance of a few experts in the field, and insights gleaned from no less than three books and at least half a dozen academic journals. We\u2019ve gone deep.\n\nThis has always been the way. But why is this the way? How come our national sporting songbook is, at best, a pamphlet? What is it about us, or the way that history has unfolded, that makes Aussie audiences so reserved and timid in comparison?\n\nSuddenly, the shortening of the working week in Britain meant more working-class men weren\u2019t tied up on a Saturday morning \u2013 while the expansion of railway networks and cheaper tickets made it easier for them to travel to watch their teams. Thus, many more people became exposed to what Liverpool supporters were doing (and singing), in the flesh and on television, and came away inspired.\n\nAs Beatlemania shook the world, fans of Liverpool FC began to sing songs by the Beatles and other local artists, such as Cilla Black, as a sort of statement of pride in their community, their team and the musicians who had suddenly put their previously unloved city on the map. The lyrics weren\u2019t about football, but that didn\u2019t matter; they were about love, devotion and heartbreak, emotions that weren\u2019t exactly unfamiliar to football fans. The club also adopted their iconic pre-match anthem You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone when a cover version by another Liverpool band, Gerry & The Pacemakers, topped the UK charts in 1963.\n\nBefore then, most popular music was classical, and generally not targeted at the core demographic attending football games, which was predominantly men under 30.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the explosion of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll music in the 1950s and 60s \u2013 specifically in Liverpool \u2013 that football chanting really began to resemble the more spontaneous, continuous and adaptive form of collective expression as we know it today.\n\nThe earliest known football chant was written in 1898 by the famed composer Edward Elgar about a player for Wolverhampton Wanderers, the lyrics of which were printed in The Times , although there\u2019s no evidence it ever actually caught on. A couple of other songs bobbed up as tributes to the cities or towns where teams were based \u2013 including one by Norwich City fans, \u201cOn The Ball City\u201d, which is still sung today \u2013 but they were exceptions to the rule, rooted in local music hall traditions, and generally sung only once or twice a game. Crucially, the lyrics were non-threatening and jovial.\n\nAfter all, so many of the Barmy Army\u2019s soldiers are also soccer fans, which you can see based on the jerseys they wear and the flags draped over the advertising hoardings, paying tribute to their teams back home \u2013 although, as Emmerson was at pains to point out, those who travelled here from England are \u201cgenuine\u201d cricket tragics who respect the unique rhythms of the game, and aren\u2019t just football supporters getting on the lash.\n\nThe rise of hooliganism through the 1970s and \u201980s added an adversarial element to the mix: supporters of rival clubs would goad each other by trading insults, or boast about their own identities or histories, and songs became more combative and competitive. Sometimes they would be infused with political, racial or religious sentiments, or reference tragedies (like the Hillsborough Stadium disaster) and cross the line of good taste.\n\nIf you could come up with a witty, clever turn of phrase, match it to a song that people already knew, and started singing near the right group of people at a pub, train or in the stands, chances are others might sing along with you, and your composition could take on a life of its own.\n\nAnfield in the 1960s: the birthplace of football chanting as we know it. Credit: Getty Images\n\nInspiration was everywhere. Fans would sing about players they loved (or hated), things that happened on the pitch (or off it), adapting melodies from popular songs or full chants from other teams while simply tweaking the lyrics to suit the subject. One of many, many such examples: Dean Martin\u2019s That\u2019s Amore became a tribute by Brighton fans to Bobby Zamora.\n\n\u201cFans of other teams would turn up at Liverpool ... hear them singing these pop songs and think, \u2018Hang on a minute, we want a little bit of that,\u2019\u201d said Lawn on the podcast Outside Write.\n\nAndrew Lawn, the author of We Lose Every Week: The History of Football Chanting , described what they did next as \u201cmagpie\u201d behaviour: they would take those songs back to their home clubs, change the words and make them their own.\n\nWith the advent of the Premier League in 1992 and the globalisation of the top levels of the game, the communal ritual of British football chanting had, for better or worse, become its own thing \u2013 and that thing was being exported to the world.\n\nSEVEN SONGS THAT DEFINE TERRACE CULTURE 1. You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone An anthem that is also a chant; the gold standard of this particular genre, envied (and copied) the world over. 2. Go West Originally by the Village People, and subsequently by everyone else, this universal melody has been repurposed at almost every football game ever played: \u201cOne nil to the Arsenal\u201d, \u201cStand up, if you love [insert name of team or player here]\u2033\u2063. 3. There\u2019s Only One [player name] A Cuban patriotic song called Guantanamera is now better known as a vehicle for mass praise of athletes - most famously in Australia, probably Tony Lockett. 4. We Lose Every Week, We Lose Every Week, You\u2019re Nothing Special, We Lose Every Week A window into the art of self-deprecation, the melody taken from Sloop John B, a Bahamian folk song from Nassau. 5. Park, Park, Wherever You May Be This one was targeted at former Manchester United star Park Ji-sung, and is very racist, so we won\u2019t run the full thing here - but the tune was Lord of the Dance. 6. Who ate all the pies? Directed at any player deemed to be overweight, inspired by the pub song Knees Up Mother Brown. 7. Sunshine on Leith This 1988 ballad by The Proclaimers is now the unofficial anthem of Scottish club Hibernian, and probably the best current song in world football. Do yourself a favour and look it up.\n\nMeanwhile, in Australia\n\nAustralian sport, in contrast, developed its own distinct style of spectator participation: barracking.\n\nIt emerged in the late 19th century, at a time when Australia\u2019s national character was being forged as a direct and deliberate response to the typical British traits of deference, formality and class-based cohesion. Part of that process was the establishment of Australian rules football in Melbourne, which was embraced partly as a rejection of cultural ties to Europe, and an expression of the nascent Aussie identity.\n\nThe MCG crowd show their appreciation for Scott Boland. Credit: Justin McManus\n\nIn early colonial Australia, sport was a gentlemanly pursuit, and spectators were expected to behave with restraint, mirroring the codes of British respectability. But as Aussie rules gained popularity and drew in more working-class followers, such as labourers and tradesmen, this genteel category began to erode, and was replaced by the \u201cbarracker\u2033\u2063 \u2013 a looser, more raw and rugged type.\n\nIt was not unique to Australia; other Anglophone countries also experienced an increase in a similar kind of crass behaviour from their sporting crowds, too, but only Australians came up with a specific word for it.\n\nThough barracking is now a mere synonym for supporting a team, the term was originally pejorative, used to describe a particular type of supporter: loud, opinionated and boorish men who directed unrelenting partisan insults towards not only the opposition, but the umpire, the on-field arbiter of fairness and justice.\n\nThe rise of barracking from the 1870s was seen as a moral failure and a threat to the ideals being promoted by Australian elites. According to Victoria University researcher Matthew Klugman, newspapers in Melbourne were barely covering Australian rules football until roughly the end of World War I because they didn\u2019t want to encourage the behaviour.\n\n\u201cIt was already too passionate, and passionate in a way that was really scary,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Australian phenomenon of barracking can be traced back to the early days of Aussie rules in Melbourne. Credit: Getty Images\n\nOver time, barracking became not only accepted but a source of pride and an expression of Australianism, and a method of assertive independence from the mother country. In 1890, a writer who went by the name \u201cJEB\u2033\u2063 penned an essay in the South Bourke and Mornington Journal saying that for an Englishman to visit Australia without seeing a football match in Melbourne, and experiencing the atmosphere created by its \u201cattendant multitude of ardent barrackers\u201d, would be akin to an Australian visiting England and not seeing the Tower of London.\n\nFrom there, barracking spread into other sports \u2013 most notably cricket, where the slower pace and quieter nature of the game provided greater scope for those who would indulge in it.\n\nIndeed, the archetypal Australian barracker is immortalised by a bronze statue at the SCG, in the same area where he once bellowed out clever one-line taunts from the old hill.\n\nStephen Harold Gascoigne, or Yabba, is the classic Aussie barracker. Credit: Fairfax Media\n\nStephen Harold Gascoigne, better known as \u201cYabba\u201d, was so famous \u2013 or infamous \u2013 that he was portrayed by an actor in the miniseries Bodyline, based on England\u2019s 1932\u20131933 Ashes tour of Australia. His witty insults (like \u201cLeave our flies alone, they\u2019re the only friends you\u2019ve got!\u201d or \u201cI wish you were a statue and I were a pigeon\u201d) captured the larrikin spirit that had come to define the Australian sporting crowd.\n\nYabba\u2019s style reflected a deeper cultural trait: a national preference for cutting down earnestness, rather than amplifying it. By the 1960s, when football chanting became popular across Britain, Australian sport\u2019s particular proclivities were set in concrete, and so any attempt to start a communal, spur-of-the-moment choir might have been stifled by a Yabba-esque rebuke; the verbal scything of a metaphorical tall poppy.\n\nWriter and historian Les Street reckons it might also come down to historical circumstance. Britain\u2019s pub and working men\u2019s club culture fostered a space where singing was part of the ritual of male camaraderie, so they were predisposed to singing on the terraces. Meanwhile, in Australia, the early 20th-century phenomenon of the six o\u2019clock swill \u2013 where patrons drank quickly before pubs shut at 6pm \u2013 encouraged bingeing over bonding, as men rushed to get as many beers down as possible before closing time.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, it was more about getting pissed ... so these cultural elements couldn\u2019t develop over time,\u201d Street says.\n\nIn any case, because of soccer\u2019s position on the periphery of the Australian psyche, the conditions simply did not exist for the British-style singing and chanting tradition to be borrowed or transferred at the moment it could have been. Soccer in Australia was played mostly in those days by post-war migrants from continental Europe and was regarded as a game for \u201cshielas, wogs and poofters\u2033\u2063, in the words of legendary Socceroo Johnny Warren. Aussie rules, the rugby codes and cricket were the dominant sports, defining what was considered Australian and, by extension, un-Australian, forming an institutional atmosphere that was not conducive to the kind of free-form, collective spontaneity that was thriving on the British terraces.\n\nThe line for beers at the Princes Bridge Hotel in Melbourne in 1965, just before closing time at 6pm. Credit: Fairfax Photographic\n\nLong before then, of course, soccer had been abandoned specifically because of its popularity and history in Britain; as illustrated by a letter to the Sunshine Advocate in Melbourne in 1927, some even saw the code as \u201cpart of an organised movement to destroy Australianism\u201d itself. Many British immigrants to Australia also dropped their support for the game upon their arrival, or at least chose not to become engaged with the local scene, and continued to support their \u201chome\u2033\u2063 club from afar. As a result, opportunities for this shift in football fan culture to be adopted more broadly across Australian sport were limited, and to the extent that chanting did (and does) happen in domestic soccer, the influence was probably more European than British.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t believe how quiet it was\u2019\n\nMusic, and singing, does have its place in Australian sport. In the AFL, there are club songs, which fans perform with gusto before every match (and after, if they\u2019re lucky). Written in 1906, Collingwood\u2019s was the first adopted by a then-VFL team, and it contains a relevant lyric, reflecting how barracking had been so broadly embedded that it was considered a basic right: \u201cSee the barrackers a-shouting, as all barrackers should!\u2033\u2063\n\nCertain teams have their own rituals and anthems. Port Adelaide\u2019s fans sing INXS\u2019s Never Tear Us Apart just before the start of home games, while Melbourne Victory\u2019s unofficial theme song is Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes, which was written 700 metres up the road from AAMI Park at the Corner Hotel in Richmond.\n\nNever Tear Us Apart has become a pre-match anthem at Port Adelaide matches. Credit: Getty Images\n\nThere is the newer, American-ish phenomenon of \u201cgoal songs\u2033\u2063, which certain AFL teams play over the loudspeakers after a specific player has kicked a goal, and supporters follow along like a karaoke session. Brisbane Lions star Charlie Cameron\u2019s chosen song is John Denver\u2019s Take Me Home, Country Roads, which has become a feature of their home matches at the Gabba. The crowd sings every word; in the 2023 qualifying final, they had not yet finished when Cameron kicked his second goal within a minute, creating a spine-tingling viral moment.\n\nThere are also occasional exceptions to the rule, like random renditions of Waltzing Matilda and Sweet Caroline here and there, and the odd chant that does take off, like \u2018Ooh! Aah! Glenn McGrath!\u2019 \u2013 but, by and large, as far as making songs there and then, it doesn\u2019t really go beyond the kind of repetitive clap-based chants you\u2019d hear at a high school sports day.\n\nDavid Rowe, emeritus professor at the Institute for Culture and Society, Western Sydney University, is a leading global authority on sport sociology and cultural studies. He is also a lifelong Plymouth Argyle fan, and therefore takes almost personal offence at Australia\u2019s most common sporting chant, \u2018Aussie Aussie Aussie! Oi! Oi! Oi!\u2019 \u2013 which is not only a national embarrassment, but not even original. It\u2019s a direct rip-off.\n\n\u2018Oggy Oggy Oggy! Oi! Oi! Oi!\u2019 has been in use in a British sporting context since as far back as World War II. An \u201coggy\u2033\u2063 is a Cornish pasty, a shortcrust pastry filled with meat and vegetables; the story goes that the vendors selling them used to yell the first part, and their customers would respond with the second. It was then adopted by fans of Plymouth Argyle, the local football club in Devon, and stolen at some point by Australians, gaining widespread popularity during the Sydney 2000 Olympics.\n\n\u201cAustralia hasn\u2019t had that [same] kind of cultural tradition, so they try to borrow it. It often sounds really lame,\u201d Rowe says.\n\n\u201cWhen I came to Australia, I lived quite a few years in Newcastle, and I went to a major grudge match between the Newcastle Knights and the Brisbane Broncos \u2026 I couldn\u2019t believe how quiet it was. My rule of thumb is that a British football crowd of 5000 is noisier than a 20,000-25,000 crowd at Australian rules or rugby league.\u201c\n\nWho do we sing for?\n\nThe most extensive efforts to change this have taken place within Australian soccer.\n\nGrant Muir has been a part of The Cove, Sydney FC\u2019s main supporter group, since the club was founded 20 years ago and has spent most of that time trying to convince Australians to sing along with him. A Scottish migrant, he can recall plenty of examples where he and others have tried to get something going, only to fail miserably.\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cNot every chant is a banger. Sometimes you think you\u2019ve got the best chant ever, and everybody just kind of turns around and looks at you. There\u2019s a lack of willingness to experiment sometimes. It\u2019s that kind of Australian lack of confidence, cultural cringe: if other football fans overseas are doing it, it must be great, but we can\u2019t possibly come up with something that would be as good as that.\u201d\n\nSydney FC\u2019s main supporter group, The Cove. Credit: Getty Images\n\nMuir reckons it\u2019s gotten easier over time, but only in specific circumstances.\n\n\u201cIt very, very, very rarely happens organically, but if you do a chant that intentionally tries to engage people outside of the active support area, it\u2019ll work if it\u2019s done at the right time, if the mood is right,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point in trying to do it when you\u2019re 4-0 down on a wet Saturday night, but if it\u2019s the right game and the right atmosphere, a call and response chant \u2026 that can work. And once you\u2019ve established the pattern, that it\u2019s OK, it\u2019s not embarrassing, it\u2019s good fun, then it gets easier.\u201d\n\nThe most recognisable example in the A-League of what Muir is talking about \u2013 with all due respect to The Cove \u2013 is courtesy of the Red and Black Bloc, the rival faction supporting the Western Sydney Wanderers. When the Wanderers were born in 2012 and became an instant national sensation, the RBB\u2019s songbook became just as iconic as the team\u2019s hooped home jersey, and this chant in particular, which gets other sections of the stadium involved: \u201cWho do we sing for? We sing for Wanderers.\u201d\n\nThe RBB\u2019s vibe is a blend of continental European and South American influences, and their manner of support is highly orchestrated and coordinated, with a person known as a \u201ccapo\u2033\u2063 usually leading chants and songs \u2013 as opposed to the more spontaneous, improvisational British style, where anyone can come up with something. They are constant for 90 minutes, devoting their bodies to the greater cause of their teams, rather than reacting to what is in front of them.\n\nBut because this kind of behaviour is still culturally foreign in Australia, police and security guards usually seek to shut it down rather than understand it \u2013 while, in turn, active fans light flares and cause mayhem that triggers further clampdowns. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. The A-League can still match the atmospheres in Europe on its best days, but for that, and a number of other reasons, those transcendent moments are fewer and further between.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just a culture thing\u2019\n\nMuir suspects there are other factors underpinning the Australian reticence. The stadiums he grew up attending in Scotland were usually smaller, tighter and fully enclosed, with roofs, amplifying the volume of whatever noise was made by the crowd \u2013 in direct contrast with Australian sporting venues, which tend to be wide-open bowls with no cover. In the A-League, most teams do not come even remotely close to filling the capacity of their home grounds, making it even harder to retain any atmosphere generated.\n\nMuir\u2019s boyhood team was Hamilton Academical, and he watched them play every weekend with his father at a \u201cshitty old stadium\u201d called Douglas Park. Save for a small grandstand with seats for the club\u2019s cashed-up supporters, it was mostly made up of terracing, or standing areas, which was more conducive to singing than sitting down.\n\nThe Anfield Kop as it used to be: full of terracing. Credit: Getty Images\n\n\u201cI think that that had a huge amount to do with it,\u201d Muir says. \u201cPeople stood. Australian stadiums are almost all all-seaters, right?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why choirs stand up.\u201c\n\nWill we ever change? Can we? With so many historical, social and structural factors at play, it\u2019s difficult to imagine a world where Aussie crowds suddenly become singers, en masse, and compete with the Poms on that front. It\u2019s just not in us.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing; we\u2019re passionate, highly knowledgeable people when it comes to sport, and the absence of singing does not necessarily equate to an absence of tension or atmosphere.\n\nWe\u2019re just wired differently, and that\u2019s OK.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the genealogy of British sports fans to sing at sporting events,\u201d Emmerson says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the way you grow up; it\u2019s just a culture thing. I don\u2019t know how Australia starts that. I don\u2019t know where the creativity comes from.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m available for consultancy, if you want me to help you Aussies with some songs.\u201d\n\nAnother moral victory to England, then. We\u2019ll stick to the real ones, on the field.",

Adapted by Andrew Lloyd Webber, the musical forfeits a straight narrative arc, instead choosing to focus on spotlighting various street cats and their idiosyncratic personalities.\n\nThis year marks its 40th anniversary in Australia. Playing not in the Arts Centre, but at Hamer Hall, Cats is the first time a full-scale musical is being staged there. The concert hall, with its superior acoustics, is undoubtedly a purrfect venue to house the likes of more than two dozen supersized felines crawling, prowling, preening, hissing, cavorting and yes of course, singing their furry hearts out.\n\nThis production has far more than nine lives. In fact, Cats is now 44 years old; to mark its grand old age, the show is touring the country and has just returned to Melbourne.\n\nDon\u2019t look too deeply into the plot; there\u2019s some ludicrous guff about an annual meeting of these creatures to determine which one will be chosen to be reborn into a new life. (By what criteria they have to fulfil to be worthy of such an honour is never made clear.)\n\nIf you\u2019re here, it\u2019s probably for the costume, choreography and musical compositions. A fair few in the clowder of cats have their moment in the moonlight, accompanied by a live orchestra, with different musical styles to suit the personality of each character, including rock, jazz and blues tunes.\n\nDes Flanagan as Rum Tum Tugger. Credit: Penny Stephens\n\nAnd though yes, the singing is as strong as expected in a production as famous and long-standing as this one, there\u2019s a certain lack of imagination in having each cat front up and do their bit, before slinking away and allowing another one to have their turn. The rest act as a clamouring chorus. Memory is still by far the best (and most memorable) song in the show, which explains why it\u2019s repeated several times.\n\nAgainst a junkyard set that\u2019s suitably gloomy, with a number of hidey-holes, the cats come out for play. Eliot was inventive with names: there\u2019s Bustopher Jones and Asparagus (both played by Todd McKenney), Rum Tum Tugger (Des Flanagan), Munkustrap (Jarrod Draper) and Old Deuteronomy (Mark Vincent) among the many night marauders.",

Mewis, a 34-year-old former West Ham United player, revealed earlier on a podcast that the pair had discovered the venue almost two years ago.\n\nKerr, who is currently a striker for Chelsea in the Women\u2019s Super League, was photographed as she headed to the villa dressed in a sleek black-and-white suit. She was also holding a baby bottle for her seven-month-old son, Jagger, who reportedly was dressed in a mini matching outfit and who would join Kerr down the aisle later in the day.\n\nGroups of guests, most of whom were dressed in black ensembles, were ferried from Crown Towers to the wedding venue on large buses, including fellow Matildas players Steph Catley, Alanna Kennedy, Caitlin Foord and Mackenzie Arnold, as well as Irish footballer Katie McCabe and Kerr\u2019s brother, Daniel. They were greeted at the venue by a violin and cello duet.",

        "text": "The wobble seam is bowled with the fingers wide of the seam and held loosely, rather than in a conventional upright position. This delivery wobbles in the air. After pitching, the delivery moves in one of three directions: away from the batsman, into the batsman, or it remains along its previous path, without deviating. Bowlers themselves are not even sure about how the ball will move. \u201cNo one really knows whether it\u2019s going to nip or not, and which way it\u2019s going to nip,\u201d former England fast bowler Chris Woakes said earlier this year. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know, the batter doesn\u2019t.\u201d The uncertainty over which way the ball will move makes the wobble seam venomous. Consider two of Boland\u2019s wickets this series. On the third evening in Brisbane, Harry Brook shaped to defend, assuming that the ball would hold its line. Instead, the delivery moved away a scintilla, and kissed the outside edge. On the first evening in Melbourne, Jamie Smith pushed forward to defend, just as Brook had done. This time, the batsman was deceived by a delivery that curved in to uproot his middle stump. Like many of his fellow batters, Marnus Labuschagne has endured some Ashes pain. Credit: Getty Images\n\nLike many supposed modern inventions, the wobble seam is really a reinvention. In the 1990s, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh and Allan Donald all bowled what would now be known as the wobble seam, using the delivery to try and nullify Sachin Tendulkar. The modern incarnation of the wobble seam was popularised by Australia\u2019s Stuart Clark and Pakistan\u2019s Mohammad Asif in the late 2000s. Observing Asif in 2010 led James Anderson to develop the ball \u2013 to great effect \u2013 in time for the 2010-11 Ashes. In the 15 years since, the delivery has increasingly become the default for leading quick bowlers around the world. Batting \u2018blind\u2019 Physics explains why the wobble seam is so lethal. Facing 130km/h bowling, a batsman has about 0.55 seconds between the ball being delivered and reaching them. This decreases further, to 0.4 seconds, when speeds reach 145km/h. Batsmen must commit to their shot 0.15 seconds before the ball reaches them, as demonstrated by research by David Mann, who has worked with Australian Test batsmen. During the last 150 milliseconds of a ball\u2019s trajectory, a batsman is effectively blind. In this period, batsmen cannot make any further adjustments to their strokes.\n\nWith wobble seam, all the deviation occurs in these 0.15 seconds, when it is too late for batsmen to change their shots. This is why Brook and Smith were both dismissed by Boland\u2019s wobble seam, but by deliveries that moved in the opposite direction. While Mitchell Starc has used swing devastatingly this series, even he now uses wobble seam regularly. Though swing is more alluring than seam, it gives batsmen more visual cues about what to expect, based on how the ball is delivered, and more time to adjust, as the ball movement happens before pitching. Scott Boland\u2019s accuracy has troubled England. Credit: Getty Images From 2017-24, balls that swung more than 1.5 degrees in Tests averaged 23 runs per wicket. Balls that seamed more than 0.75 degrees averaged just 17. Half as much seam, then, is more dangerous than twice as much swing. Unrelenting accuracy\n\nWhile progress is hard to measure precisely in such a multifaceted game such as Test cricket, there is strong reason to think that today\u2019s Test seamers are more accurate than ever before. This observation is not to disparage past greats, but recognise the greater depth of today\u2019s Test attacks, and how they are better equipped to absorb injuries. Even in the absence of two of their three leading seam bowlers, Australia have demonstrated remarkable accuracy: the ability to pound out a good line and length relentlessly, thereby maximising all assistance offered. One finding by CricViz, the data-tracking company, emphasises Boland\u2019s skill. Based on a player\u2019s ability to bowl on both a good line and length, Boland is the most accurate seamer in history, since ball-tracking data was introduced in 2005. This makes Boland more accurate even than Glenn McGrath, when he was recorded at the end of his career. Green pitches\n\nThree millimetres of grass: that was all it took to cause national uproar down under. These three millimetres at the MCG were the difference between the 7mm of grass for last year\u2019s MCG Test against India, a classic that finished in the last throes on day five, and the 10mm for this year\u2019s two-day affair. The MCG\u2019s curator \u2013 to use the nomenclature beloved in Australia \u2013 Matt Page said that he was in a \u201cstate of shock\u201d. The pitch was officially graded \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d by match officials. The opening Test, at Perth, also offered appreciable seam movement to go with bounce. Yet either side of these Tests, batsmen have thrived. Across Brisbane and Adelaide, the teams averaged a combined 34.9 per wicket \u2013 the equivalent of a very healthy 349 being scored in all four innings of the match. The difference between these two Tests and the games in Perth and Melbourne illustrates how greater deviation transforms the dynamics of matches. Batters\u2019 responses Aspects of batting technique this series can justifiably be criticised: at Melbourne, Smith was bowled through an inviting gate between bat and pad. Modern batsmen have far less experience in defending than players of previous generations, before the short-formats mushroomed.\n\nBrook\u2019s response to walking out at 3-8 in England\u2019s first innings at Melbourne showed the very different approach that is today\u2019s zeitgeist. Facing Starc with the new ball, Brook charged down the pitch and attempted a huge swipe that met only thin air. \u201cOh what has he done? Oh dear me,\u201d exclaimed Jonathan Agnew live on Test Match Special, speaking for thousands of English cricket fans. Loading Yet there was method in Brook\u2019s audacity. On a pitch offering such lavish seam movement, his approach aimed to meet the ball before it could deviate off the pitch, and score runs before he encountered a fatal delivery. Remarkably, the English batsman advanced down the wicket to five of his first 15 balls. For all the mocking, Brook\u2019s plan worked. He scored more runs than anyone on either side in the Test, making a total of 59 for only once out. Joe Root adopted a far more orthodox approach, the sort that would be free from criticism if it failed. Yet he still only lasted 53 balls in the Test and made a duck and 15 across the two innings. Perhaps batting techniques have indeed declined. But to see such a high-class technician as Root flounder at the MCG was to be reminded that when bowling is this accurate, on a pitch offering abundant movement, batsmen\u2019s agency in their fate is limited.",

Upon investigation, we found out that they're actually not being interviewed face to face, but actually being interviewed by videos slash AI interviews and because they've never been exposed to it before, I think they just failed because they don't know what to do.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTheir experience is not unique, with job seekers increasingly sharing their own experiences with so-called \"robo\" interviews on social media.\n\n\n\n\n\nMAN: \"Hello.\"\n\n\n\nROBOT: \"Hi, thank you so much for joining the interview today. I'm so excited to talk to you and get to know more about you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Robo\" interviews are when a candidate is interviewed by an AI system rather than a human.\n\n\n\n\n\nFittock says this style of interview can add extra barriers for migrant and refugee applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The challenges with these AI recruitment or AI interview for some of our sisters is really, first of all, English is not their first language, but also the level of digital literacy that they may or may not have because they need to actually navigate through, apart from answering questions, they also need to navigate that click of a button and pay attention to the timer and all that pressure really mounting up, especially when you see the ticking clock running in front of you. So it's all really quite confronting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2024, 43 percent of organisations use AI \"moderately\" in their recruitment, while 19 per cent use the technology \"extensively\" when hiring new staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's according to The Australian Responsible AI report, which details how Australian businesses are tracking when it comes to AI practices.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs employers increasingly embrace AI, video interview training is now part of the Sisterworks job course.\n\n\n\n\n\nFatemeh Hazrati - orginally from Iran - is among those currently taking part in the program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"AI has real big effect on our life nowadays. All of us have to learn it, [and] [We] just need to adapt ourself for new things and accept challenges to learn new things.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAI in recruitment is often touted for its ability to save both time and money.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there are mounting concerns around its potential to discriminate.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Natalie Sheard is from the Melbourne Law School at the University of Melbourne.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe led a study published earlier this month [[May 14]] that suggests AI hiring systems are creating new barriers to employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So it could be older applicants, women, people who speak English as a second language, job seekers with disabilities. In my research I heard of systems not being accessible to job seekers with disabilities. I heard of CV screening systems using things like gaps in employment history to screen candidates out and having a gap in your employment history is a well-known proxy for gender as women tend to have time out of the workforce to care for family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also explains how those with English as a second language can be disadvantaged in video interviews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Another concern is that the way these systems tend to operate is the AI doesn't assess the video. What happens is the audio from your video is transcribed and then AI is used to evaluate your answer and it's well established that those transcription services perform poorly for people who speak English as a second language or have accents.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMonash University's Professor Andreas Leibbrandt has also researched the role of AI in recruitment.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says there are benefits to the technology, and if deployed correctly, a system can be less bias than a human.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn one study, conducted in the US, he found women and non-anglo candidates are more likely to apply for a job if they know AI tools are being used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not that both women or ethnic minorities feel there's no bias in the AI algorithm, but they feel that this bias is less so than when they're faced with a human recruiter.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he's concerned by a lack of transparency, regulation and potential bias built into algorithms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These AI algorithm are fed with training data sets or data sets from corporations. But their training data in itself may be biased. It may come from an organisation where there was, for instance, bias against women.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue around data sets and algorithms also emerged in Doctor Sheard's research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So one example there is a lot of these systems are built overseas, so they might've been trained on data on populations that aren't comparable to the Australian population. And therefore again, the system won't perform as well for particular demographic groups that we have in Australia. For example, refugees, migrant women, first Nations, Australians.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are growing calls for the Australian government to better regulate the use of AI in recruitment.\n\n\n\n\n\nCatherine Hunter is the CEO of Diversity Council Australia - the independent not-for-profit peak body leading diversity and inclusion in the workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With such high adoption rates and the rapid acceleration of the technology, we're just concerned that people aren't putting in place the proper considerations around ethical use.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Australian singer Danielle Marsh, a member of the Korean pop (K-pop) group NewJeans, is facing a lawsuit exceeding $44 million from a South Korean record company owned by the K-pop giant that produces BTS.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarsh, 20, was born in NSW to an Australian father and a South Korean mother. She rose to global prominence in 2022 following the debut of NewJeans, a five-member group whose members were aged between 14 and 18 at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nNewJeans was created and produced by ADOR, a subsidiary of HYBE Entertainment. HYBE, one of the world's largest K-pop companies, is estimated to have recorded cumulative revenue of approximately $2.075 billion up to the third quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, five NewJeans songs topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart, cementing the group's rapid rise globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, ADOR filed a lawsuit against NewJeans after the group accused the label of \"mistreatment\" and announced plans to leave the agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn October, a South Korean court found no grounds for termination and ruled the group must continue under their contract with ADOR until 2029.\n\n\n\nFollowing the ruling, South Korean media reported all five members were expected to return to the agency. However, an announcement from ADOR on Monday has shocked K-pop fans worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, ADOR said that while it had been engaging with the remaining four members \u2014 including another Australian member, Hanni Pham \u2014 the agency had decided to terminate its contracts with Marsh.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company said it also intended to \"pursue legal accountability against one member of Danielle's family\" as well as ADOR's former CEO, Min Hee-Jin, who the BBC described as the \"mentor\" of the group.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agency said Marsh's family member and Min \"bear significant responsibility for causing this dispute and for the delays in NewJeans' departure and return\".\n\n\n\nSouth Korean news outlet The Chosun Daily reported on Monday that ADOR had filed a claim with the Seoul District Court for more than $44 million in damages against Marsh, Marsh's family member, and Min.\n\n\n\nAustralian singer gave testimony over alleged workplace bullying\n\nBeyond its multi-billion-dollar revenues and global soft-power reach, the K-pop industry is widely known for exerting strict control over artists through long-term contracts with detailed and often rigid conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legal dispute between NewJeans and ADOR has sent shockwaves through South Korea's music industry, drawing widespread attention from international fans.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome have expressed sympathy for NewJeans over allegations of bullying and harassment allegedly directed or condoned by the company.\n\n\n\n\n\nFans of Pham \u2014 the Vietnamese-Australian member of the group \u2014 submitted a petition to the South Korean government calling for an investigation into the alleged workplace bullying she and the group faced.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn October 2024, Pham delivered a tearful testimony before South Korea's parliament over the allegations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know it's not going to solve all the problems in the world, but if we just respect each other, at least there will be no problems with bullying and harassment in the workplace,\" Reuters quoted Pham telling South Korean leaders.\n\n\n\nOne month later, South Korea's employment ministry dismissed NewJeans' workplace bullying complaint, stating that under the country's Labour Standards Act, Pham was not legally classified as an \"employee\" of ADOR.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision prompted several leaders to propose new legislation \u2014 now dubbed \"Hanni's Act\" \u2014 aimed at extending protections against workplace bullying and harassment to artists.\n\n\n\n\n\nPham also faced the possibility of deportation after her long-term employer-sponsored work visa was set to expire in early 2025 amid the ongoing legal dispute. Her parents confirmed in February that she had secured a new visa.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat same month, The Chosun Daily reported that five of South Korea's major industrial bodies issued a joint statement criticising NewJeans for \"resolving private disputes through media campaigns and unilateral public statements rather than proper negotiations or legal procedures\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the organisations said they did not oppose government regulation, they argued that contract disputes between agencies and artists should be addressed through industry self-regulation.\n\n\n\n",

Unlike the cricket team they followed here, they could go for five days, if required, and maybe longer.\n\nAustralia might have secured a commanding Ashes series victory, in near-record time, but off the field, it\u2019s been a whitewash.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nWe\u2019ve borrowed so many aspects of British sporting culture, from the games we play to the way we play them. But their crowds sing their hearts out, while ours are bereft of creativity. They make up clever songs on the spot, and they catch on. We just tend to shout things on a person-by-person basis. There\u2019s no communal effort.\n\nIt all raises a rather obvious question, one that has been rattling around inside this reporter\u2019s head for many years. Why are we, as a nation, so bad at this?\n\nNot only have they out sang the Aussies at the cricket, but after the Boxing Day Test wrapped up inside just two days , the Barmy Army treated themselves to some soccer, heading along to two A-League matches at Melbourne\u2019s AAMI Park, where they rallied behind the away teams \u2013 and out sang the crowds there, too.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s reflective; that\u2019s all they\u2019ve got in their locker. As soon as the going gets tough for Australia, they disappear. It\u2019s like a fire drill.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll play with a beach ball. When they get bored, they\u2019ll start a Mexican wave. And then if they want to go the English, they\u2019ll start with an \u2018Aussie, Aussie, Aussie\u2019, and then they\u2019ll go, maybe, to a \u2018Look at the scoreboard, look at the scoreboard!\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Aussie fans will sit there in silence,\u201d explains Tony Emmerson, a Barmy Army leader who lives in Sydney and helps run the local chapter.\n\nBut the term \u201cbarmy army\u201d had been used on English football terraces long before then. Indeed, all of this can be traced back to soccer, which is \u201cpatient zero\u201d, so to speak: that\u2019s where the culture of singing and chanting first emerged, before \u201cinfecting\u2033\u2063 other sports from there.\n\nThe Barmy Army\u2019s singing and chanting traditions can be traced back to Britain\u2019s most popular sport. Note the football jerseys and flags. Credit: Getty Images\n\nThe Barmy Army was only born during the 1994-95 Ashes series, and started selling their first T-shirts at the fourth Test in Adelaide. The name was given to them by the Australian media: \u201cbarmy\u201d means foolish or irrational, which they were deemed to be because they\u2019d travelled so far to watch their team play miserable, losing cricket; and because there were so many of them, they were an \u201carmy\u201d.\n\nTo understand why Australian crowds don\u2019t sing, we must first understand why British crowds do. Surprisingly, although it would appear to be some centuries-old tradition, they haven\u2019t actually been doing it for that long.\n\nIn the absence of any satisfying answers on the internet or in existing literature, what follows is an attempt to get to the bottom of this enduring mystery, with the assistance of a few experts in the field, and insights gleaned from no less than three books and at least half a dozen academic journals. We\u2019ve gone deep.\n\nThis has always been the way. But why is this the way? How come our national sporting songbook is, at best, a pamphlet? What is it about us, or the way that history has unfolded, that makes Aussie audiences so reserved and timid in comparison?\n\nSuddenly, the shortening of the working week in Britain meant more working-class men weren\u2019t tied up on a Saturday morning \u2013 while the expansion of railway networks and cheaper tickets made it easier for them to travel to watch their teams. Thus, many more people became exposed to what Liverpool supporters were doing (and singing), in the flesh and on television, and came away inspired.\n\nAs Beatlemania shook the world, fans of Liverpool FC began to sing songs by the Beatles and other local artists, such as Cilla Black, as a sort of statement of pride in their community, their team and the musicians who had suddenly put their previously unloved city on the map. The lyrics weren\u2019t about football, but that didn\u2019t matter; they were about love, devotion and heartbreak, emotions that weren\u2019t exactly unfamiliar to football fans. The club also adopted their iconic pre-match anthem You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone when a cover version by another Liverpool band, Gerry & The Pacemakers, topped the UK charts in 1963.\n\nBefore then, most popular music was classical, and generally not targeted at the core demographic attending football games, which was predominantly men under 30.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the explosion of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll music in the 1950s and 60s \u2013 specifically in Liverpool \u2013 that football chanting really began to resemble the more spontaneous, continuous and adaptive form of collective expression as we know it today.\n\nThe earliest known football chant was written in 1898 by the famed composer Edward Elgar about a player for Wolverhampton Wanderers, the lyrics of which were printed in The Times , although there\u2019s no evidence it ever actually caught on. A couple of other songs bobbed up as tributes to the cities or towns where teams were based \u2013 including one by Norwich City fans, \u201cOn The Ball City\u201d, which is still sung today \u2013 but they were exceptions to the rule, rooted in local music hall traditions, and generally sung only once or twice a game. Crucially, the lyrics were non-threatening and jovial.\n\nAfter all, so many of the Barmy Army\u2019s soldiers are also soccer fans, which you can see based on the jerseys they wear and the flags draped over the advertising hoardings, paying tribute to their teams back home \u2013 although, as Emmerson was at pains to point out, those who travelled here from England are \u201cgenuine\u201d cricket tragics who respect the unique rhythms of the game, and aren\u2019t just football supporters getting on the lash.\n\nThe rise of hooliganism through the 1970s and \u201980s added an adversarial element to the mix: supporters of rival clubs would goad each other by trading insults, or boast about their own identities or histories, and songs became more combative and competitive. Sometimes they would be infused with political, racial or religious sentiments, or reference tragedies (like the Hillsborough Stadium disaster) and cross the line of good taste.\n\nIf you could come up with a witty, clever turn of phrase, match it to a song that people already knew, and started singing near the right group of people at a pub, train or in the stands, chances are others might sing along with you, and your composition could take on a life of its own.\n\nAnfield in the 1960s: the birthplace of football chanting as we know it. Credit: Getty Images\n\nInspiration was everywhere. Fans would sing about players they loved (or hated), things that happened on the pitch (or off it), adapting melodies from popular songs or full chants from other teams while simply tweaking the lyrics to suit the subject. One of many, many such examples: Dean Martin\u2019s That\u2019s Amore became a tribute by Brighton fans to Bobby Zamora.\n\n\u201cFans of other teams would turn up at Liverpool ... hear them singing these pop songs and think, \u2018Hang on a minute, we want a little bit of that,\u2019\u201d said Lawn on the podcast Outside Write.\n\nAndrew Lawn, the author of We Lose Every Week: The History of Football Chanting , described what they did next as \u201cmagpie\u201d behaviour: they would take those songs back to their home clubs, change the words and make them their own.\n\nWith the advent of the Premier League in 1992 and the globalisation of the top levels of the game, the communal ritual of British football chanting had, for better or worse, become its own thing \u2013 and that thing was being exported to the world.\n\nSEVEN SONGS THAT DEFINE TERRACE CULTURE 1. You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone An anthem that is also a chant; the gold standard of this particular genre, envied (and copied) the world over. 2. Go West Originally by the Village People, and subsequently by everyone else, this universal melody has been repurposed at almost every football game ever played: \u201cOne nil to the Arsenal\u201d, \u201cStand up, if you love [insert name of team or player here]\u2033\u2063. 3. There\u2019s Only One [player name] A Cuban patriotic song called Guantanamera is now better known as a vehicle for mass praise of athletes - most famously in Australia, probably Tony Lockett. 4. We Lose Every Week, We Lose Every Week, You\u2019re Nothing Special, We Lose Every Week A window into the art of self-deprecation, the melody taken from Sloop John B, a Bahamian folk song from Nassau. 5. Park, Park, Wherever You May Be This one was targeted at former Manchester United star Park Ji-sung, and is very racist, so we won\u2019t run the full thing here - but the tune was Lord of the Dance. 6. Who ate all the pies? Directed at any player deemed to be overweight, inspired by the pub song Knees Up Mother Brown. 7. Sunshine on Leith This 1988 ballad by The Proclaimers is now the unofficial anthem of Scottish club Hibernian, and probably the best current song in world football. Do yourself a favour and look it up.\n\nMeanwhile, in Australia\n\nAustralian sport, in contrast, developed its own distinct style of spectator participation: barracking.\n\nIt emerged in the late 19th century, at a time when Australia\u2019s national character was being forged as a direct and deliberate response to the typical British traits of deference, formality and class-based cohesion. Part of that process was the establishment of Australian rules football in Melbourne, which was embraced partly as a rejection of cultural ties to Europe, and an expression of the nascent Aussie identity.\n\nThe MCG crowd show their appreciation for Scott Boland. Credit: Justin McManus\n\nIn early colonial Australia, sport was a gentlemanly pursuit, and spectators were expected to behave with restraint, mirroring the codes of British respectability. But as Aussie rules gained popularity and drew in more working-class followers, such as labourers and tradesmen, this genteel category began to erode, and was replaced by the \u201cbarracker\u2033\u2063 \u2013 a looser, more raw and rugged type.\n\nIt was not unique to Australia; other Anglophone countries also experienced an increase in a similar kind of crass behaviour from their sporting crowds, too, but only Australians came up with a specific word for it.\n\nThough barracking is now a mere synonym for supporting a team, the term was originally pejorative, used to describe a particular type of supporter: loud, opinionated and boorish men who directed unrelenting partisan insults towards not only the opposition, but the umpire, the on-field arbiter of fairness and justice.\n\nThe rise of barracking from the 1870s was seen as a moral failure and a threat to the ideals being promoted by Australian elites. According to Victoria University researcher Matthew Klugman, newspapers in Melbourne were barely covering Australian rules football until roughly the end of World War I because they didn\u2019t want to encourage the behaviour.\n\n\u201cIt was already too passionate, and passionate in a way that was really scary,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Australian phenomenon of barracking can be traced back to the early days of Aussie rules in Melbourne. Credit: Getty Images\n\nOver time, barracking became not only accepted but a source of pride and an expression of Australianism, and a method of assertive independence from the mother country. In 1890, a writer who went by the name \u201cJEB\u2033\u2063 penned an essay in the South Bourke and Mornington Journal saying that for an Englishman to visit Australia without seeing a football match in Melbourne, and experiencing the atmosphere created by its \u201cattendant multitude of ardent barrackers\u201d, would be akin to an Australian visiting England and not seeing the Tower of London.\n\nFrom there, barracking spread into other sports \u2013 most notably cricket, where the slower pace and quieter nature of the game provided greater scope for those who would indulge in it.\n\nIndeed, the archetypal Australian barracker is immortalised by a bronze statue at the SCG, in the same area where he once bellowed out clever one-line taunts from the old hill.\n\nStephen Harold Gascoigne, or Yabba, is the classic Aussie barracker. Credit: Fairfax Media\n\nStephen Harold Gascoigne, better known as \u201cYabba\u201d, was so famous \u2013 or infamous \u2013 that he was portrayed by an actor in the miniseries Bodyline, based on England\u2019s 1932\u20131933 Ashes tour of Australia. His witty insults (like \u201cLeave our flies alone, they\u2019re the only friends you\u2019ve got!\u201d or \u201cI wish you were a statue and I were a pigeon\u201d) captured the larrikin spirit that had come to define the Australian sporting crowd.\n\nYabba\u2019s style reflected a deeper cultural trait: a national preference for cutting down earnestness, rather than amplifying it. By the 1960s, when football chanting became popular across Britain, Australian sport\u2019s particular proclivities were set in concrete, and so any attempt to start a communal, spur-of-the-moment choir might have been stifled by a Yabba-esque rebuke; the verbal scything of a metaphorical tall poppy.\n\nWriter and historian Les Street reckons it might also come down to historical circumstance. Britain\u2019s pub and working men\u2019s club culture fostered a space where singing was part of the ritual of male camaraderie, so they were predisposed to singing on the terraces. Meanwhile, in Australia, the early 20th-century phenomenon of the six o\u2019clock swill \u2013 where patrons drank quickly before pubs shut at 6pm \u2013 encouraged bingeing over bonding, as men rushed to get as many beers down as possible before closing time.\n\n\u201cIn Australia, it was more about getting pissed ... so these cultural elements couldn\u2019t develop over time,\u201d Street says.\n\nIn any case, because of soccer\u2019s position on the periphery of the Australian psyche, the conditions simply did not exist for the British-style singing and chanting tradition to be borrowed or transferred at the moment it could have been. Soccer in Australia was played mostly in those days by post-war migrants from continental Europe and was regarded as a game for \u201cshielas, wogs and poofters\u2033\u2063, in the words of legendary Socceroo Johnny Warren. Aussie rules, the rugby codes and cricket were the dominant sports, defining what was considered Australian and, by extension, un-Australian, forming an institutional atmosphere that was not conducive to the kind of free-form, collective spontaneity that was thriving on the British terraces.\n\nThe line for beers at the Princes Bridge Hotel in Melbourne in 1965, just before closing time at 6pm. Credit: Fairfax Photographic\n\nLong before then, of course, soccer had been abandoned specifically because of its popularity and history in Britain; as illustrated by a letter to the Sunshine Advocate in Melbourne in 1927, some even saw the code as \u201cpart of an organised movement to destroy Australianism\u201d itself. Many British immigrants to Australia also dropped their support for the game upon their arrival, or at least chose not to become engaged with the local scene, and continued to support their \u201chome\u2033\u2063 club from afar. As a result, opportunities for this shift in football fan culture to be adopted more broadly across Australian sport were limited, and to the extent that chanting did (and does) happen in domestic soccer, the influence was probably more European than British.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t believe how quiet it was\u2019\n\nMusic, and singing, does have its place in Australian sport. In the AFL, there are club songs, which fans perform with gusto before every match (and after, if they\u2019re lucky). Written in 1906, Collingwood\u2019s was the first adopted by a then-VFL team, and it contains a relevant lyric, reflecting how barracking had been so broadly embedded that it was considered a basic right: \u201cSee the barrackers a-shouting, as all barrackers should!\u2033\u2063\n\nCertain teams have their own rituals and anthems. Port Adelaide\u2019s fans sing INXS\u2019s Never Tear Us Apart just before the start of home games, while Melbourne Victory\u2019s unofficial theme song is Seven Nation Army by The White Stripes, which was written 700 metres up the road from AAMI Park at the Corner Hotel in Richmond.\n\nNever Tear Us Apart has become a pre-match anthem at Port Adelaide matches. Credit: Getty Images\n\nThere is the newer, American-ish phenomenon of \u201cgoal songs\u2033\u2063, which certain AFL teams play over the loudspeakers after a specific player has kicked a goal, and supporters follow along like a karaoke session. Brisbane Lions star Charlie Cameron\u2019s chosen song is John Denver\u2019s Take Me Home, Country Roads, which has become a feature of their home matches at the Gabba. The crowd sings every word; in the 2023 qualifying final, they had not yet finished when Cameron kicked his second goal within a minute, creating a spine-tingling viral moment.\n\nThere are also occasional exceptions to the rule, like random renditions of Waltzing Matilda and Sweet Caroline here and there, and the odd chant that does take off, like \u2018Ooh! Aah! Glenn McGrath!\u2019 \u2013 but, by and large, as far as making songs there and then, it doesn\u2019t really go beyond the kind of repetitive clap-based chants you\u2019d hear at a high school sports day.\n\nDavid Rowe, emeritus professor at the Institute for Culture and Society, Western Sydney University, is a leading global authority on sport sociology and cultural studies. He is also a lifelong Plymouth Argyle fan, and therefore takes almost personal offence at Australia\u2019s most common sporting chant, \u2018Aussie Aussie Aussie! Oi! Oi! Oi!\u2019 \u2013 which is not only a national embarrassment, but not even original. It\u2019s a direct rip-off.\n\n\u2018Oggy Oggy Oggy! Oi! Oi! Oi!\u2019 has been in use in a British sporting context since as far back as World War II. An \u201coggy\u2033\u2063 is a Cornish pasty, a shortcrust pastry filled with meat and vegetables; the story goes that the vendors selling them used to yell the first part, and their customers would respond with the second. It was then adopted by fans of Plymouth Argyle, the local football club in Devon, and stolen at some point by Australians, gaining widespread popularity during the Sydney 2000 Olympics.\n\n\u201cAustralia hasn\u2019t had that [same] kind of cultural tradition, so they try to borrow it. It often sounds really lame,\u201d Rowe says.\n\n\u201cWhen I came to Australia, I lived quite a few years in Newcastle, and I went to a major grudge match between the Newcastle Knights and the Brisbane Broncos \u2026 I couldn\u2019t believe how quiet it was. My rule of thumb is that a British football crowd of 5000 is noisier than a 20,000-25,000 crowd at Australian rules or rugby league.\u201c\n\nWho do we sing for?\n\nThe most extensive efforts to change this have taken place within Australian soccer.\n\nGrant Muir has been a part of The Cove, Sydney FC\u2019s main supporter group, since the club was founded 20 years ago and has spent most of that time trying to convince Australians to sing along with him. A Scottish migrant, he can recall plenty of examples where he and others have tried to get something going, only to fail miserably.\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cNot every chant is a banger. Sometimes you think you\u2019ve got the best chant ever, and everybody just kind of turns around and looks at you. There\u2019s a lack of willingness to experiment sometimes. It\u2019s that kind of Australian lack of confidence, cultural cringe: if other football fans overseas are doing it, it must be great, but we can\u2019t possibly come up with something that would be as good as that.\u201d\n\nSydney FC\u2019s main supporter group, The Cove. Credit: Getty Images\n\nMuir reckons it\u2019s gotten easier over time, but only in specific circumstances.\n\n\u201cIt very, very, very rarely happens organically, but if you do a chant that intentionally tries to engage people outside of the active support area, it\u2019ll work if it\u2019s done at the right time, if the mood is right,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no point in trying to do it when you\u2019re 4-0 down on a wet Saturday night, but if it\u2019s the right game and the right atmosphere, a call and response chant \u2026 that can work. And once you\u2019ve established the pattern, that it\u2019s OK, it\u2019s not embarrassing, it\u2019s good fun, then it gets easier.\u201d\n\nThe most recognisable example in the A-League of what Muir is talking about \u2013 with all due respect to The Cove \u2013 is courtesy of the Red and Black Bloc, the rival faction supporting the Western Sydney Wanderers. When the Wanderers were born in 2012 and became an instant national sensation, the RBB\u2019s songbook became just as iconic as the team\u2019s hooped home jersey, and this chant in particular, which gets other sections of the stadium involved: \u201cWho do we sing for? We sing for Wanderers.\u201d\n\nThe RBB\u2019s vibe is a blend of continental European and South American influences, and their manner of support is highly orchestrated and coordinated, with a person known as a \u201ccapo\u2033\u2063 usually leading chants and songs \u2013 as opposed to the more spontaneous, improvisational British style, where anyone can come up with something. They are constant for 90 minutes, devoting their bodies to the greater cause of their teams, rather than reacting to what is in front of them.\n\nBut because this kind of behaviour is still culturally foreign in Australia, police and security guards usually seek to shut it down rather than understand it \u2013 while, in turn, active fans light flares and cause mayhem that triggers further clampdowns. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. The A-League can still match the atmospheres in Europe on its best days, but for that, and a number of other reasons, those transcendent moments are fewer and further between.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just a culture thing\u2019\n\nMuir suspects there are other factors underpinning the Australian reticence. The stadiums he grew up attending in Scotland were usually smaller, tighter and fully enclosed, with roofs, amplifying the volume of whatever noise was made by the crowd \u2013 in direct contrast with Australian sporting venues, which tend to be wide-open bowls with no cover. In the A-League, most teams do not come even remotely close to filling the capacity of their home grounds, making it even harder to retain any atmosphere generated.\n\nMuir\u2019s boyhood team was Hamilton Academical, and he watched them play every weekend with his father at a \u201cshitty old stadium\u201d called Douglas Park. Save for a small grandstand with seats for the club\u2019s cashed-up supporters, it was mostly made up of terracing, or standing areas, which was more conducive to singing than sitting down.\n\nThe Anfield Kop as it used to be: full of terracing. Credit: Getty Images\n\n\u201cI think that that had a huge amount to do with it,\u201d Muir says. \u201cPeople stood. Australian stadiums are almost all all-seaters, right?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why choirs stand up.\u201c\n\nWill we ever change? Can we? With so many historical, social and structural factors at play, it\u2019s difficult to imagine a world where Aussie crowds suddenly become singers, en masse, and compete with the Poms on that front. It\u2019s just not in us.\n\nThat\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing; we\u2019re passionate, highly knowledgeable people when it comes to sport, and the absence of singing does not necessarily equate to an absence of tension or atmosphere.\n\nWe\u2019re just wired differently, and that\u2019s OK.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the genealogy of British sports fans to sing at sporting events,\u201d Emmerson says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the way you grow up; it\u2019s just a culture thing. I don\u2019t know how Australia starts that. I don\u2019t know where the creativity comes from.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m available for consultancy, if you want me to help you Aussies with some songs.\u201d\n\nAnother moral victory to England, then. We\u2019ll stick to the real ones, on the field.",

        "text": "For those unfamiliar with the premise, Cats is loosely based on T.S. Eliot\u2019s 1939 poetry book, Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats . Adapted by Andrew Lloyd Webber, the musical forfeits a straight narrative arc, instead choosing to focus on spotlighting various street cats and their idiosyncratic personalities.\n\nThis year marks its 40th anniversary in Australia. Playing not in the Arts Centre, but at Hamer Hall, Cats is the first time a full-scale musical is being staged there. The concert hall, with its superior acoustics, is undoubtedly a purrfect venue to house the likes of more than two dozen supersized felines crawling, prowling, preening, hissing, cavorting and yes of course, singing their furry hearts out.\n\nThis production has far more than nine lives. In fact, Cats is now 44 years old; to mark its grand old age, the show is touring the country and has just returned to Melbourne.\n\nDon\u2019t look too deeply into the plot; there\u2019s some ludicrous guff about an annual meeting of these creatures to determine which one will be chosen to be reborn into a new life. (By what criteria they have to fulfil to be worthy of such an honour is never made clear.)\n\nIf you\u2019re here, it\u2019s probably for the costume, choreography and musical compositions. A fair few in the clowder of cats have their moment in the moonlight, accompanied by a live orchestra, with different musical styles to suit the personality of each character, including rock, jazz and blues tunes.\n\nDes Flanagan as Rum Tum Tugger. Credit: Penny Stephens\n\nAnd though yes, the singing is as strong as expected in a production as famous and long-standing as this one, there\u2019s a certain lack of imagination in having each cat front up and do their bit, before slinking away and allowing another one to have their turn. The rest act as a clamouring chorus. Memory is still by far the best (and most memorable) song in the show, which explains why it\u2019s repeated several times.\n\nAgainst a junkyard set that\u2019s suitably gloomy, with a number of hidey-holes, the cats come out for play. Eliot was inventive with names: there\u2019s Bustopher Jones and Asparagus (both played by Todd McKenney), Rum Tum Tugger (Des Flanagan), Munkustrap (Jarrod Draper) and Old Deuteronomy (Mark Vincent) among the many night marauders.",

Mewis, a 34-year-old former West Ham United player, revealed earlier on a podcast that the pair had discovered the venue almost two years ago.\n\nKerr, who is currently a striker for Chelsea in the Women\u2019s Super League, was photographed as she headed to the villa dressed in a sleek black-and-white suit. She was also holding a baby bottle for her seven-month-old son, Jagger, who reportedly was dressed in a mini matching outfit and who would join Kerr down the aisle later in the day.\n\nGroups of guests, most of whom were dressed in black ensembles, were ferried from Crown Towers to the wedding venue on large buses, including fellow Matildas players Steph Catley, Alanna Kennedy, Caitlin Foord and Mackenzie Arnold, as well as Irish footballer Katie McCabe and Kerr\u2019s brother, Daniel. They were greeted at the venue by a violin and cello duet.",

        "text": "The wobble seam is bowled with the fingers wide of the seam and held loosely, rather than in a conventional upright position. This delivery wobbles in the air. After pitching, the delivery moves in one of three directions: away from the batsman, into the batsman, or it remains along its previous path, without deviating. Bowlers themselves are not even sure about how the ball will move. \u201cNo one really knows whether it\u2019s going to nip or not, and which way it\u2019s going to nip,\u201d former England fast bowler Chris Woakes said earlier this year. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know, the batter doesn\u2019t.\u201d The uncertainty over which way the ball will move makes the wobble seam venomous. Consider two of Boland\u2019s wickets this series. On the third evening in Brisbane, Harry Brook shaped to defend, assuming that the ball would hold its line. Instead, the delivery moved away a scintilla, and kissed the outside edge. On the first evening in Melbourne, Jamie Smith pushed forward to defend, just as Brook had done. This time, the batsman was deceived by a delivery that curved in to uproot his middle stump. Like many of his fellow batters, Marnus Labuschagne has endured some Ashes pain. Credit: Getty Images\n\nLike many supposed modern inventions, the wobble seam is really a reinvention. In the 1990s, Curtly Ambrose, Courtney Walsh and Allan Donald all bowled what would now be known as the wobble seam, using the delivery to try and nullify Sachin Tendulkar. The modern incarnation of the wobble seam was popularised by Australia\u2019s Stuart Clark and Pakistan\u2019s Mohammad Asif in the late 2000s. Observing Asif in 2010 led James Anderson to develop the ball \u2013 to great effect \u2013 in time for the 2010-11 Ashes. In the 15 years since, the delivery has increasingly become the default for leading quick bowlers around the world. Batting \u2018blind\u2019 Physics explains why the wobble seam is so lethal. Facing 130km/h bowling, a batsman has about 0.55 seconds between the ball being delivered and reaching them. This decreases further, to 0.4 seconds, when speeds reach 145km/h. Batsmen must commit to their shot 0.15 seconds before the ball reaches them, as demonstrated by research by David Mann, who has worked with Australian Test batsmen. During the last 150 milliseconds of a ball\u2019s trajectory, a batsman is effectively blind. In this period, batsmen cannot make any further adjustments to their strokes.\n\nWith wobble seam, all the deviation occurs in these 0.15 seconds, when it is too late for batsmen to change their shots. This is why Brook and Smith were both dismissed by Boland\u2019s wobble seam, but by deliveries that moved in the opposite direction. While Mitchell Starc has used swing devastatingly this series, even he now uses wobble seam regularly. Though swing is more alluring than seam, it gives batsmen more visual cues about what to expect, based on how the ball is delivered, and more time to adjust, as the ball movement happens before pitching. Scott Boland\u2019s accuracy has troubled England. Credit: Getty Images From 2017-24, balls that swung more than 1.5 degrees in Tests averaged 23 runs per wicket. Balls that seamed more than 0.75 degrees averaged just 17. Half as much seam, then, is more dangerous than twice as much swing. Unrelenting accuracy\n\nWhile progress is hard to measure precisely in such a multifaceted game such as Test cricket, there is strong reason to think that today\u2019s Test seamers are more accurate than ever before. This observation is not to disparage past greats, but recognise the greater depth of today\u2019s Test attacks, and how they are better equipped to absorb injuries. Even in the absence of two of their three leading seam bowlers, Australia have demonstrated remarkable accuracy: the ability to pound out a good line and length relentlessly, thereby maximising all assistance offered. One finding by CricViz, the data-tracking company, emphasises Boland\u2019s skill. Based on a player\u2019s ability to bowl on both a good line and length, Boland is the most accurate seamer in history, since ball-tracking data was introduced in 2005. This makes Boland more accurate even than Glenn McGrath, when he was recorded at the end of his career. Green pitches\n\nThree millimetres of grass: that was all it took to cause national uproar down under. These three millimetres at the MCG were the difference between the 7mm of grass for last year\u2019s MCG Test against India, a classic that finished in the last throes on day five, and the 10mm for this year\u2019s two-day affair. The MCG\u2019s curator \u2013 to use the nomenclature beloved in Australia \u2013 Matt Page said that he was in a \u201cstate of shock\u201d. The pitch was officially graded \u201cunsatisfactory\u201d by match officials. The opening Test, at Perth, also offered appreciable seam movement to go with bounce. Yet either side of these Tests, batsmen have thrived. Across Brisbane and Adelaide, the teams averaged a combined 34.9 per wicket \u2013 the equivalent of a very healthy 349 being scored in all four innings of the match. The difference between these two Tests and the games in Perth and Melbourne illustrates how greater deviation transforms the dynamics of matches. Batters\u2019 responses Aspects of batting technique this series can justifiably be criticised: at Melbourne, Smith was bowled through an inviting gate between bat and pad. Modern batsmen have far less experience in defending than players of previous generations, before the short-formats mushroomed.\n\nBrook\u2019s response to walking out at 3-8 in England\u2019s first innings at Melbourne showed the very different approach that is today\u2019s zeitgeist. Facing Starc with the new ball, Brook charged down the pitch and attempted a huge swipe that met only thin air. \u201cOh what has he done? Oh dear me,\u201d exclaimed Jonathan Agnew live on Test Match Special, speaking for thousands of English cricket fans. Loading Yet there was method in Brook\u2019s audacity. On a pitch offering such lavish seam movement, his approach aimed to meet the ball before it could deviate off the pitch, and score runs before he encountered a fatal delivery. Remarkably, the English batsman advanced down the wicket to five of his first 15 balls. For all the mocking, Brook\u2019s plan worked. He scored more runs than anyone on either side in the Test, making a total of 59 for only once out. Joe Root adopted a far more orthodox approach, the sort that would be free from criticism if it failed. Yet he still only lasted 53 balls in the Test and made a duck and 15 across the two innings. Perhaps batting techniques have indeed declined. But to see such a high-class technician as Root flounder at the MCG was to be reminded that when bowling is this accurate, on a pitch offering abundant movement, batsmen\u2019s agency in their fate is limited.",
