(Eamon Gallagher)\n\n\"The opposition will continue to scrutinise this legislation carefully, but from what we have seen so far, it looks pretty unsalvageable,\" Ley said during a press conference in Canberra.\n\n\"As it stands, the government's proposal is half-baked and Australians deserve far better.\"\n\nLey's said the opposition's reform package would focus on\ufeff enshrining a definition of \"antisemitism\" in law.\n\nShe again claimed the PM's proposed measures do not address the root issue of the Bondi attack.\n\n\"We have got this bundle of measures heading in many different directions, criticised in a very valid way by a whole range of people, but not actually addressing the issue,\" Ley added.\n\n\"Let's remember why we are where we are. We had the worst-ever Australian attack on Australian soil.\n\n\"Parliament should have been reconvened before Christmas to actually demonstrate leadership, compassion and the determination that I have spoken of every day since to tackle radical Islamic extremism and eradicate antisemitism.\"\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese is facing opposition from the Coalition to his proposed hate speech laws. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nParliament will reconvene early next week to consider the proposed legislation, the draft of which was presented to MPs and senators on Monday.\n\nThe government has said the updates would allow for swifter crackdowns on the kind of speech which Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke has characterised as heretofore antisocial but not illegal. \ufeff\n\nHowever, despite many Coalition MPs condemning Albanese for not acting sooner in the wake of the December 14 attack, \ufeffsome senior figures are now baulking at supporting the proposed bill.\n\nAmong them is leadership aspirant Andrew Hastie, citing a perceived threat to \"democratic freedoms\", including freedom of speech.\n\n\"There's a lot to consider, and very little time in which to do so,\" he said in a video posted to social media.\n\n\"From the top, I'll be voting no to this bill.\ufeff\"\n\nREAD MORE: Major hint Trump is about to unleash new military operation \ufeff\n\nMP Andrew Hastie will vote against the bill.

The Coalition, day after day, very clearly called for parliament to be recalled,\" he told ABC Radio Sydney.\n\n\"Now they're saying this is somehow rushed, even though my government has moved in a considered, orderly way.\"\n\nAlbanese said he had met with Ley regularly in the lead-up to recalling parliament, and that the government was very open to considering amendments.\n\n\ufeff\"We've said we're open to amendments in order to be sure to get this right,\" he said.\n\n\"We haven't heard any proposed amendments.\"\n\nHe urged MPs with concerns or proposed changes to \"pick up the phone\" and \"engage constructively\".\n\n\ufeff\"I'll just say to the Coalition, this should be a moment of national unity, and I say that to the crossbenchers and Greens as well,\" he said.\n\nWith the Coalition set to oppose the bill in parliament, the government would likely need to reach an agreement with the Greens to push the legislation through the Senate.\n\nThe other option would be making alterations to reach a stage where the Coalition could support both the hate speech and gun control laws.\ufeff\n\n9news.com.au has contacted the prime minister's office and attorney-general's office for comment.\ufeff",

Musk arrived in Indonesias resort island of Bali on Sunday, May 19, 2024, to launch Starlink satellite internet service in the worlds largest archipelago nation. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) (AP)\n\nStarlink is banned in Iran by telecommunication regulations, as the country never authorized the importation, sale or use of the devices. Activists fear they could be accused of helping the US or Israel by using Starlink and charged with espionage, which can carry the death penalty.\n\nCat-and-mouse as authorities hunt for Starlink devices\n\nThe first units were smuggled into Iran in 2022 during protests over the country's mandatory headscarf law, after Musk got the Biden administration to exempt the Starlink service from Iran sanctions.\n\nSince then, more than 50,000 units are estimated to have been sneaked in, with people going through great lengths to conceal them, using virtual private networks while on the system to hide IP addresses and taking other precautions, said Ahmad Ahmadian, the executive director of Holistic Resilience, a Los Angeles-based organisation that was responsible for getting some of the first Starlink units into Iran.\n\nFootage from Starlink satellites in orbit. (YouTube/SpaceX)\n\nStarlink is a global internet network that relies on some 10,000 satellites orbiting Earth. Subscribers need to have equipment, including an antenna requires a line of site to the satellite, so must be deployed in the open, where it could be spotted by authorities. Many Iranians disguise them as solar panels, Ahmadian said.\n\nAfter efforts to shut down communications during the 12-day war with Israel in June proved to be not terribly effective, Iranian security services have taken more \"extreme tactics\" now to both jam Starlink's radio signals and GPS systems, Ahmadian said in a phone interview. After Holistic Resilience passed on reports to SpaceX, Ahmadian said, the company pushed a firmware update that helped circumvent the new countermeasures.\n\nSecurity services also rely on informers to tell them who might be using Starlink, search internet and social media traffic for signs it has been used, and there have been reports they have raided apartments with satellite dishes.\n\nA shipment of Starlink user terminals. (Twitter)\n\n\"There has always been a cat-and-mouse game,\" said Ahmadian, who fled Iran himself in 2012, after serving time in prison for student activism.\n\n\"The government is using every tool in its toolbox.\"\n\nStill, Ahmadian noted that the government jamming attempts had only been effective in certain urban areas, suggesting that security services lack the resources to block Starlink more broadly.\n\nA free Starlink could increase the flow of information out of Iran\n\nIran did begin to allow people to call out internationally on Tuesday via their mobile phones, but calls from outside the country into Iran remain blocked.\n\nCompared to protests in 2019, when lesser measures by the government were able to effectively stifle information reaching the rest of the world for more than a week, Ahmadian said the proliferation of Starlink has made it impossible to prevent communications. He said the flow could increase now that the service has been made free.\n\n\"This time around they really shut it down, even fixed landlines were not working,\" he said.\n\nIn this photo obtained by The Associated Press, Iranians attend an anti-government protest in Tehran, Iran, Friday, January 9, 2026 (UGC via AP)\n\n\"But despite this, the information was coming out and it also shows how distributed this community of Starlink users is in the country.\"\n\nMusk has made Starlink free for use during several natural disasters, and Ukraine has relied heavily on the service since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. It was initially funded by SpaceX and later through an American government contract.\n\nMusk raised concerns over the power of such a system being in the hands of one person, after he refused to extend Ukraine's Starlink coverage to support a planned Ukrainian counterattack in Russian-occupied Crimea.\n\nAs a proponent of Starlink for Iran, Ahmadian said the Crimea decision was a wake-up call for him, but that he couldn't see any reason why Musk might be inclined to act similarly in Iran.\n\n\"Looking at the political Elon, I think he would have more interest ... in a free Iran as a new market,\" he said.\n\nJulia Voo, who heads the International Institute for Strategic Studies' Cyber Power and Future Conflict Program in Singapore, said there is a risk in becoming reliant on one company as a lifeline, as it \"creates a single point of failure,\" though currently there are no comparable alternatives.\n\nChina has already been exploring ways to hunt and destroy Starlink satellites, and Voo said the more effective Starlink proves itself at penetrating \"government-mandated terrestrial blackouts, the more states will be observing.\"\n\n\"It's just going to result in more efforts to broaden controls over various ways of communication, for those in Iran and everywhere else watching,\" she said.",

        "text": "In the space of just a couple of points, Jordan Smith went from a relative unknown to a champion on centre court at a grand slam.\n\nThe 1 Point Slam during the Australian Open pitted an array of folks against one another, from tennis legends to random Australian celebrities.\n\nSmith ran the gamut on his way to the $1 million prize on Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday night.\n\n\"It has not sunk in, waking up to just an unbelievable feeling,\" he told ABC News Breakfast.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"Overwhelmed and amazed, just so surreal. It was just amazing to be on court last night.\"\n\nIn a field of 48, Smith started his namesake, Geelong AFL star Bailey Smith, who missed a forehand return. Then came a brilliant rally with women's world number 86 Laura Pigossi, with Smith chancing his arm and coming up trumps when Pigossi's backhand volley sailed long.\n\nThat sent the 29-year-old into a nerve-wracking match-up with two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner.\n\nAsked if he had any advice for his outmatched opponent, Sinner joked: \"Maybe he doesn't need advice if I double fault\", although Smith said he did seek some advice from the pros on the sideline.\n\nTennis battler beats the pros to take home $1 million jackpot Sydneysider Jordan Smith has beaten grand slam champion Jannik Sinner and dual grand slam finalist Amanda Anasimova to take home the prize in the novelty format.\n\n\"They're very friendly and very down to earth,\" he said.\n\n\"They helped me out. I asked a few of them for advice and it was pretty cool to just be around them and enjoy it.\"\n\nBut no advice was required as the Italian superstar hit the net cord with his one and only serve to end the match-up before it truly began, with world number one Carlos Alcaraz courtside to mock Sinner's tight attempt.\n\nNext up was the runner-up from the last two women's grand slam singles finals, world number four Amanda Anisimiova, who didn't get her forehand return back into play after a taxing point to take down Daniil Medvedev.\n\nMen's world number 71 Pedro Martinez, fresh off lifting the trophy at the Bengaluru Challenger event in India earlier this month, was next and sprayed a backhand long after a tentative rally, sending Smith into the final.\n\nOn the other side of the draw, women's world number 117 Joanna Garland had rolled past men's major runner-ups Nick Kyrgios and Alex Zverev, plus Olympic silver medallist Donna Veki\u0107, en route to the decider.\n\nGarland, who just won the WTA Canberra International last week, said the prize money could help fund her on the tour for a couple of years\n\nShe chose to serve but sent her next backhand wide, handing the cash to Smith.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nSmith was speechless on court immediately after the fact, but did say he planned to use the money to buy a house with his partner Jess, who was up in the stands at Melbourne Park.\n\nShe was sitting alongside Smith's parents, Neil and Michelle, who started Smith's love affair with tennis when he was just three.\n\nJordan Smith won the NSW qualifiers for the 1 Point Slam last month. (Supplied: Tennis NSW)\n\nFor more than 30 years they have run the Castle Hill Tennis Academy in Sydney's north-west.\n\nNeil coached Jordan, the youngest of the three, when he won five national junior titles (two singles and three doubles) from 2008 to 2012 before spending a year on the US college scene at Gonzaga on an athletic scholarship in 2015-16.\n\nHomesickness, COVID and the financial difficulties of being a lower-ranked player on tour \u2014 Smith reached a career-high singles ranking of 1,141 in 2023 \u2014 led him back to Castle Hill to coach alongside his dad and brothers Blake and Cameron.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nSmith made it through last month's qualifiers at the North Shore Open to be crowned the NSW state champion.\n\nSmith said his whole family was stunned he made it through the high-pressure tournament. And so was he.\n\n\"I tried to keep it pretty level the whole time, just smile,\" he said.\n\n\"I was going into it thinking I was gonna win one point and it just kept happening and kept getting the points.\n\n\"[I was] just trying to smile as much as I can and just enjoy the moment.\"",

So then I shut the door, and I told the kids, 'Look, we're going to have to go'.\n\n\"As we left the house, a big helicopter launched a water bomb on the house.

(ABC News: Matthew Holmes)\n\nRod Printz, who runs Castlemaine Boutique Accommodation, has 16 bed and breakfast units available for short-term rental, but is considering renting them out long-term at a cheaper rate.\n\n\"We can accommodate up to 140 guests, and we can move people around to accommodate fire people,\" he said.\n\n\" The short term's a hard thing to throw people in immediately, but for the long term, we could put people in for 12 months. \"\n\nMr Printz said it was important for families to stay close to Harcourt so they could continue with work and school commitments while they rebuilt.\n\nThe Giugni family would love a home just like their Harcourt one.\n\n\"We know this is where we want to live. We had a great property in Harcourt, with trees everywhere, it was a dream,\" Mr Giugni said.\n\n\"We were living in the south of France once upon a time, and it brought back some of those feelings and the people were nice.\"",

(ABC News)\n\nThe wages are owed for the work they did on Corrigan's Farm in south-east Melbourne, where lettuces, kale and other salad vegetables are grown for customers, including supermarket giants Coles and Woolworths.\n\nThe workers were employed by a labour hire group run by Cambodian-born Melbourne man Bunchhay San, who is at the centre of an investigation into a network of labour hire companies accused of tax fraud.\n\nInvestigators believe about $60 million from the nine companies has been spirited into the black economy.\n\nCambodian-born Bunchhay San heads up BCS Green Corp in Melbourne.

(Supplied: Instagram)\n\nIn November, Ms Khut told the court she previously worked for 1998 KH Crop but refused to say who gave her the job.\n\nThe court heard that between May and December 2023, she withdrew $5.7 million in cash from the company's six bank accounts.\n\nAsked about a large cash withdrawal of $25,000, she said it was used to pay farm workers.\n\nCambodian government arrests more than 1,000 people in cybercrime raids A crackdown by Cambodian authorities on cybercrime has led to more than 1,000 arrests.\n\nBut she said she had no records of any payments and did not remember the names of any of the company's 70 employees.\n\nAnd she admitted she did not pay the workers directly. Instead, she had given the money to a person she described as \"the driver\" to pass on.\n\nShe repeatedly refused to name this person, even after registrar Tim Luxton directly ordered her to.\n\nAsked why not, she said: \"My reason is because I am a Khmer person and in Khmer community there will be consequences that I and my family will be going through \u2026 our safety is our reason not to be answering that\".\n\n\" I don't know what kind of person that driver is, and if I expose that person's name, there will be consequences that my family will experience. \"\n\nAppearing before the court in January, Mr San said that all of $7.8 million that he withdrew in cash from BCS Green Corp's accounts between May and December 2023 \"was paid to the worker\".\n\nHe admitted to lying to the LHA on an application form for a labour hire licence by saying the company did not pay workers in cash.\n\n\"If you say yes, you wouldn't get the licence,\" he told the court.\n\nHalf of Victoria's vegetables are grown around Melbourne's fringes. (ABC News: Jess Davis)\n\nMr San was questioned in detail about June 14, 2023, when he went to the Chadstone branch of the CBA and withdrew $90,000 and the CBD branch of Suncorp and withdrew an additional $25,000.\n\nAsked what happened to the $115,000, he said he drove to multiple farms around Melbourne and distributed the money to workers.\n\nAsked if he kept any of the millions he withdrew for himself, he said there was never any change.\n\n\"No \u2026 I don't even see that money, I pay to the workers straight away,\" he told the court.\n\n'Vulnerable' workers preyed upon, experts say\n\nLegal scholar Laurie Berg, an associate professor of law at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), said the experiences of Tommy and Susilo echo a broader pattern: underpayment cases in complex food processing supply chains where migrant workers at the bottom have little leverage over the entities at the top.\n\nThe FWO's recent survey of farm labour hire found non-compliance was rife across Australia.\n\nLaurie Berg says some migrant workers are in a \"precarious situation\" as they fear \"being sent home\". (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nBut the worst areas \u2014 earning an \"extreme\" non-compliance rating with 83 per cent of farms and labour hire companies failing to obey the law \u2014 were the Mornington Peninsula and Yarra Valley in Victoria.\n\n\"These are some of the most vulnerable workers in Australia,\" Dr Berg told the ABC.\n\n\"They're on short\u2011term visas in a precarious situation \u2026 fearful of being detected by authorities and of being sent home.\"\n\nDr Berg argued Australia needed stronger accessorial liability so workers could pursue claims \"up the chain\" against entities capable of making good, national labour\u2011hire licensing, streamlined wage recovery, and an expanded Workplace Justice Visa pilot so exploited workers could safely come forward.\n\nWorkplace Justice Visa requirements Migrant worker experts say the federal government needs to expand the number of community organisations accredited to process Workplace Justice Visa claims to reduce pressure on existing providers.\n\nDr Berg said labour\u2011hire arrangements and remote supply\u2011chain relationships had made oversight difficult and accountability scarce.\n\nShe also called for national, harmonised labour\u2011hire licensing and streamlined wage recovery mechanisms because \"the legal system really doesn't work for workers in cases like this\".\n\n\"We need stronger accessorial liability laws that would enable a worker to go up the chain to make their claim.\n\n\"We need stronger labour\u2011hire licensing and stronger visa protections,\" she said.\n\nThe UWU's executive director of farms, Caterina Cinanni, also said the Workplace Justice Visa scheme needed to be expanded to cover workers on bridging visas and undocumented workers \"because they are facing the greatest risk of exploitation\".\n\nShe also argued the Fair Entitlements Guarantee, a scheme that pays entitlements to Australian workers when their employer goes bust, should be extended to cover non-residents.\n\nLaurie Berg says it is hard for farm workers to hold people to account for underpayment. (ABC News: Claudia Jambor)\n\n\"Cash contracting and the exploitation of temporary migrant workers can only be stopped when all workers, regardless of their visa status, are afforded equal protections by our industrial and visa system,\" she said.\n\n\" Workplace exploitation will remain rife when workers are forced to live in secrecy and are too afraid to share all the information about what is happening to them at work. \"\n\n'Even the union couldn't help us'\n\nSusilo and Tommy decided to speak up, despite the risks.\n\n\"I've wanted to for a long time, but to whom?\" Susilo said.\n\n\"We didn't know whom to complain here. Even organisations like the union couldn't help us.\n\n\"The problem is, most of us still work there. And they seem \u2014 not exactly willing \u2014 but they feel like, 'Oh well, let's just keep working and leave that issue.'\"\n\nIn the meantime, the workers have still been waiting to be paid for the work they did putting greens on Christmas tables.",

        "text": "An Indigenous artwork which was made more than 70 years ago has been re-discovered after decades in a trunk at a museum in regional Western Australia.\n\nIt was drawn in 1947 by 12-year-old Claude Kelly, who was part of Australia's Stolen Generation, at Carrolup Native Mission School near the town of Katanning, south of Perth.\n\nThe museum that the artwork was found in is about 200 kilometres away from the Carrolup mission.\n\nThe painting was found in a trunk at the Corrigin Historical Society. (Supplied)\n\nCorrigin Historical Society curator Steve Brown-Smith said the artwork was donated to them about 25 years ago.\n\n\"The curator at the time of the donation died a few years ago so any knowledge that she may have had has gone with her,\" he said.\n\n\"We never displayed the picture, and it has sat, undisturbed, in an old trunk for most of the last 25 years or so.\"\n\nHundreds of pieces of artwork from Carrolup have ended up thousands of kilometres away from where they were created.\n\nEnglish woman Florence Rutter visited Australia in 1949 and was given hundreds of Carrolup pieces to exhibit and sell in London.\n\nAmerican Herbert Mayer held a private collection of 127 pieces which he donated to his school, Colgate University in New York, where they remained in storage until 2004 when they were found by chance.\n\nThe collection was returned to country in 2013 and given to the John Curtin Gallery in Perth.\n\nArtwork through the lens of children\n\nClaude Kelly's artwork is now being cared for at John Curtin Gallery.\n\nThe gallery's senior Carrolup adviser Patricia Ryder said the newly uncovered piece was important for a multitude of reasons, including for families of the artists.\n\n\"This could be some tangible evidence of their family connections that they may not have any more info on,\" she said.\n\n\"The Carrolup artworks talk to a time in history that we are really removed from, and it's important to look at the artworks through what those children would have experienced at the time, not from where we are now.\"\n\nThe Herbert Mayer collection of Carrolup artwork is at the John Curtin Gallery. (Supplied: Craig Mengham)\n\nCarrolup collections officer Lisa Liebetrau said the artworks could be very fragile with paper conservators assisting to restore damaged pieces.\n\n\"The works being made after the Second World War and also on a mission school where the government and the education department were not providing materials of good quality, so the works were made with whatever was available,\" she said.\n\n\"The new acquisitions that we get in, especially the Claude Kelly that we're talking about, that one had a lot of insect damage, it had a lot debris and dust and things like that,\" Ms Liebetrau said.\n\nSearch continues\n\nThe search for the artworks that were created at Carrolup is ongoing.\n\n\"We only know 17 of the artists that have been attributed to their pieces, and with 127 artworks in the Herbert Mayer collection you can see why it's important that we continue to push for the research and education aspect so we can try and fill those gaps,\" Ms Ryder said.\n\nLisa Liebetrau says the art in the Carrolup collection can be incredibly fragile. (Supplied: Brad Coleman)\n\nIn 2022, an exhibition of Carrolup artwork was held in various parts of the United Kingdom to try and find more artwork that could be hanging in homes and galleries over there.\n\n\"Although our hopes would be to have them all back, the reality is, this may not be possible,\" Ms Ryder said.\n\n\"Our goal is to attribute more artists or more families of the artist to these artwork.\"",

        "text": "Alice Springs has long captured the imagination of writers seeking solitude, inspiration and a deeper connection to the Australian landscape.\n\nFrom Nevil Shute's A Town Like Alice to Bruce Chatwin's The Songlines, the central Australian town has served as a literary backdrop for outsiders drawn to the romance and mystery of the desert.\n\nBut today, the stories emerging from Alice Springs are increasingly being written by locals \u2014 many of them Aboriginal \u2014 who are reshaping how Central Australia is represented on the page.\n\nIndigenous stories, in particular, are increasingly being told by Aboriginal authors themselves, across literature as well as art, music and performance.\n\n\"A Town Like Alice and Songlines are both classics and still selling strong, but there are now more books being published, particularly by First Nations authors, telling their own stories of growing up and living on Arrernte country,\" said Bronwyn Druce, manager of Red Kangaroo Books in Alice Springs.\n\nA world-first blak love anthology is coming \u2014 and it's about joy An anthology of love stories written by First Nations people is in the works with stories of blak love, joy, and connection capitalising on the fastest growing literary genre in the world.\n\nRed Kangaroo Books, named Australian Bookseller of the Year in 2023, is the only brick-and-mortar bookshop within a 1,500-kilometre radius \u2014 and it plays a central role in supporting local writers.\n\nAuthor Tanya Heaslip, whose memoir An Alice Girl became a bestseller, says the town now has one of the highest concentrations of writers anywhere in the world.\n\n\"Alice Springs has more authors per head of population than almost anywhere else \u2014 except perhaps Iceland,\" she said.\n\nAccording to Heaslip, this shift marks a move away from what she describes as earlier \"whitefella literature\", which often framed the region through an outsider's lens.\n\n\"Central Australia was sometimes portrayed as mysterious or unknowable,\" she said.\n\n\"But now we're seeing stories grounded in lived experience \u2014 stories that come from the land and the people who belong to it,\" said Heaslip.\n\nThe desert, she argues, continues to exert a powerful creative pull, but the narratives have evolved. Writers in the Red Centre produce poetry, fiction and non-fiction that is deeply connected to place, culture and community.\n\nShe grew up on a remote station and learned to write by listening to the School of the Air. After a career as a lawyer, she returned to her roots.\n\nThere are other reasons authors move here, including convenience, but also the beautiful surroundings.\n\n\"Shorter commutes to work and back home, the wonderful desert landscape, and a slower pace of life, community, give creatives time and space to work on their craft,\" Ms Druce said.\n\n\"Many people have lived here at some point and had books published. Some more well-known authors that have spent time and lived in Central Australia are Alexis Wright, Robyn Davidson, Jennifer Mills, Kim Mahood, and Nicholas Rothwell,\" she said.\n\nThe best books of 2025 An exciting Australian debut, a bevvy of award-winning literary fiction and more than one heart-wrenching memoir are among our critics' favourite reads of the year.\n\nThat shift has been supported by strong local infrastructure. Central Australia is home to its own Indigenous publishing house, alongside an active Northern Territory Writers Centre, which regularly hosts readings and storytelling events \u2014 often outdoors, under the stars.\n\n\"I can only separate non-fiction and fiction. In the kids' top 10, eight books are by First Nations authors and local,\" Ms Druce said.\n\nThat local focus sets Alice Springs apart from other literary hubs, where writers are often drawn to urban settings or darker genres. While crime fiction dominates markets in parts of Europe, Heaslip says writing from Central Australia tends to be shaped more by geography than by genre.\n\n\"There are stories from here about those things too, but mostly our writing is about country,\" Heaslip said.\n\nThe isolation of the region is part of its appeal. Alice Springs sits thousands of kilometres from Australia's major cities, in a landscape once covered by an inland sea and shaped over millions of years.\n\nIt is also a place steeped in Arrernte culture and surrounded by other ancient Aboriginal traditions, and it is convenient for authors.\n\nWhat's Australia's favourite book of this century? We've crunched the numbers behind the Top 100 Books countdown.\n\nFor Heaslip, that combination of remoteness, history and community continues to inspire.\n\n\"I love Central Australia with all my heart,\" she said, \"Its powerful MacDonnell Ranges, hidden valleys, crystal-clear waterholes and vast blue skies fill my soul. But it's also the big-hearted people and the richness of the community that make this place such fertile ground for stories.\"\n\nAs more local voices find their way onto bookshelves, Alice Springs is no longer just a setting for stories written elsewhere. It is becoming one of Australia's most distinctive literary centres \u2014 a place where stories are not only inspired by the desert but deeply rooted in it.",

It was so hot.\"\n\nMarie McGarry lives in the dual-occupancy home with her daughter. (ABC News: Lish Fejer)\n\nDesign challenge\n\nAs climate change brings hotter summers and more frequent heatwaves, experts have said it will be essential to better address the living conditions of apartment dwellers.\n\nIn the largest study of its kind in Australia, researchers are tracking the indoor temperatures, air quality, and window and air conditioning usage in 450 apartments across Sydney, Melbourne, and Queensland over two years to understand how apartment dwellers actually use energy and maintain comfort.\n\nOver the recent heatwave, researchers, led by senior research scientist Pippa Soccio, surveyed participants to find out how comfortable they were in their apartments.\n\nA CSIRO study found air movement was a problem in apartments deemed by occupants to be warm or very hot. (ABC News: Lish Fejer)\n\nThe results showed 25 per cent of participants felt warm or too hot in their apartments, with a lack of air movement the main problem.\n\n\"Very few of [the participants] have ceiling fans,\" Dr Soccio said.\n\n\"It's great to put air conditioning on to cool our homes down, but if we get a heatwave and a power outage and you can't use your air con, then can you open your home?\n\n\"Can you get air moving through, particularly when the cool change comes?\"\n\nOther causes of uncomfortably hot apartments included inadequate shading, ineffective air conditioning or people's choices not to use air conditioning.\n\nLlewellyn McGarry says she has the air conditioning running all day in her Canberra apartment. (ABC News: Lish Fejer)\n\nWindow woes\n\nMs McGarry's experience isn't unique. Across Australia, residents in apartments are sweltering for months each year \u2014 despite meeting building standards\n\nThe hot indoor temperatures were particularly surprising as she had believed her double-glazed windows with a dark tint would have acted as a shield and maintained a comfortable temperature.\n\n\"I thought double glazing was about heating, cooling and noise, but as soon as the sun hits the surface, it actually feels hotter on the inside than it does on the outside,\" Ms McGarry said.\n\n\" You put your hand on it, it's so hot. It feels like it could burn. \"\n\nBut building scientist Peter Lyons said, depending on the climate, glazing could be a trade-off between overheating in summer and free heating in winter.\n\n\"If you've got huge, glazed areas, particularly if they face west and are sheer facades with no shading, then those windows cop a huge amount of solar heat,\" Dr Lyons said.\n\n\"You might actually benefit from some of that solar gain in the winter, but the downside is they are going to be a liability in the summer.\"\n\nMany apartments are designed with floor-to-ceiling windows to maximise light and views. (ABC News: Callum Flinn)\n\nIt is a design flaw repeated across Australian apartment buildings, which is part of the CSIRO's Apartment Energy Behaviour Study.\n\n\"There's a belief, I believe, that more glass gives us more access to daylight and daylight is preferable over artificial light,\" he said.\n\n\"[But] depending on your orientation, more glazing and daylight means more sunlight, which in turn means more radiant heat, which then obviously heats the apartment.\"\n\n\"I think it's great to use glazing, perhaps to frame a view rather than to necessarily capture the entire view,\" Dr Soccio added.\n\nLimited solutions\n\nMs McGarry has installed internal blinds programmed to come down in the afternoon when the sun strikes.\n\nIn the bedrooms, she has added accordion-style blinds with reflective backing fitted into the window frame.\n\nMarie McGarry says her apartment is unbearably hot in summer. (ABC News: Lish Fejer)\n\nShe said the additions had helped, but it was still too hot, and that even when the air conditioner was set to 19 degrees Celsius, the temperature rarely dropped below 24.\n\n\"It has improved in comparison to my mum's, but it's still quite hot in there. It was 30 degrees on Monday,\" she said.\n\nHer energy bills are now costing up to $300 per month, which she said was higher than expected but also a medical necessity as she lives with a disability.\n\n\"As someone who can't regulate my temperature, anything above 24 [degrees Celsius] is actually incredibly uncomfortable, and I get quite ill,\" Ms McGarry said.\n\n\"We were after something long-term, like a forever home, that was going to be suitable to meet everything I needed and what mum needed \u2026 but we're just too hot.\"\n\nLooking across at the new developments around them, Ms McGarry and her mother contemplate the prospect for future residents with floor-to-ceiling glass on all sides.\n\n\"These poor souls, they get the morning sun from this side of the building, and then they'll get the afternoon sun as well, so they'll get it all day and be cooked,\" Marie McGarry said.",

(ABC Rural: Isabella Kelly)\n\nShe drove more than two hours to the Clare Valley Veterinary Clinic, which is unable to provide 24/7 care.\n\nAfter some testing and treatment, Dodge was discharged, but he collapsed again on the way home.\n\n\"At that stage we were almost three hours from Adelaide,\" Ms Crawford said.\n\n\"I got him down there, but they had to put him down.\"\n\nShe had driven 600km at this point, with only Dodge by her side.\n\nMs Crawford is one of 256,306 people without access to a vet in Australia, according to Bronwyn Orr, vet and former president of the Australian Veterinary Association.\n\nThe closest vet for Lisa Crawford's animals is nearly 200 kilometres away. It is another 100km for an emergency vet. (ABC Rural: Isabella Kelly)\n\nAccess to a vet was defined as being within an hour drive.\n\nSophie Browne, director and veterinarian at Clare Valley Veterinary Services, said many of her clients travel.\n\n\"We would probably see six to eight clients a day who have travelled anywhere from half an hour to an hour and a half,\" she said.\n\nShe said an hour could be the difference between life and death.\n\n\"We've had people call from Peterborough (116km away) or Orroroo (130km away) with a snakebite,\" Dr Browne said.\n\nDr Sophie Browne, director and veterinarian at Clare Valley Veterinary Services.

        "text": "A single tree threatens to disrupt US mining giant Alcoa's expansion in Western Australia, with the company under investigation over an alleged breach of its state-imposed mining conditions.\n\nAlcoa \u2014 which has mined bauxite in WA since the 1960s and employs about 4,000 people in the state \u2014 wants to expand further into the world's only jarrah forest, south-east of Perth.\n\nThe proposal is under review by the state's Environmental Protection Authority (EPA), which would typically require a project to stop while it's being assessed.\n\nHowever, the WA government allowed Alcoa to keep mining during the assessment to \"safeguard local jobs\".\n\nAlcoa's special exemption comes with conditions, including a requirement that mining must not occur within 10 metres of mature significant trees, which can provide nesting habitats for endangered black cockatoos.\n\nThe jarrah tree at the centre of an investigation into Alcoa's alleged mining breach. (Supplied)\n\nThe ABC can reveal the Department of Water and Environmental Regulation (DWER) is now investigating an alleged breach of that condition \"as a priority\".\n\nAlcoa denies any wrongdoing, saying it takes its operating conditions \"very seriously\".\n\nBut if the alleged breach is proven, Alcoa could lose its exemption, making it illegal to continue mining while the EPA review is underway.\n\nSingle tree at centre of probe\n\nSatellite imagery of part of Alcoa's Huntly Mine, 100 kilometres south of Perth, shows Alcoa's mining activities around a lone jarrah tree.\n\nSatellite image of part of the Alcoa Huntly mine in September 2019. (Supplied: Nearmap)\n\nSatellite image of part of the Alcoa Huntly mine in January 2023. (Supplied: Nearmap)\n\nOver the past six years, the forest around the tree was cleared, and mined or turned into road.\n\nSatellite image of part of the Alcoa Huntly mine in December 2023. (Supplied: Nearmap)\n\nSome time after December 2023, a rock wall connected to the undisturbed island around the jarrah tree appears to have been knocked down.\n\nSatellite image of part of the Alcoa Huntly mine in August 2025. (Supplied: Nearmap)\n\nBy August 2025, the tree appears to no longer have any leaves.\n\nPolitician trespasses to verify\n\nWA Greens MLC Jess Beckerling said she was alerted to the tree by a concerned member of the public in December.\n\n\"We've unearthed some very compelling evidence that Alcoa appears to have breached its special exemption from WA environment laws,\" Ms Beckerling said.\n\nWA Greens MLC Jess Beckerling. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nShe trespassed through Alcoa's mining lease to try verifying the claims and take photos and videos of the scene.\n\nMs Beckerling measured the distance from the base of the tree to the northern edge of its island \u2014 about 9.1 metres \u2014 which is less than the required 10 metre radius.\n\nSatellite imagery appears to corroborate Ms Beckerling's measurement but also shows a buffer of at least 10 metres at most other angles surrounding the tree.\n\n\"They've blasted through a rock wall ... and it appears that it's that disturbance which has caused this suspected breach,\" she said.\n\nShe referred the matter to the environmental regulation department, which has since confirmed it's investigating the alleged breach.\n\nWA Greens MLC Jess Beckerling measured the diameter of the tree, and the distance to an edge of the unmined land. (Supplied: Jess Beckerling)\n\nThe department would not provide a timeline for how long the investigation could take.\n\n\"It would not be appropriate to make further comment while the investigation is ongoing,\" a DWER spokesperson said.\n\nIn a statement, Alcoa said it had applied a 10-metre buffer around the tree since it was identified in 2014 pre-mining surveys.\n\n\"Mining took place at various times until March 2024. None of this activity breached the applicable 10m buffer zone,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"The tree was not identified as a black cockatoo nesting tree.\n\n\"Alcoa takes the conditions governing our operations very seriously and we consider that we are operating in accordance with the section 6 exemption order.\"\n\nDefending trespass\n\nAsked about whether it was appropriate for an elected member of parliament to knowingly break the law by trespassing, Ms Beckerling said she was motivated by a sense of public duty.\n\nJess Beckerling defended her trespassing onto Alcoa property. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\n\"I have a responsibility to do what I can to protect the Northern Jarrah Forrest from this strip mining,\" she said.\n\n\"I was very cautious in the way that I went about finding this information. I waited until the end of a non-work day. I was certain that there was no mining activity occurring.\"\n\nMs Beckerling said she was not suggesting anyone should follow her example.\n\n\"It's not my place to encourage or discourage other people to do what they think is right,\" she said.\n\nUnique arrangements\n\nAlcoa is exempt from most of the state's environmental laws and is instead governed under state agreements, which allow it to mine in WA's state forest.\n\nA government committee reviews the company's five-year mining plans which are implemented on a rolling basis to allow continuity in Alcoa's operations.\n\nAlcoa's mining footprint between 1984 and 2022. (Supplied: Google Earth)\n\nHowever, environmental protection laws do not allow a project to be implemented while it's being assessed by the EPA.\n\nTo prevent disruption, the WA government declared an exemption order allowing Alcoa's operations to continue despite the EPA assessment.\n\nWA Premier Roger Cook said at the time the exemption was necessary to protect thousands of jobs, which would be put at risk if Alcoa needed to stop its operations.\n\nAlcoa has mined in WA for bauxite, used to create aluminium, since the 1960s and employs about 4,000 people. (Supplied: Landgate)\n\nThe exemption order limits where and how much the company can mine, including the requirement to avoid mining near significant trees.\n\nIf those conditions are found to not have been met, the exemption ceases to have effect, meaning it would become illegal for Alcoa to continue any of its operations which are being assessed by the EPA.\n\nIn a statement, Alcoa reiterated its commitment to \"working responsibly to balance environmental and social considerations\".\n\n\"We continue to enhance protections for environmentally significant areas, including proposing to apply a 30m buffer around known and suitable black cockatoo nesting trees, significant trees, and night-time roosting trees,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"We continue to work with regulators, third-party consultants, and researchers to maintain our commitment to continuously improving our approaches.\"",

        "text": "Volunteer fire brigades and regional communities across Western Australia's heartland are being forced to self-fund expensive satellite equipment, as mobile drop-outs continue to impact bushfire fights.\n\nWidespread mobile blackouts during bushfires across the Wheatbelt in December were the latest example of firefighters left unable to communicate after mobile towers lost power.\n\nBut in the Shire of Victoria Plains, around 160 kilometres north-east of Perth, a recent decision to fit Starlink units to five of the local fire brigade's trucks left communications intact.\n\nFirefighters battled a five-day blaze which went through the Mogumber Mission in December. (Supplied: Department of Fire and Emergency Services)\n\nThe units allow for the vehicles to access high-speed internet through the Elon Musk-run company's low-earth orbit satellites, at the cost of $20,000 for the installation.\n\nChief Bushfire Control officer Gavin Halligan said the units were the only way responders were able to communicate outside the fire ground during the five-day firefight near Mogumber.\n\n\"We managed to get choppers in, speak to DFES ... and keeping logistics up like water tanks on certain roads,\" he said.\n\nStarlink units have been fitted to several volunteer bushfire brigade vehicles. (Supplied: Shane Hart)\n\nThe units' effectiveness has seen more country councils following suit, with the neighbouring Shire of Dandaragan planning to purchase two or three more units.\n\nFurther north, the Shire of Coorow is installing 10 Starlink units on its fire response vehicles, with help from a local gas company to meet the $30,000 price tag.\n\nCoorow Shire president Guy Sims said the region's history of poor mobile communications made the move unsurprising.\n\nCoorow shire president Guy Sims says the new technology is essential. (Supplied: Shire of Coorow)\n\n\"Starlink is still a relatively new technology, but it's a technology that's proving itself,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's going to become pretty well essential from now on.\"\n\nIncreasing reliance\n\nThe move continues a national trend of public and private consumers relying on Starlink for their internet and mobile services.\n\nThey include WA's Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) which said its cache of Starlink units are \"dispatched as required\", including to the recent Midwest fires.\n\nThe increasing reliance on Starlink in Australia has drawn criticism about its unpredictable owner, Elon Musk. (Reuters: Mike Blake)\n\nAt least 375,000 Starlink units were connected across the country last year, according to federal government data.\n\nThe increasing reliance on the service within Australia has drawn concern about its potential to make the country more vulnerable to the whims of its unpredictable owner.\n\nBut Dandaragan Shire president Tony O'Gorman said reliable communications were the paramount concern.\n\n\"I think we all have concerns about Elon Musk,\" he said.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is it's the only technology that is available at the moment, and I will put the safety of our firefighters ahead of any idealisms that people have.\"\n\nShire of Dandaragan shire president Tony O'Gorman says Starlink provides a reliable extra line of communication. (ABC News: Briana Shepherd)\n\nIn Coorow, Community Emergency Services manager Mick Antony said volunteers were increasingly dipping into their own pockets to install the units.\n\n\"Communication is the highest priority, as well as the actual fire-fighting,\" he said.\n\n\" Everyone needs to be alerted. We need to get that information out. \"\n\nStarlink directly competes with the Australian government's NBN satellite option.\n\nStarlink, which is owned by controversial billionaire Elon Musk, has become increasingly popular in regional communities. (ABC Midwest & Wheatbelt: Chloe Henville)\n\nHowever, the \"Sky Muster\" product will soon be replaced with a new Amazon satellite product, following a partnership between the tech giant and NBN.\n\nAn Albanese government spokesperson said it supported a competitive communications market and was investing to make mobile connectivity more resilient across regional Australia.\n\nFunding shortfalls\n\nWith the state government not currently funding brigades' Starlink purchases, local governments are having to find other funding methods.\n\nIn a recent state budget submission, the WA Local Government Association said volunteer bushfire brigades across the state were short $42 million in unmet grant requests.\n\nBushfire Volunteers Association executive officer Shane Hart says volunteer brigades need more funding for appropriate vehicles and equipment. (Supplied: Shane Hart)\n\nHowever, Bushfire Volunteers Association executive officer Shane Hart said it was a symptom of a broader funding problem.\n\n\"Many local governments still don't have the sustainable funding to purchase or maintain the equipment brigades need,\" he said.\n\n\" Eligibility is not the main problem, the funding model is. \"\n\nA state government spokesperson did not address questions about funding, but pointed to $69 million granted to local governments for bushfire mitigation since 2017.",

First, it shows the possibility of two major blocs reaching a broad trade agreement, not just about trade, demonstrating that cooperation is possible.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU Mercosur Trade Agreement passed the European Parliament last week - a development hailed by Latin American signatories.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe headline exports in question involve farms, cars and minerals.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent tariffs can be as high as 35 per cent for auto parts and cars or 28 per cent on dairy products.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving these tariffs would save approximately $4 billion and are to take effect gradually, with a timeline dependent on the specific product.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazilian Vice President Geraldo Alckmin says it would promote investment and result in \"cheaper and better quality products\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A win-win situation, that is, cheaper and better quality products. So, wherever it's more competitive, it sells. We are more competitive in the sector, we export; the other is more competitive in another sector, we buy. Society benefits with cheaper and better quality products.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the deal is not considered a \"win-win\" by all parties in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition has been fierce, particularly in the lead-up to the EU Parliament vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, Greek farmers said they would be severely hurt by a free trade deal with South American nations.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany staged blockades with tractors across major motorways, with farmer Vasilis Theodouru condemning the government over what he says is an already-dire situation for the nation's farmers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThere is a wider problem in all of Europe with the Mercosur program, with what will happen with Ukraine. It is foreseen that products from third world countries will enter Europe and destroy prices of European products, which means that our survival is hanging by a thread.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIrish, Polish and French farmers followed suit, with the chief concerns including food safety and that the deal would see 99,000 tonnes of cheap beef come from South America.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Vall, who works with Brazilian Economic Institute FGV-IBRE, says that scenario would almost certainly be prevented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No trade agreement fully liberalises a country\u2019s commerce - they always preserve more sensitive products. In Europe\u2019s case, those are clearly agricultural products. So while there will be greater market access for meat, which is our main interest, it will never be total.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deal would fuel Europe's struggling auto industry, which is predominantly German, with South American countries representing a growth market for cars.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to the bloc's economy and has been struggling under developments including Donald Trump raising tariffs on European imports.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis week, he reiterated his commitment to U-S domestic car manufacturing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We want to make them here. And that's what's happening. Everybody's moving here. From Canada, they're coming here. From Mexico, from Japan, from Germany, from all over the world, they are coming here, they're opening up their plants.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOn both sides of politics, French politicians have been scathing of the Mercosur deal, this week criticising President Emmanuel Macron for not fighting harder to prevent it.\n\n\n\n\n\nMathilde Panot of the Unbowed Party is in rare agreement with her conservative party counterparts in this assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, officially, France voted against the European Union-Mercosur agreement. But this superficial opposition doesn't make anyone forget eight years of participation in the negotiations during which Emmanuel Macron did nothing to prevent or block anything. You bear full responsibility for this humiliation.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout the support of two key member states, and with major reservations from more than 100 politicians, the EU Commission president's signature this weekend does not guarantee when or if the agreement comes into motion.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "One of Australia's top literary festivals has issued a fresh apology and invited a Palestinian-Australian author to its 2027 edition after her controversial removal generated a massive backlash.\n\n\n\n\n\nRanda Abdel-Fattah was dumped on 8 January from the Adelaide Writers' Week line-up in a board decision, triggering a mass boycott by 180 speakers and the resignation of its renowned director and several board members.\n\n\n\n\n\nWriters' Week, which was due to start in February, was entirely canned after its program collapsed, with a new board and chair installed.\n\n\n\n\n\nA re-issued apology on Thursday comes after the former Adelaide Festival board cited \"cultural sensitivity\" after the Bondi terror attack in cancelling the author's appearance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" We retract that statement. We have reversed the decision and will reinstate Dr Abdel-Fattah's invitation to speak at the next Adelaide Writers' Week in 2027,\" the new board led by immediate past chair of the Adelaide Festival, Judy Potter, said on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We apologise to Dr Abdel-Fattah unreservedly for the harm the Adelaide Festival Corporation has caused her.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Intellectual and artistic freedom is a powerful human right. Our goal is to uphold it, and in this instance Adelaide Festival Corporation fell well short.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe board belatedly apologised to Abdel-Fattah on Tuesday for how the decision was represented, citing \"a continuing rapid shift in the national discourse around the breadth of freedom of expression\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt approached Abdel-Fattah on Wednesday evening about the fresh apology and the request to attend in 2027.\n\n\n\nRanda Abdel-Fattah to consider invitation to next year's festival\n\nThe author told the Australian Associated Press she would consider accepting the invite to next year's festival confirming she would attend in a \"heartbeat\" if respected publisher Louise Adler was at the helm again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I accept this apology as acknowledgement of our right to speak publicly and truthfully about the atrocities that have been committed against the Palestinian people,\" she said in a statement given to the Australian Associated Press..\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I accept this apology as a vindication of our collective solidarity and mobilisation against anti-Palestinian racism, bullying and censorship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I accept this unreserved apology as acknowledgement of the harm inflicted on our community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Palestinian Australian academic and novelist had faced scrutiny over social media posts critical of Israel.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern , British novelist Zadie Smith, author Trent Dalton, commentator Jane Caro and former Wallaby turned columnist Peter FitzSimons were among those who pulled out in solidarity with the academic.\n\n\n\n\n\nHer axing was supported by South Australian premier Peter Malinauskas who remains steadfast in his position despite mounting criticism of political interference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I have a responsibility to call out those who expressly commit themselves to deny other people a voice as Ms Abdel-Fattah has done,\" he told ABC's 7.30 program on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdel-Fattah has accused him of unleashing a \"vicious personal assault\" suggesting at a press conference that she was an extremist terrorist sympathiser.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe has flagged defamation proceedings against Malinauskas over the press conference comments.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Every day, we make choices. Cereal or eggs for breakfast. Whether to take the train or the bus. Whether to accept being made redundant \u2026 or brutally top anyone in the way of the job you want.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat last choice, at least, belongs to No Other Choice, the latest film from acclaimed South Korean director Park Chan-wook.\n\n\n\n\n\nPark, known for films including Oldboy (2003), The Handmaiden (2016) and Decision To Leave (2022), has spent more than two decades probing the dark side of humanity and its thirst for revenge, power and pleasure (often with a healthy dose of blood and psychological mindf-ckery).\n\n\n\nLee Byung-hun (Squid Game) is Man-su \u2014 a devoted company man who is laid off ... and takes an interesting path to get back into the job market. Source: Supplied / Mubi With No Other Choice, releasing in Australian cinemas on 15 January, Park turns his gaze to a quieter, more existential horror: what happens when a person's job \u2014 and the identity bound to it \u2014 disappears.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film follows Yoo Man-su (played by Lee Byung-hun), a devoted company man laid off after 25 years at a paper factory. What begins as a familiar story of redundancy soon spirals into desperation. After a year of unemployment, Man-su decides to confront the job market head-on \u2014 by murdering his competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrutal as it is, the story's logic is unmistakable. Park has spent decades exploring what makes people break, especially when systems and circumstances push them to the edge.\n\n\n\nWhat do you devote your life to?\n\nAt its core, No Other Choice examines the idea that work gives life meaning \u2014 a theme Park says resonated with him more deeply than he initially expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I first heard about this story, I thought it would have nothing to do with me because it's about paper manufacturing, which felt so far from my life and from filmmaking,\" Park tells SBS News via a translator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But after finishing the story, I was very surprised at how easily I was able to empathise with it. There are quite a few similarities between paper manufacturing and filmmaking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Paper is something that most people look down on. They very easily crumple it up and throw it away, but then there are special kinds of paper that people do value, like bills or passports.\"\n\n\n\nPark Chan-wook is a giant of world cinema. His latest film, No Other Choice, explores the horrors of work. Source: Supplied / Mubi He explains that for some people, film and TV are viewed similarly, as \"a meaningless source of entertainment\" or \"a way to kill time\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut for others, works of film and television can be very precious \u2014 even life-changing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Which is, of course, the kind of works that filmmakers strive to make as well,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that's why I was able to very easily empathise with the characters and the story, because it's a story about someone who has devoted their life to something that other people don't consider very important.\"\n\n\n\nA distinctly Korean pressure\n\nThe film is adapted from Donald Westlake's 1997 novel The Ax, which also follows a family man eliminating his rivals in a shrinking job market.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Park reworks the story through a distinctly Korean lens, sharpening its focus on class, familial obligation and the pressure to provide.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile anyone who has experienced redundancy may notice a recognisable anxiety soaking through the film, Park says the story is particularly emblematic of Korean society's relationship with work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Living in Korean society, I'm constantly thinking about and surrounded by the devastating state of people who have lost their jobs. Modern Koreans, especially, have become slaves of their jobs,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They spend most of their time at their jobs and they find the achievements from their job as their life's achievements as well.\"\n\n\n\nDirector Park says the film was inspired by the real-life devastation of job loss in modern South Korean society. Source: Supplied / Mubi Park notes that South Korea's social welfare system was introduced relatively late \u2014 and in stages over the 40 years leading up to the early noughties \u2014 intensifying the consequences of domestic job losses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Up until a few years back, people would be placed in a very hopeless state if they lost their jobs,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We would hear about people who would kill their family after they lost their job and then eventually also kill themselves because they had no hope for the future.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThose real-world tragedies also influenced his 2002 film, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I remember feeling very shocked by news articles about that,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Reading The Ax, I was remembering those incidents and I think I was influenced by the societal circumstance around me as well.\"\n\n\n\nPressure to perform\n\nDespite his global acclaim and having a spate of international awards and accolades, including a BAFTA and multiple awards at Cannes Film Festival, the director remains acutely aware of how success operates within filmmaking \u2014 not simply as validation, but as leverage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The sad characteristic or fate of filmmaking is that you can't do it alone,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So unlike composing music or drawing a picture, it requires a lot of people and a lot of money to make.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And unlike other artists like painters or poets, filmmaking requires you to care about what others might consider worldly desires \u2014 such as box office scores or awards or good reviews.\"\n\n\n\nWhile he's one of South Korea's most acclaimed filmmakers, Park Chan-wook still says he needs \"worldly success\" to be able to continue his career. Source: Getty / John Phillips Despite his influence on global cinema, Park has never been nominated for an Academy Award.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe previously described it as \"hypocrisy\" to pretend awards don't matter. Not because they define artistic worth, but because they can determine whether the next film gets made.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I make films that require a certain level of capital to be invested. I also want creative freedom when I'm making my films as well,\" he says.\n\n\n\nSo I can't help but accept that I also require the so-called worldly success in order to continue in my career.\n\nIt's an understandable concession: an award can come with more power, more creative freedom, and bigger budgets.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust look to Bong Joon-ho, the other globally-renowned titan of South Korean cinema, whose career skyrocketed after his film Parasite won multiple Academy Awards, including best picture \u2014 the first non-English language film to do so.\n\n\n\nStream free On Demand The Handmaiden Watch Park Chan-wook's 2016 thriller-romance The Handmaiden on SBS On Demand. Watch Park Chan-wook's 2016 thriller-romance The Handmaiden on SBS On Demand.\n\nThat win brought more eyes to Bong's work and with it, more trust, manifesting in funding \u2014 a reported $150 million for his following project, Mickey 17.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn No Other Choice, the paper company operates as an invisible authority, quietly determining Man-su's value. For filmmakers, Park suggests, the industry can function in much the same way.\n\n\n\nA 'bitter taste' in a world without film\n\nIn that sense, the film is also a meditation on identity and purpose \u2014 and the forces that shape them.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Park, it's in part an opportunity to reflect on his sense of self and who he is outside of filmmaking.\n\n\n\nI actually thought about that a lot while working on this film and I realised that I have to work on expanding other areas of my life other than just being a filmmaker.\n\n\"Working on my identity as a member of my family and also as an independent individual as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut when faced with the prospect of his vocation being taken away, as it is for his protagonist, Park is deeply introspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I guess if I were to imagine a world in which I wouldn't be able to make films, it leaves a very bitter taste in my mouth.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNo Other Choice is in Australian cinemas now.\n\n\n\n",

Got it Share A A A\n\nCommuters face about another eight weekend closures of parts or all of Sydney\u2019s M1 metro line to allow for testing of trains and other work on the final section of the rail project between Sydenham and Bankstown before it opens. As high-speed testing along the final stage ramps up, a metro train travelled the entire length of the 66-kilometre M1 line from Tallawong to Bankstown via the city, stopping at all 31 stations. The train reached speeds of 100km/h on the final section between Sydenham and Bankstown. Southwest Metro project director Alia Karaman said about eight weekend shutdowns of parts or all of the existing M1 line would be required to complete the final stage. A metro train passes Transport Minister John Graham, left, and other ministers and officials on a platform at Wiley Park station on Thursday. Kate Geraghty \u201cIf we don\u2019t shut down, then it means we\u2019re not able to complete a critical part of the work,\u201d she said. \u201cThe number [of shutdowns] will vary depending on the functionality that\u2019s required, the events and the weekend that we are targeting.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMetro services will not run on the M1 line between Tallawong and Sydenham this weekend, as well as January 24-25, to allow for systems testing. At least four weeks\u2019 notice will be given to commuters of other weekend closures. The final stage between Sydenham and Bankstown was to be opened in late 2025 after a 12-month shutdown of the old heavy rail line, but was later delayed until the second half of this year. Workers toil away on a platform at Wiley Park station on Thursday. Kate Geraghty Under the original plans of the previous Coalition government, the south-west section was meant to open in 2024 at the same time as the rest of the second stage between Chatswood and Sydenham. Transport Minister John Graham declined to give a target date for the opening, reiterating that it would be in the second half of this year. \u201cWhen we can be more specific, we will be,\u201d he said on Thursday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile describing the full-length train trip as a breakthrough for the project, Graham said there was no way to convert the existing heavy rail line between Sydenham and Bankstown to metro train standards without some disruption to commuters. Related Article Exclusive\n\nSydney Metro How cost of Sydney\u2019s main metro station skyrocketed beyond secret forecasts \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of testing to go. There will be more disruption ahead. We\u2019re warning that on the 17th and 18th of January, and the 24th and the 25th of January, the metro line will not be operating so that we can do this important work,\u201d he said. Coalition transport spokesperson Natalie Ward said Graham should explain when the final section of the M1 line would actually open. \u201cLabor told commuters they\u2019d be riding this metro in September last year. It\u2019s now January 2026, and they\u2019re still waiting,\u201d she said. The latest phase of high-speed testing of trains requires a minimum of 9000 hours and 30,000 kilometres of combined testing to be completed before the M1 line\u2019s final stage opens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbout 79 per cent of work in the corridor in Sydney\u2019s south-west and at stations has been completed. Tiling is largely finished at four stations and is progressing at the other six on the final section, while painting and landscaping are underway at most stations. Related Article Sydney Metro Sydney\u2019s three metro rail projects blow out by more than $6 billion Testing is also well progressed on the platform screen doors and 170 mechanical gap fillers, and the latter has passed its first round of tests at every station. The installation of the gap fillers to platforms at eight stations has added complexity to the operation of driverless trains. The small hydraulic platforms extend to the metro carriages before screen doors open, ensuring commuters can safely step on and off when the line opens. The cost of completing the final stretch between Sydenham and Bankstown has blown out the cost of what was formerly known as the Metro City and Southwest project to as much $23 billion, from a previous forecast of $21.6 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe price tag of the city and south-west sections is now more than double the original forecast of about $11.5 billion last decade. Combined with the $7.3 billion cost of the first stage from Tallawong to Chatswood, which opened in 2019, the price tag for the entire 66-kilometre line is now $30.4 billion.

Got it Share A A A\n\nWashington: The American writer at the centre of claims of hypocrisy involving the Adelaide Festival says he did not withdraw from the 2024 event of his own volition but was uninvited by organisers, who told him \u201cthe timing\u201d would not work. Thomas Friedman\u2019s account lends weight to claims by former festival board member Tony Berg, who said then Adelaide Writers\u2019 Week director Louise Adler pressured the board into removing Friedman from the program over a column he wrote about the Middle East. Thomas Friedman, the three-time Pulitzer-winning columnist for The New York Times, said he did not withdraw from the writers\u2019 festival. New York Times Friedman, a three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The New York Times, said he was invited to appear at the literary festival two years ago via Zoom from his home in Washington. \u201cI agreed. A few days later, I was told by email that the timing would not work out. I said, no problem. End of story. That is all I know,\u201d Friedman, who is Jewish, told this masthead.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe subsequently confirmed he did not elect to withdraw from the event, and that festival organisers did not mention his writing on the Middle East when they told him the timing was unworkable. Friedman would not supply this masthead with a copy of the correspondence to which he referred. But his account stands in contrast with a 2024 letter from the Adelaide Festival board that rejected a petition to cancel Friedman over his writing and claimed he was not appearing due to scheduling issues. The board\u2019s response to the petition, dated February 9, 2024, and signed by then chair Tracey Whiting, read: \u201cAsking the Adelaide Festival and Adelaide Writers\u2019 Week to cancel an artist or writer is an extremely serious request. We have an international reputation for supporting artistic freedom of expression. \u201cHowever, I have been advised that due to last-minute scheduling issues, [Friedman] is no longer participating in this year\u2019s program.\u201d That phrasing implied Friedman might have withdrawn from the festival amid the worldwide controversy over a column he had authored days earlier, on February 3, 2024, in which he used the animal kingdom as a metaphor to discuss the geopolitics of the Middle East.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriedman\u2019s account \u2013 that he was effectively uninvited, with \u201ctiming\u201d the stated reason \u2013 lends weight to recent comments by Berg, who told this masthead that Adler pressured the board to cancel Friedman\u2019s appearance, and threatened to resign if it did not agree. \u201cIn the face of that threat, the board felt it had no alternative but to withdraw the invitation to Friedman,\u201d Berg said on Tuesday, accusing Adler and Palestinian writer Randa Abdel-Fattah of extreme hypocrisy. Former Adelaide Writers Week director Louise Adler, who resigned saying she could not tolerate silencing writers. Eddie Jim At the time, pro-Palestine activists, including Abdel-Fattah, were petitioning the festival to remove Friedman from the program over his animal kingdom column. Adler did not deny Berg\u2019s allegations in comments to this masthead yesterday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAbdel-Fattah on Sunday, in an interview with Guardian Australia, rejected allegations of hypocrisy, saying she and the petition writers were concerned about the impact of Friedman\u2019s writing on socially and historically marginalised people. Meanwhile, Abdel-Fattah has sent a legal concerns notice to South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas over comments he has made about her. Malinauskas has said through a spokesman that the Adelaide Festival board removed Friedman in 2024 and that he, as premier, supported the cancellation of both Friedman and Abdel-Fattah. Berg quit the board in October last year, before the Bondi Beach terrorist attack and the current scandal around Abdel-Fattah, citing Adler\u2019s \u201cvendetta against Israel and Zionism\u201d. In his resignation letter at the time, seen by this masthead, Berg referred to the Friedman incident \u2013 though not by name. He claimed Adler had cancelled a writer \u201con the grounds of alleged inappropriate description of Middle East countries and organisations, even when many of the pro-Palestinian writers she has programmed have said and posted much worse things about Israel and Zionists\u201d.",
