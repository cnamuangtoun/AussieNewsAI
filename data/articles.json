        "text": "Australian retailer Kmart broke privacy laws in its collection of customers' data through facial recognition, the Privacy Commissioner has found.\n\nAustralia's Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind found the company had collected personal and sensitive information from customers over a period of two years under the guise of trying to identify people committing refund fraud.\n\nThe technology was used at 28 of its stores around the country.\ufeff\n\nKmart used the facial recognition technology between 2020-2022. (Getty)\n\nHowever, Kind found Kmart did not adequately inform shoppers of the technology being used or seek consent to use facial recognition technology to collect their personal information, which is in breach of the Privacy Act.\n\nKmart had argued that it was not required to obtain consent because of an exemption in the Privacy Act that applies when organisations reasonably believe that they need to collect personal information to tackle unlawful activity or serious misconduct.\n\nKind disagreed in the finding handed down today.\n\n\"The sensitive biometric information of every individual who entered a store was indiscriminately collected by the facial recognition technology system,\" her finding read.\n\n\"There were other less privacy-intrusive methods available to Kmart to address refund fraud.\"\n\nKind also found the fact the technology collected the data of thousands of customers not suspected of retail fraud meant the collection of information was \"a disproportionate interference with privacy.\"\n\n\"I do not consider that the respondent (Kmart) could have reasonably believed that the benefits of the facial recognition technology system in addressing refund fraud proportionately outweighed the impact on individuals' privacy,\" Kind added.\n\nREAD MORE: Jimmy Kimmel yanked off air over Charlie Kirk comments\n\nCarly Kind's findings conclude a three year investigation into the matter. (Edwina Pickles)\n\nThe finding ends a three-year investigation by the Privacy Commissioner, with the ruling stating Kmart had been cooperating with authorities.\n\nKmart said they were disappointed by the finding, arguing their trial of facial recognition technology was limited and used to quell theft and anti-social behaviour against staff in store.\n\nThe company also said it took measures to protect the privacy of customers.\n\n\"\ufeffWe implemented controls to protect the privacy of our customers. Images were only retained if they matched an image of a person of interest reasonably suspected or known to have engaged in refund fraud,\" a Kmart spokesperson told 9News.\n\n\"All other images were deleted, and the data was never used for marketing or any other purposes.\"",

        "text": "Hours after Ben and Jerry's co-founder Jerry Greenfield resigned from the ice cream company he founded nearly five decades ago, his former business partner, Ben Cohen, revealed to CNN why Jerry felt he had to leave.\n\n\"Jerry has a really big heart, and this conflict with Unilever was really kind of tearing him apart. So he felt like he had no choice to resign,\" Cohen told CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich.\n\n\"Jerry's kind of sad that it's come to this, but part of him is feeling a sense of relief that he's no longer in this intense conflict.\"\n\nJerry Greenfield, left, and Ben Cohen, co-founders of Ben and Jerry's, in September 2024, in Philadelphia. (Lisa Lake/Getty Images/File via CNN Newsource)\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Greenfield shared on social media that he was quitting the ice cream company, accusing parent company Unilever of curtailing Ben and Jerry's ability to speak out on social and political causes, which is synonymous with the brand's identity.\n\nThe conflict between the co-founders and Unilever has erupted into public view over the past several years, resulting in lawsuits and publicly posted letters.\n\nBritish-based Unilever bought Ben and Jerry's ice cream for US$326 million ($490 million) in 2000 but allowed the company to operate independently and continue its social mission without interference from its new parent company.\n\nREAD MORE: Jimmy Kimmel yanked off air over Charlie Kirk comments\n\nBen Cohen, co-founder of Ben and Jerry's, poses with a sign as he protests against the Magnum Ice Cream Company earlier this month. (Shokirie Clarke/Handout/Reuters via CNN)\n\nCohen and Greenfield remained at the company, which they founded in 1978, but not in operational roles. Instead, they focused on the company's social missions.\n\nBut Cohen told CNN that as management at Unilever turned over, no one who signed the deal with Ben and Jerry's remains, and the conglomerate started to disrespect the terms of its unique arrangement with the ice cream maker. Tensions boiled over in recent years as Ben and Jerry's opted to pull its operations from Israel, a decision that was overruled by Unilever.\n\nSince then, the company and its parent have feuded, mostly over politically focused social media posts that Cohen said Unilever opposed \u2013 and threatened to fire people over.\n\nREAD MORE: Sheriff reveals why Charlie Kirk suspect turned himself in\n\nBen Cohen said he supported Greenfield's decision to leave the business. (Shokirie Clarke/Handout/Reuters via CNN)\n\nSpeaking out on political issues, ranging from President Donald Trump to Israel and the Gaza Strip, angered Unilever, which fired the company's chief executive earlier this year.\n\nUltimately, Greenfield had enough. But Cohen said he chose to stay to continue to fight for the company's independence.\n\n\"I'm glad that we're both standing up for the values of Ben and Jerry's,\" Cohen told CNN.\n\n\"I think that I can be most helpful from the inside and and Jerry's going try to be helpful from the outside.\"\n\nDespite Greenfield's exit, Cohen said he is committed to the independent board that helps control the brand and will work to convince its parent company to sell the brand to a group of investors committed to Ben and Jerry's social mission.\n\nREAD MORE: The Epstein files question the FBI Director refused to answer nine times\n\nBen and Jerry's is a brand known for its social activism. (Chris Ratcliffe / Bloomberg / Getty Images)\n\nBen and Jerry's is currently being spun off from Unilever into a new company called The Magnum Ice Cream Company, which expects to be publicly traded in November.\n\nThe Magnum Ice Cream Company in a statement said it disagrees with Greenfield's and Cohen's perspective, and said it has tried to work with the brand's co-founders.\n\n\"We remain committed to Ben and Jerry's unique three-part mission \u2013 product, economic and social \u2013 and remain focused on carrying forward the legacy of peace, love, and ice cream of this iconic, much-loved brand,\" a Magnum spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nPolitics is profit\n\nA major factor in Cohen's remaining at the company is to keep intact Ben & Jerry's three-part mission: a social mission to support justice and equality, along with a product and financial mission. He says all three are core to the brand \u2013 and claims it's good for business.\n\n\"When we came up with that three part mission, we deliberately wrote it horizontally to make the statement that they are all equally as important,\" he said.\n\n\"As the company acts on its social values and as it produces great ice cream, it ends up making a good profit.\"\n\nUnilever, which doesn't break out Ben and Jerry's sales separately, said in its 2024 annual earnings report that its ice cream division rose 3.7 per cent from the year before.\n\nCohen doesn't regret maintaining its political and social stances, saying that Ben and Jerry's products have a small portion of the market so \"we don't have to appeal to everybody.\"\n\n\"The reality is that businesses are incredibly political,\" he said.\n\n\"The average business, (are) using their money to influence elections, and they're using their money and their lobbyists to influence legislation.\"\n\nHe added: \"The only difference is that Ben and Jerry's political aspects are overt, where we let people know what we think, whereas other businesses are covert.\"\n\nEven with Greenfield leaving the company, the \"spirit of Jerry will always be at Ben and Jerry's,\" Cohen said. And their friendship, which reaches back to junior high when they were the \"two, slowest, fattest kids\" in their class, will endure.\n\n\"I was a failure as a potter. Nobody would buy my pottery. Jerry was a med school reject, and we got together when we were 26 and said, 'Let's try starting a little business. Maybe that'll work.' We ended up starting this homemade ice cream shop in an old gas station in Burlington, Vermont, on an investment of US$8000 ($12,027) and we had no plans to be anything larger than that,\" Cohen said.\n\n\"It's been an amazing ride. It's been an amazing adventure, an amazing odyssey. There's been good times, there's been bad times, there's been challenging times, and we've been through them all together, Jerry and myself, and it's just built a stronger bond between us.\"",

        "text": "Charlie Star is an eight-year-old poodle with a major case of FOMO.\n\nHis owner Josie Ure is delighted by the news of an Australian-first trial by a major airline to allow pets on flights.\n\nVirgin Australia announced yesterday that it would begin the trial on flights from Melbourne to the Gold and Sunshine Coasts next month.\n\nA limit of four dogs or cats weighing under 8 kilograms will be allowed on permitted flights.\n\nFive quick questions about Virgin Australia's pet policy Photo shows Two air hostess lie next to a dog wearing a pilot costume. The announcement that Virgin Australia will soon be letting small animals onto flights has some pet owners excited to bring their furry friends on holidays, and others concerned about health matters. Here are five quick questions answered.\n\nMs Ure said it was challenging finding suitable pet-sitters when booking a holiday.\n\n\"Our puppies are like our little humans,\" she said.\n\n\"It's very costly because you need to find someone to look after your dog, which can be more than what your holiday costs.\n\n\"He has a lot of anxiety if he is with a stranger and I can't put my puppy into the kennels because he wouldn't cope.\"\n\nNot excess baggage\n\nSunshine Coast pet owner Bree Logie said it was \"about time\" Australia caught up with the rest of the world.\n\nAnimal behaviourist trainee Bree Logie says she also has concerns about dog interactions on flights. (Supplied: Bree Logie)\n\nShe has hopes that bigger dogs will be included in the future.\n\n\"Being a big dog owner, the service probably won't benefit me. But I really am excited for small dog owners,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm training to be an animal behaviourist and I do have to say there are some positives and negatives to everything.\n\n\"The welfare of the dogs needs to come first if it's a stressful environment for the dog.\n\n\"If the dog's not trained in obedience and it's not a comfortable experience for the travellers then that's not a good outcome.\"\n\nAircraft cleanliness\n\nWhile Ms Ure supported the idea of her pooch Charlie Star riding shotgun, the logistics were yet to be tested.\n\nShe said her dog gets distressed easily and she expected there will be challenges with the trial.\n\n\"If he is within a 20-metre radius of another dog he will react and try and take it down. [He] is happy to take on big dogs,\" she said.\n\n\"There could be an issue if there were other pets on the plane.\n\nDog owner Josie Ure thinks the airline may face some challenges with the dog passenger trial. (Supplied: Josie Ure)\n\n\"The other issue is they would have to clean the dog areas very well because there is nothing worse than sitting down and you've got dog hair everywhere.\n\n\"Then there are people who don't wash their dogs very well and it smells of dog.\n\n\"I think it's a great idea, but I can just see a few issues arising.\"\n\nTourism tick\n\nSunshine Coast tourism bosses hope the announcement will boost visitor numbers.\n\nVisit Sunshine Coast chief executive Matt Stoeckel said the new policy removed a barrier for pet owners.\n\nMatt Stoeckel said the opportunity will attract pet owners to the region. (Supplied: Visit Sunshine Coast)\n\n\"It's a step in the right direction, people treat their pets like family,\" he said.\n\n\"If you're a little pooch in Melbourne, why wouldn't you want to come to the Sunshine Coast?\n\n\"The [$149] cost is probably more affordable than kennels.\"\n\nPet pilot set for take-off\n\nThe first flights will commence on October 16 with the trial running through to the end of January.\n\nPets must be secured in a pet carrier which must be stowed under the seat in front of the owner for the duration of the flight.\n\nVirgin Australia plans to run the trial from October to the end of January. (Adobe Stock)\n\nA medical officer for the company Kelly Bofkin said the airline had taken a rigorous approach to addressing allergy and hygiene considerations.\n\n\"We have looked to best medical evidence, worked with other airlines who currently carry pets and consulted with peak allergy bodies in developing our policies and procedures,\" Dr Bofkin said.\n\n\"Our aircraft are fitted with advanced HEPA [High Efficiency Particulate Air] filtration systems, which capture more than 99 per cent of airborne particles, including pet dander.\"\n\nThe company said it would use the trial to obtain feedback before rolling out the service across its domestic network next year.",

(Supplied: Meat and Livestock Australia)\n\nMLA's global supply analyst Tim Jackson said the cow market was running hot because the world was facing tight supplies of lean beef.\n\n\"Around the world a lot of countries are short in terms of production of lean beef,\" he said.\n\n\"American cow slaughter has been falling for quite some time and in the first half of this year was down 10 per cent year on year.\"\n\nAt the Wodonga saleyards on Tuesday, bidding for heavy cows was \"keenly contested\" and reached up to $4.60 a kilogram.\n\nMeanwhile the \"highlight\" of the sale at Eucha this week were heavy cows reaching $4.74 a kilogram.\n\nUS demand escalating\n\nIn its latest market report, the US-based Steiner Consulting Group said tight supply was creating \"ever escalating prices for lean beef\", with the US relying increasingly on imports from Australia.\n\nThis is despite Donald Trump's 10 per cent tariff.\n\nIt said the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) was forecasting beef imports to reach 5.36 billion pounds (2.43 billion kilograms) in 2025, which was 15.7 per cent higher than last year.\n\n\"If this forecast proves correct, it would imply that beef imports in 2025 will outpace US beef exports by around 2.7 billion pounds [1.2 billion kilograms],\" it said.\n\nBetween January and July the United States imported 1.5 billion kilograms of beef with Brazil the largest supplier, followed by Australia.\n\nBut US President Donald Trump has since enforced a 50 per cent tariff on Brazilian imports bringing that beef trade almost to a halt.\n\nThe benchmark CME Feeder Cattle Index has hit a record high. (ABC Landline)\n\nUS cattle prices at 'crazy' levels\n\nWade Christensen from Kimball Livestock Exchange in South Dakota said black feeder steers sold this month for a record 375 cents a pound, fetching $A5,309 each ($US3,513).\n\nABC Landline estimates similar cattle would have sold at Roma in Queensland last week for over $2,200.\n\nAustralian cattle prices are on the rise, but still way below the US. (ABC Landline)\n\nMr Christensen said after years of drought the US cattle herd was at its lowest level since the 1950s and he felt the nation's herd rebuild had not started in earnest and would not happen quickly.\n\n\"Everybody is really confident [in the US cattle industry], but it's also scary times the amount of money we're dealing with to try and buy back [and rebuild herds],\" he said.\n\n\"When you've got young calves off the cow costing $US2,500 a head and the current interest rate, you've got a lot of risk.\"\n\nMr Christensen said cattle prices in the US were at \"crazy\" levels.\n\n\"[We've got a] super short supply of cattle,\" he told ABC Landline.\n\n\" It's hard to believe the demand for beef, people just want more of it and are willing to pay whatever it takes. \"\n\nA report by CoBank in the United States backs up the sentiment by Mr Christensen, showing demand for US beef is soaring despite the rising price.\n\n\"US beef is attracting more customers than it can handle,\" report author Brett Earnest wrote.\n\n\"Even at record prices, demand has not softened \u2014 it has actually edged upward.\"\n\nWatch ABC TV's Landline at 12:30pm on Sunday or on ABC iview.",

        "text": "Not even two years ago, Collingwood was in dire straits. The club had missed AFLW finals for the first time in five seasons and bid goodbye to coach Steve Symonds.\n\nA fresh start was on the cards, but that was always going to mean taking a big step backward to prepare to move forward. So, it was not a huge surprise when the Pies finished as wooden spooners in 2024, but the Sam Wright influence was already clear in his first season as head coach.\n\nNow, Collingwood's newly established game style is bearing wins, not just seeds of hope.\n\nMid-season upsets shake up AFLW ladder Photo shows Ashleigh Richards of the Saints celebrates kicking a goal. After a tough start to the year, Geelong sit just outside the top eight and equal on points with the reigning grand finalists.\n\nThe Wright style has been crucial to the club's rise back up the ladder, as have the changes to the squad.\n\nSince Wright took over ahead of the 2024 season, the Pies have debuted seven players and handed club debuts to a further six players. With the turnover of almost half the list, they have started to establish more balance in the team picked each week.\n\nNumber-one draft pick Ash Centra is arguably the highest profile of their new names, but fellow draftees Violet Patterson, Lucy Cronin, Amber Schutte and Georgia Clark have all made significant strides in the early parts of their careers.\n\nThey have also added two Irish rookies in Muireann Atkinson and Kellyann Hogan, while established players Kalinda Howarth, Airlie Runnalls, Lily-Rose Williamson, Mikayla Hyde, Annie Lee and Carly Remmos have been heavily leant on.\n\nNotably, many of these players are helping to fill out lines at each end of the ground \u2014 two areas Collingwood has struggled in over recent years.\n\nAtkinson, Cronin, Schutte, Lee and Clark all provide significant strength behind the ball, while Centra, Howarth, Hyde and Williamson are becoming increasingly reliable forward options.\n\nDefensive style\n\nIn 2025, Collingwood is conceding two fewer goals per game compared to its leaky 2024 performance, and notably kept juggernaut side North Melbourne to 58 points \u2014 its second-lowest score of the season to date.\n\nLast year, the Pies gave up scores of 50 or more on six occasions from 11 starts. This year, that has happened just once in six games.\n\nTightening the screws down back 2024 2025 Avg points against 50.3 36.4 Avg shot efficiency conceded (%) 47.0 35.3 Avg goal efficiency conceded (%) 20.5 13.6\n\nThis sort of positive shift doesn't simply come down to those in the backline, although the likes of Cronin, Atkinson, Schutte, Lauren Butler and Tarni White have been impressive this year. What the Pies have done particularly well is execute pressure in tight across the full length of the ground, to force skill errors from the opposition.\n\nIt is exactly this which helped the Pies establish control against Sydney on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"Collingwood's pressure was good,\" Sydney coach Scott Gowans said following the round five loss to the Pies.\n\n\"It was off the back of fumbling, so once we fumbled, what it does is it puts perceived pressure on, and perceived pressure turns into the opposition being able to close you down \u2026 I felt like we just invited their pressure and once you do that, and you do win the ball, everything's going to be messy and scrappy.\"\n\nThat pressure game compounds as games wear on, causing increasing panic and skill error, upon which Collingwood can capitalise.\n\nAnother essential part of this defensive game has been the development of Collingwood's aerial contest. Ruck Imogen Barnett has been a key part of this, thanks to her contested marking, helping drive the club's average up this year.\n\nThat strength in the air has meant they are more adept at trapping the ball in dangerous positions, starving sides of opportunities in attack, and piling the pressure on opponents' defensive units.\n\nAttacking style\n\nWith the defence increasingly reliable, the next piece of the puzzle is hitting the scoreboard. This is an aspect that is still very much in development for Collingwood, but the club has made some significant strides this year, nonetheless.\n\nControl and attack 2024 2025 Avg points for 22.3 28.6 Avg marks 35.7 50.6 Avg uncontested possessions 98.9 135.0 Avg inside 50s 26.0 29.2 Avg marks inside 50 3.4 7.6\n\nNew duo Howarth (five goals) and Centra (four) sit atop the Pies' goal-kicking chart this year, waxing and waning as two very different forward options.\n\nFormer Sun Howarth is the crafty mid-sized option, who is a neat hit up on the lead, and is dangerous around forward stoppage, while Centra \u2014 although splitting her time between the midfield and forward line \u2014 is a powerful marking target ahead of the ball.\n\nIt is not simply the ability to get the ball forward more that has been notable for the Pies this year, it is the quality of those entries that has shifted. Collingwood has more reliably chained possession, and knows how to move the ball into space, opening up the forward 50.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nExiting defence with kicks down the line, the next option for the Pies is generally a hit-up kick into the middle of the ground, rather than persisting with long kicks down the line to plenty of numbers.\n\nIt has allowed them to maintain control in-game and be more thoughtful about how they choose to enter attack, giving their forwards far better looks.\n\nConverting that attacking movement into reliable scoring is the last part missing for the Pies.\n\nNevertheless, Collingwood's development has been fast \u2014 and impressive \u2014 in its first seasons under Wright, and after seriously challenging Melbourne, standing up to North Melbourne, and beating Sydney in the last three weeks, round six opponent Hawthorn will now know that the Pies are not the easybeats they once were.",

If that's me, I'm done'. I looked down and my toes were nearly touching my knee.\"\n\nDoctors told Butler the broken bones cut through his calf muscle like a knife.\n\nWhat followed was the \"longest five minutes of my life\" as the small forward desperately sought the green whistle, then had to wait well over an hour for an ambulance to take him from Box Hill City Oval to hospital.\n\nIt took eight months for Butler to fully recover from surgery, leaning on injured teammates Mitch Lewis and James Blanck for support in Hawthorn's rehabilitation group throughout the process.\n\nIn that time, Butler had to learn to walk again before taking gradual steps back into football, rebuilding belief in his ability as he eventually returned through the VFL.\n\n\"I've got a lot of confidence this year, but when I was coming back from the injury I had to work on that side of it a lot,\" Butler said.\n\n\"First contact stuff, even on those bags that you do before training, that was nerve-racking.\n\n\"Elevating different types of contact training was tough mentally.\"\n\nAlmost a year to the day after the injury, Butler returned with four goals in his VFL comeback.\n\nSam's brother Dan (left, with Jack Riewoldt) won a premiership with the Tigers in 2017.

        "text": "The night before her father, Paul White, died at home in northern New South Wales, artist Vicki White captured an image of his bare feet, tangled in the sheets of his bed.\n\nIt was April 2024, the 84-year-old was terminally ill with cancer and Ms White was by his bedside at her childhood home at Taree with her family.\n\nMr White had been sick for more than five years with cancer.\n\n\"Dad was peacefully asleep... and one sister whispered to me, 'Look at Dad's feet. It looks like one of your paintings' \u2026 and I leant over and took a photo,\" she said.\n\nMs White said another sister came up with the title for the image, which reflected that her dad was \"Tethered to Earth\" for one final night.\n\n\"It felt like Dad was just holding on,\" she said.\n\nMs White said her dad's final hours were challenging and emotional, before he died peacefully the next day.\n\nThe photo came to symbolise a powerful moment in the family's palliative care journey.\n\nVicki White says she captured Tethered to Earth the night before her dad died.

        "text": "Retail giant Kmart broke privacy laws by using facial recognition technology (FRT) on its customers, the privacy commissioner has found.\n\nOver the two years until July 2022, Kmart captured the facial data of \"tens or hundreds of thousands\" of customers at store entrances and return counters, in an attempt to tackle refund fraud.\n\nFacial recognition technology maps a person's unique facial features and compares them against a database of other faces.\n\nMajor retailers and public venues say the technology can be helpful in detecting repeat offenders and preventing crime.\n\nBut after a three-year investigation, privacy commissioner Carly Kind found Kmart's use of FRT was disproportionate, and the company did not gain consent to use it on shoppers.\n\n\"The sensitive information of every customer who entered a relevant store was indiscriminately collected by the FRT system,\" Ms Kind said.\n\nHow Kmart used FRT on customers\n\nKmart's \"pilot program\" began in mid-2020 and expanded across 28 stores in all Australian states and territories except for the Northern Territory and Tasmania.\n\nIt would crosscheck facial data of customers against a database of people who had committed refund fraud or were suspected of it.\n\nIn its response to the regulator earlier this year, Kmart argued it was not required to obtain consent because of an exemption in the Privacy Act that applied when organisations reasonably believed they needed to collect personal information to tackle unlawful activity.\n\nMs Kind rejected that argument, finding Kmart could have taken more effective and proportionate security steps rather than FRT, which she described as \"partially suitable\" to prevent fraud at best.\n\n\"The number of fraudulent incidents detected \u2026 and the value of fraud prevented \u2026 was small,\" she said.\n\n\"[It was] also minimal with respect to [Kmart's] annual revenue, which was $9.2 billion in the 2020 financial year.\"\n\nMeasured against the impact on customers, Ms Kind said Kmart's decision to indiscriminately collect biometric information was \"disproportionate\".\n\n\"The potential harms generally arising from the use of FRT are significant, and include the risk of commercial surveillance, discrimination, [and] unlawful [or] arbitrary arrest,\" she added.\n\nAs part of the finding, Kmart has been ordered not to repeat the practice in the future, and will have to publish a statement on its website within 30 days explaining its use of FRT and the regulator's finding against it.\n\nFRT is not banned in Australian stores\n\nIt is the second time in just under a year the privacy commissioner has made a similar finding against an Australian retailer.\n\nIn October 2024, the privacy commissioner found that Bunnings also breached the Privacy Act with its use of FRT in 62 stores, although she said Kmart's use of the technology was very different.\n\nBunnings in breach of privacy laws, Commissioner finds Photo shows A graphic shows a woman's face and the Bunnings Warehouse shopfront in the background The Privacy Commissioner finds Bunnings Warehouse interfered with the privacy of its customers by using facial recognition without consent in 63 of its stores over a three-year period.\n\nThe regulator's decision on Bunnings is currently under review by the Administrative Review Tribunal.\n\n\"These two decisions do not impose a ban on the use of FRT,\" Ms Kind said.\n\n\"Customer and staff safety, and fraud prevention and detection, are legitimate reasons businesses might have regard to when considering the deployment of new technologies.\n\n\"However, these reasons are not, in and of themselves, a free pass to avoid compliance with the Privacy Act,\" she said.\n\nThe privacy commissioner said Kmart stopped its use of FRT when the investigation began in July 2022, and had cooperated throughout the process.\n\nKmart considering appeal\n\nKmart told the ABC in a statement it was disappointed with the Privacy Commissioner's determination and is reviewing its options for appeal.\n\n\"Like most other retailers, Kmart is experiencing escalating incidents of theft in stores which are often accompanied by anti-social behaviour or acts of violence against team members and customers,\" a company spokesperson said.\n\nKmart said images were only retained \"if they matched an image of a person of interest reasonably suspected or known to have engaged in refund fraud.\n\n\"All other images were deleted, and the data was never used for marketing or any other purposes.\n\n\"Kmart remains committed to finding tools to reduce crime in our stores, so we deliver on team member and customer safety.\"",

(Melbourne Youth Orchestra: David Ng)\n\nNorthey is in demand across Australia's biggest stages and over the ditch in New Zealand where he's been chief conductor of the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra since 2015.\n\nHe's stepping down at the end of this year, but there's no shortage of his involvement with major orchestras across Australia.\n\nNorthey attributes a huge part of his success to the opportunities he received while being in the Melbourne Youth Orchestra, an extracurricular activity he took back in high school.\n\nYouth orchestras around the country are getting ready for their annual Big Busk on Saturday September 20, performing live in public spaces in Melbourne and Sydney, with other cities taking part later in the year.\n\nWe talked to Northey and other alumni about what being in a youth orchestra meant for them and their careers.\n\nWhat it's like being in a youth orchestra\n\nYouth orchestras provide young musicians the opportunity to learn instruments, form friendships and open doors to some of Australia's biggest stages. (Melbourne Youth Orchestra: Christine Tan)\n\nAcross Australia, youth orchestras have supported musicians for decades. Some draw members from state-wide networks, while others focus on local neighbourhoods.\n\nThe Melbourne Youth Orchestra (MYO) has been running since 1967. A similar organisation was started in Sydney in 1973. If you do an internet search, chances are, there's a youth orchestra organisation near you.\n\nThe outer-suburb orchestras run by mums Photo shows Four people wearing puffy micky-mouse-ears headbands, playing violins while looking at their scores on the music stands. Here's how a group of mums are ensuring kids in Sydney's outer suburbs have access to the musical opportunities they deserve.\n\nThese orchestras consist of several subgroups which cater to skill level and genre preference.\n\n\"[It's equivalent to] a state athletics championship or a junior level state league,\" Northey explains.\n\nNorthey joined MYO in the mid 1980s. He became a soloist playing the saxophone, touring all over Victoria as well as playing concerts in the US and UK.\n\n\"Every Saturday morning, my mum used to drive me down to Melbourne [for rehearsals] from Ballarat where we lived,\" he remembers.\n\nBeing part of the youth orchestra gave Northey high-level training as an ensemble player at a pivotal age.\n\n\"[I realised] I was one of those people who became really committed to doing music as a career,\" Northey says. \"It enabled me to focus on music at a much deeper and higher level.\"\n\nWhen he switched from being a soloist to conducting, Northey returned to MYO and worked with the next generation of musicians.\n\nProviding equal opportunities to access music\n\n\"MYO was founded by educators who realised that music is important for people to immerse themselves in, no matter what kind of status they have,\" says Taj Aldeeb, one of ABC Classic's youngest presenters and recent graduate of MYO.\n\nAldeeb's family moved to Melbourne from Syria when she was 14, and music has been one of the ways she continues to connect with her old and new cultures.\n\n\"I brought with me the values and the culture that I grew up with,\" Aldeeb says. \"The more I was able to experience that here, the better I feel.\"\n\nTaj Aldeeb says being in a youth orchestra gave her the chance to perform on Melbourne's biggest stages. (Melbourne Youth Orchestra: Christine Tan)\n\nAt the age of 24 and while still studying piano at university, Aldeeb auditioned to join MYO as a percussionist, a growing interest of hers.\n\nBefore she knew it, \"I became the head of percussion,\" Aldeeb says.\n\n\"A few months in, I walked to the conductor and mentioned we didn't have a leader for the percussion section,\" Aldeeb recalls. \"He said, 'All right, you got it.'\"\n\nMusicians can join the youth orchestra for an intensive two-week program during the school holidays, or they can opt to be involved for the whole year.\n\nHowever long or short their involvement, Aldeeb says \"they might get as much of an experience of developing skills, not just technically, but also community and friendships and teamwork and discipline.\"\n\nAldeeb had to leave the orchestra when she turned 25, the general cutoff age for youth orchestras. But she will always cherish her time with the MYO, especially the opportunity to work within some of Melbourne's biggest stages.\n\n\"The mini-Taj would not have imagined that I would be performing in Hamer Hall at a young age,\" she says. \"Becoming a part of MYO made that happen.\"\n\nOpening doors to world-leading orchestras\n\nAnother youth orchestra alum, double bassist Phoebe Russell, remembers heading to Berlin at the age of 17 to play with one of the most prestigious orchestras in the world: the Berlin Philharmonic.\n\nMusicians in youth orchestras have the chance to learn and play advanced symphonic repertoire, some requiring hundreds of people to play their parts.\n\n\"In my last couple of years at MYO, we basically played a lot of the professional repertoire that I tackle in my career every day,\" Russell says.\n\nRussell remembers performing Ravel's Daphnis et Chloe at her last youth orchestra concert and then playing the same piece of music for her first appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic.\n\n\"I was suddenly thrown into the world of professional music making, but I felt comfortable because I'd done seven years of Melbourne Youth Music Camp,\" Russell says.\n\nPhoebe Russell's career started in youth orchestras as a child and teen, took her to the Berlin Philharmonic and today she's Principal Bass of the Queensland Symphony. (Supplied: Phoebe Russell / QSO: Peter Wallis)\n\nRussell has been playing the double bass since she was eight, and with her siblings she attended weekly rehearsals and summer camps.\n\nNow 31, Russell is the principal double bassist at the Queensland Symphony Orchestra in Brisbane, where she's also in several chamber music ensembles, a soloist and a lecturer.\n\nShe remembers one conductor from her youth orchestra days in particular.\n\n\"One of my very early memories of youth music camps was working with conductor Benjamin Northey,\" she says.\n\nThey were recently reunited at a Queensland Symphony Orchestra concert Northey conducted.\n\nRussell reflects: \"I've been playing with him since I was 10 or 11.\"\n\nThe impact of Russell's time with the youth orchestra reaches far beyond the professional spheres.\n\n\"The memories of playing music with your friends when you're really young stays with you for life,\" she says.\n\n\"My brother and I often talk about music that we made together. He's not a musician anymore, but it's still such a big part of all of our lives.\"\n\nThe Big Busk is happening on Saturday, September 20 in various locations across Sydney and Melbourne.\n\nGet the latest classical music stories direct to your inbox",

You don't get to choose every time,\" she said.\n\n\"So no regrets, not really. I just thought India were pretty good today in all facets of the game, and we probably got outplayed a little bit, but it's good to have these opportunities heading into do-or-die World Cup matches.\"\n\nAustralia lacked the spark that Phoebe Litchfield had provided in the opening match with her sizzling innings of 88, as she missed the match with a low-grade quad strain.\n\nSmriti Mandhana hammered the Aussie bowlers to all parts. (Getty Images: Pankaj Nangia)\n\nHer replacement, Georgia Voll, was bowled out for a duck by Renuka Singh in the first over, and Australia then got bogged down amid some fine bowling by Kranti Goud, who got the key wicket of Healy (9) amid her haul of 3-29.\n\nEarlier, Mandhana had been severe on Australia's attack, and had it not been for the accurate off-spin of Ash Gardner, the target would have been even higher.\n\nGardner took 2-39 in her 10 overs, the only Aussie bowler to concede less than four an over.\n\nYoung fast bowler Darcie Brown was also impressive, taking three late wickets (3-42) as India went on a late charge.\n\nTahlia McGrath enjoyed a good day in the field, dismissing Mandhana and running out Goud, but when the all-rounder got caught for 16 off the spin of Deepti Sharma, who took 2-24 to go with a breezy knock of 40, Australia's hopes were sunk.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

MPS: -0.3%),\" he notes. \"That puts the magnitude of the decline on par with what we saw at the start of last year's recession and leaves GDP 1.1% below its year-earlier level.\"\n\nSurya says a collapse in manufacturing output was the key culprit, while construction activity also slumped 1.8%.\n\nWhile services activity was essentially unchanged compared to the first quarter, six out of 11 industries within that sector shrank.\n\n\"What's more, timely data suggest that the economy is going nowhere fast,\" Surya warns. \"Indeed, we learnt earlier this week that BusinessNZ's composite PMI fell back to a three-month low in August and it is on past form consistent with annual GDP growth remaining firmly negative this quarter.\"\n\nHe believes the RBNZ will need to respond with even bigger rate cuts.\n\n\"The sharp decline in output last quarter puts a bumper 50bp cut in play for the RBNZ at its October meeting,\" he argues. \"Risks to our forecast for a terminal rate of 2.5% are also tilted to the downside.\"\n\nTo bring you up to speed, New Zealand acted early and aggressively to raise rates in response to the post-COVID inflation breakout.\n\nIt's central bank (the RBNZ) took rates as high as 5.5% before starting to cut them in August last year.\n\nThe cash rate in New Zealand currently sits at 3%, which is now lower than the RBA's benchmark rate of 3.6%. Rates in Australia only peaked at 4.35%, and Australia has not had a post-COVID recession.\n\nLate last year, I wrote an analysis piece about what was (at that point in time) NZ's second recession in two years. Today's numbers seem to confirm it's core idea, that the RBA's slow-and-steady 'narrow path' approach to getting inflation down worked much better than the RBNZ's rates sledgehammer.",

(We\u2019ve collated their Age footballer of the year votes, the coaches\u2019 votes and Champion Data projections.) And if you\u2019re looking for a roughie, look through our experts\u2019 tips. Zach Merrett, anyone? McClure thinks so, and that could be awkward. Here are the latest odds Nick Daicos $2.50\n\nBailey Smith $5.00\n\nJordan Dawson $6.50\n\nNoah Anderson $7.00\n\nMatt Rowell $13.00\n\nNasiah Wanganeen-Milera $51.00\n\nCaleb Serong $67.00\n\nTom Green $67.00\n\nHugh McCluggage $81.00\n\nMarcus Bontempelli $101.00\n\n(Via Sportsbet, as of Thursday morning.) The leading contenders, round by round\n\nDawson won The Age footballer of the year award and led Adelaide\u2019s stunning rise from 15th to the minor premiership (before a straight sets finals exit). He earned maximum coaches\u2019 votes in five matches and will be tough to beat. Daicos is the popular choice among Age experts. Seven of our 10 tipsters expect him to win, and Champion Data has him best on ground in nine matches. That\u2019s 27 votes right there. Catch him if you can. Anderson powered Gold Coast to September for the first time. He\u2019ll compete with Rowell for maximum votes in plenty of matches.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to look away when Smith is in action, on and off the field. He shared the AFL coaches\u2019 gong with Anderson and made the All-Australian team in his first year at the Cats. \u201cBazlenka\u201d for the Brownlow? Wanganeen-Milera, the AFL\u2019s first $2 million man, will make the leaders sweat when he surges in the final rounds. Party at the Espy if he wins it.\n\nCaleb Serong started strongly but had to cope with taggers for much of the season. However, recent history shows the Fremantle midfielder polls well and should be in the mix. What our experts are saying Jake Niall 1. Jordan Dawson\n\n2. Nick Daicos\n\nRoughie: Jeremy Cameron\n\nLoading Dawson stood out in a team without midfield star power. Daicos is a machine and will get close again, while Anderson and Rowell will take votes from each other. Caroline Wilson 1. Nick Daicos\n\n2. Noah Anderson\n\nRoughie: Jack Gunston Daicos has been a proven vote-winner in his short but brilliant career. He stood out this season when Collingwood were flying and carried the Magpies during their slump. A proven champion will prevail in a tight field.\n\nMichael Gleeson 1. Nick Daicos\n\n2. Jordan Dawson\n\nRoughie: Jai Newcombe Daicos wasn\u2019t as good as last year, but last year was ridiculous. He can poll two thirds of the votes he did in 2024 and still win. Jon Pierik 1. Nick Daicos\n\n2. Jordan Dawson\n\nRoughie: Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera\n\nDaicos has had another superb season; his ball use is second to none. This year he shouldn\u2019t have to worry about being beaten in a record count. Dawson has been central to the Crows\u2019 rise, while Wanganeen-Milera is an All-Australian and should poll strongly, particularly late. Libby Birch 1. Jordan Dawson\n\n2. Bailey Smith\n\nRoughie: Ed Richards A huge year for Adelaide and Dawson, who was named in the All-Australian side and voted AFLPA captain of the year after leading the Crows to the minor premiership. He\u2019s relentless workhorse in the middle and a composed leader \u2013 what more could you ask from him? Smith has been a flashy, creative spark who\u2019s added plenty to Geelong. Meanwhile, Ed Richards enjoyed a genuine breakout year, stepping up in the midfield \u2013 especially when \u201cthe Bont\u201d was sidelined. Sam McClure\n\n1. Noah Anderson\n\n2. Nick Daicos\n\nRoughie: Zach Merrett Daicos is clearly the best player in the comp and probably should win it, but Brownlow counts can be strange affairs. Anderson catches the eye with his inside/outside dominance and is sure to poll well in any game Gold Coast won. Bob Murphy 1. Bailey Smith\n\n2. Nick Daicos\n\nRoughie: Ed Richards Dashing runs, new kit, long hair and a bright headband point to Smith. Oh, and the Cats win heaps of games.\n\nCalum Jaspan Loading 1. Nick Daicos\n\n2. Noah Anderson\n\nRoughie: Max Holmes It\u2019s a toss-up between Anderson and Daicos, but Daicos seems like a safe choice. The umpires love him and he\u2019s probably earned one. Peter Ryan\n\n1. Nick Daicos\n\n2. Jordan Dawson\n\nRoughie: Max Holmes Daicos didn\u2019t have as good a season as he did last year but he just polls votes and will take catching. Dawson is consistently the best player in the top-of-the-ladder team, while umpires spent last season understanding how good Max Holmes is, and will reward him with votes. Andrew Wu 1. Nick Daicos\n\n2. Matt Rowell\n\nRoughie: Jeremy Cameron Daicos is a proven vote-getter who will poll in plenty of games. Rowell finished seventh last year when he didn\u2019t have an outside game and Gold Coast were battlers. With 14 bags of four or more goals, Jeremy Cameron can sneak into the top 10 at ridiculous odds.\n\nJimmy Bartel 1. Nick Daicos\n\n2. Noah Anderson\n\nRoughie: Finn Callaghan The Giants won 16 games and Finn Callaghan was their most eye-catching performer. The line-breaker could cause a Brownlow boilover. Marc McGowan 1. Matt Rowell\n\n2. Nick Daicos\n\nRoughie: Marcus Bontempelli",

But I am sort of an open book at the moment to any sort of loan deals or whatever that might be,\u201d Pezet said during an appearance on NRL 360 during the week. \u201cObviously, the club has had a fair bit of experience in 2020 loaning out Harry there for a bit.\u201d NRL 360 host Braith Anasta, who is Pezet\u2019s manager, added: \u201cWe are not sure where this is going to land right now, it\u2019s sort of up in the air. But technically, he is a free agent. \u201cOf course [his preference] is to stay, but he is also a smart kid. Jahrome is the No.7 and he\u2019s just re-signed. We saw the other night how he plays as a No.7.\u201d\n\nIsaah Yeo insists shoulder injury won\u2019t cruel Kangaroo tour hopes Incumbent Kangaroos skipper Isaah Yeo is confident a partially dislocated shoulder that sidelined him towards the end of the regular season will not force him to miss the Ashes tour of England. Yeo was unable to finish Penrith\u2019s round-22 win against Gold Coast when his shoulder sub-luxed, or popped out, and he sat out three of their next four games leading into the finals. Penrith\u2019s inspirational skipper has since delivered two consecutive 80-minute performances, including last week\u2019s 24-8 win against the Warriors in the opening round of the play-offs.\n\nHe has produced 93 tackles in those two games, and carried the ball 256 metres, to allay any concerns about his fitness. \u201cI had to make a million tackles last week, so it\u2019s holding up all right ... everything\u2019s all systems go,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cIt\u2019s no dramas.\u201d Asked if he would need post-season surgery, which is often required after shoulder dislocations, Yeo replied: \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Isaah Yeo led the Kangaroos at last year\u2019s Pacific Championships. Credit: Getty Images That means the 30-year-old lock is likely to be available to represent Australia in their three Tests in the Old Dart in October and November. It will be the first Ashes series in 22 years.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly the plan, obviously,\u201d Yeo said when asked if he hoped to be available to tour. \u201cThat\u2019s all things considered, and you want to be a part of those ... you want to be a part of those big ones, particularly with sort of the history surrounded with it, and we just haven\u2019t been on a tour like that for so long. So, they\u2019re the ones you want to be a part of, and I\u2019ve certainly put my hand up for sure.\u201d Loading Yeo led Australia during a successful Pacific Championships campaign last year, skippered NSW in this year\u2019s State of Origin series, and has been co-captain in Penrith\u2019s four consecutive premiership wins. Yet he is not counting on retaining the Kangaroos\u2019 captaincy on the Ashes, saying that\u2019s a decision for new coach Kevin Walters.\n\n\u201cI just want to be on the squad first, and then I\u2019ll let Kevin figure all that out,\u201d he said. Yeo\u2019s immediate priority is Sunday\u2019s do-or-die final against Canterbury at Accor Stadium. He said there were plenty of similarities between the two sides, which is understandable given the Bulldogs signed coach Cameron Ciraldo from the Panthers in 2023, as well as a host of ex-Penrith players including Stephen Crichton, Matt Burton, Viliame Kikau and Jaeman Salmon. \u201cI just feel like we match up well with each other,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cI think we sort of both have similar styles. We want ball in play. \u201cWe back our defences both sides and ... it just makes for an exciting match-up and exactly what you want for this time of season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be hotly contested, it\u2019ll be a lot of ball and play I\u2019d imagine, and both teams backing their defence. So it\u2019ll be a wonderful challenge. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d Next season? Off-contract Kennedy is not looking beyond this week By Robert Dillon He is facing an uncertain future beyond the end of this season, but Cronulla fullback Will Kennedy says he\u2019s looking no further than the end of this week as he strives to enhance his bargaining position by helping the Sharks stay alive in 2025.\n\nKennedy, the 28-year-old who made his debut for Cronulla in 2019 and has played 132 games for the club, is off contract at the end of this campaign and has no desire to leave the Shire. Negotiations with the Sharks have been protracted, but Kennedy remains hopeful of a positive outcome, despite reports Cronulla\u2019s salary cap is stretched to the limit. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting, but I think everyone knows now that I want to stay around here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here since I was 18, so yeah, just whatever happens. I\u2019ll just focus on footy at the moment and I\u2019ll let all that take care of itself.\u201d Kennedy admits it is not ideal to be playing in the finals while not knowing what is in store for him next season, but he isn\u2019t \u201cgetting too stressed\u201d about the situation.\n\nWill Kennedy takes on the Roosters on Saturday night. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI think I\u2019m sort of used to it now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just sort of waiting, if that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got to do. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to focus on what\u2019s happening now, and that\u2019s probably just footy and enjoying the company of the boys while I\u2019m here \u2026 I\u2019m not too frustrated, but probably just for my family, just not knowing what\u2019s going to happen. It would be nice to know.\u201d Kennedy, whose management have kept his options open by contacting the organisers of the proposed R360 rugby union competition, was his usual reliable self in Saturday night\u2019s 20-10 victory over the Sydney Roosters in their elimination final. It was his 25th game of the season, and he has been a model of consistency, averaging 154 running metres a game, scoring eight tries and delivering 12 try assists.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just from learning and experience coming up through the ranks as well, having the boys around me for a while now,\u201d he said. \u201cI know my role, and I\u2019m just enjoying my footy and being happy with the boys. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d Saturday\u2019s win against the Roosters allowed Cronulla to progress to a sudden-death final in Canberra on Saturday against a Raiders team left shattered after Sunday\u2019s golden-point loss to Brisbane in the 94th minute. Kennedy knows from personal experience how such a defeat can negatively impact a team. After Cronulla lost in golden point against North Queensland in the opening round of the 2022 play-offs, they were then thrashed by South Sydney a week later. Cronulla have won eight of their past nine games, including Saturday night\u2019s elimination final win against the Roosters. Credit: Getty Images \u201cYeah, it was a tough one for them [Canberra], and even for the Broncos, playing that long,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a final here as well, going for that long as well, so it would be a bit draining.\n\n\u201cBut I think they\u2019ll still be up for it. Finals footy, it\u2019s a lot different to just a normal season, so I think we\u2019ve just got to go there and expect anything. It\u2019s do or die for both teams.\u201d Cronulla were underdogs against the Roosters last weekend and Kennedy indicated that suited them just fine. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing it our own way, and we\u2019re just going about our business,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the main thing we\u2019ve got to do, stick to what works for us and play for each other.\u201d Kikau plays through fracture pain, twice Dan Walsh\n\nCanterbury suspect star back-rower Viliame Kikau has already played more than one full match with a fractured eye socket while also sweating the fitness of halfback Toby Sexton for their sudden-death showdown with Penrith next weekend. The Bulldogs have already lost skipper Stephen Crichton (syndesmosis) and centre Enari Tuala to a leg fracture, though Bronson Xerri will return from a concussion lay-off against the Panthers. Viliame Kikau returns to Sydney on Saturday with a swollen right eye Credit: Channel Nine Canterbury officials believe Kikau first suffered a fractured eye socket against the Sharks \u2013 he sported a black eye all of last week \u2013 rather than in the early exchanges of last Friday\u2019s clash with Melbourne. The Fijian enforcer has played through the pain for the past two weeks and is yet to be ruled out of the Panthers clash. The fracture is said to be stable and a matter of pain management for Kikau.\n\nSexton, meanwhile, is set for further scans on Monday in the hope of ruling out a sternum fracture. The Catalans-bound halfback suffered a knock to his chest against the Storm. His sternum issue adds another headache to Cameron Ciraldo\u2019s playmaking conundrum. Sexton had performed strongly following the injury to Crichton, which opened the door for him to get onto the field. Ciraldo can either keep Matt Burton and Lachlan Galvin in the halves, or shift Burton to centre for a Sexton-Galvin combination. Toby Sexton has his sternum injury examined against Melbourne. Credit: Getty Images Winger Marcelo Montoya (ankle) is a chance to return against the Panthers, a welcome result given the Bulldogs have few options in their backline beyond reserve winger Blake Wilson. Should Sexton be ruled out, out-of-favour hooker Reed Mahoney would come into contention for a bench recall. Penrith have reported a clean bill of health out of their win over the Warriors, with Nathan Cleary handing goalkicking duties to Dylan Edwards due to a cork he picked up in the second half.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size This week\u2019s books range from fiction set in Japan\u2019s Meiji era and some rock\u2019n\u2019roll fiction to Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s revealing memoir and the secrets of birdsong. FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK I Am a Cat\n\nNatsume S\u014dseki\n\nVintage Classics, $32.99 Before cats became masters of the meme-verse, before the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, and before even its source material, T.S. Eliot\u2019s Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats (1939), there was Natsume S\u014dseki\u2019s I Am a Cat (1905-6). The satirical classic gives a cat\u2019s eye view of Japanese literati during the late Meiji period. It\u2019s told by an anonymous moggie who arrives in the household of a pseudo-intellectual, Sneaze, and makes catty observations about the professors and scholars and poets who congregate there. The Meiji era coined the Japanese word tsundoku \u2013 a term for buying books and allowing them to pile up unread \u2013 which should give you some idea of how status-obsessed these bookish humans are. Our cat narrator unsheathes its claws and takes wry swipes at every foible and flaw \u2013 from the physical loathing the humans seem to display for themselves and each other, to tensions between Western and Japanese philosophical and cultural traditions. The narrator itself isn\u2019t beyond reproach \u2013 the cat assumes it has won celebrity status after randomly photobombing a postcard \u2013 though that only adds to the charm of this cynical, surprisingly prescient satire of human failings. Fireweather\n\nMiranda Darling\n\nScribe, $29.99\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA sequel to Thunderhead (2024), Miranda Darling\u2019s Fireweather delves into the mind of a woman on the verge of \u2013 for want of a better word \u2013 madness. Or is it the world that\u2019s gone mad? In the previous book, we got a day in the life of Winona Dalloway, confined by suburban domesticity and motherhood. It fused black comedy with interior mental landscape and found itself in conversation with Virginia Woolf, among other feminist forebears. In Fireweather, we get drawn into Winona\u2019s mind as her marriage looks like ending in divorce and her children are absent. The world is on fire, literally, with black ash falling from the sky. Internally, Winona splits into multiple voices \u2013 dissociating into archetypes such as The Archer, The Nanny and The Poet \u2013 as she falls down a mental health rabbit-hole. She thinks she\u2019s sane. Increasingly, mental health professionals disagree. Darling writes feminist fiction infused with wit, intertextuality and a poetic command of language, creating a compelling, intricate internal voice that stands, too, as a critique of institutional misogyny in psychiatry. Eleanor Jones Is Playing with Fire\n\nAmy Doak\n\nPenguin, $19.99 The third in Amy Doak\u2019s award-winning Eleanor Jones series of YA mysteries (after Eleanor Jones Is Not a Murderer and Eleanor Jones Can Keep a Secret), immediately demonstrates its appeal, even to the uninitiated. Doak has created a wry and relatable adolescent narrator, at home in a gossipy world of teen crushes and high-school drama yet thrust into solving crimes. At the novel\u2019s opening, she still hasn\u2019t kissed love interest Troy, and no less importantly, there\u2019s an arsonist on the loose in Cooinda, the rural town Eleanor moved to with her mother Min in the first book. Is a spate of car thefts potentially linked to the fires? Eleanor\u2019s warned off investigating by a local cop, but trouble has a way of seeking her out and, in any event, someone must get to the bottom of the mystery before the whole of Cooinda goes up in smoke. Eleanor\u2019s an entertaining teen narrator, her circle of friends is realistically drawn, and the mix of schoolyard romance and puzzle-like detective fiction should, I imagine, make this an addictive series for an early high school audience. Hot Wax\n\nM.L. Rio\n\nWildfire, $32.99\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve lost count of how many rock\u2019n\u2019roll novels I\u2019ve read over the years, but almost without exception the genre is expected to tick two boxes. You\u2019ve got to write a love letter to the power of music, on the one hand, and a sharp indictment of the dark side of the industry, on the other. M.L. Rio\u2019s Hot Wax cleaves to the mould, though the narrative has an unexpected twist, and enough depth of character to keep it from feeling completely formulaic. The split narrative follows Suzanne from 10 years old. She\u2019s drawn to her dad\u2019s world of fast cars and electric guitars and accompanies a rock band on a concert tour, where she witnesses fame and infamy intertwining. Years later, Suzanne settles down with a dull husband, Rob, but when her father suddenly dies, she abandons suburbia for the road, determined to find out what happened. Rob isn\u2019t happy about it, planning to track Suzanne down to confront her. M.L. Rio is the author of the BookTok sensation If We Were Villains: this latest should appeal to her fans, even if it seems undistinguished to connoisseurs of rock music fiction. Slashed Beauties\n\nA. Rushby\n\nHQ, $32.99 Wax dummies made from 18th-century sex workers \u2013 so-called Anatomical Venuses \u2013 are imbued with fatal, supernatural powers of vengeance. They come to life and murder any man who dares a lustful glance. (Take that, male gaze!) Such is the conceit of A. Rushby\u2019s Slashed Beauties. In the modern day, antiques dealer Alys is intimately connected to the wax figures. Entrusted with transporting one of them safely, she seeks to prevent uncontrolled magical mayhem from being unleashed. Back in 18th-century London, we follow the fortunes of the three women whose bodies were models for the wax figures. All are involved in the sex industry. Young ingenue Eleanor falls in with Elizabeth, a kept woman who opens a high-class brothel. Entering a world of luxury and corruption alongside fellow newcomer Emily, Eleanor finds herself well-compensated, financially free, but on a dark path she cannot control. Some elements of the world-building are under-realised and the prose is largely pedestrian. If you read only for plot, however, this blend of sisterhood novel and feminist revenge fantasy might just grab you. NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK Love\u2019s Labour\n\nStephen Grosz\n\nChatto & Windus, $36.99\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I read psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz\u2019s previous book The Examined Life, I found myself wishing I could bring him my troubles. He is the kind of listener we all want. Attentive, rigorous, non-judgmental. This is not to suggest he presents himself as someone who can \u201cfix\u201d his patients\u2019 problems. Analysis, he stresses in his latest collection of case studies, Love\u2019s Labour, is a collaboration. If love\u2019s labour is \u201cthe work we must do to see clearly ourselves and our loved ones\u201d, much of that labour is a joint effort carried out in the analyst\u2019s consulting room. Take the story of Matt. His closest relationships don\u2019t feel real because he has been conditioned to repress anger and hate. When he sends Grosz a furious email saying that he doesn\u2019t like him, Grosz knows progress has been made. Then there\u2019s Ravi, who\u2019s convinced his wife is having an affair. He breaks off the analysis, allowing this delusion to ultimately ruin his love for her because he can\u2019t let go the \u201cecstasy of sanctimony\u201d. Love\u2019s labour, Grosz reminds us in this moving and insightful work, is never done. All the Way to the River\n\nElizabeth Gilbert\n\nBloomsbury, $34.99 On the surface, everything looked great. Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s novel The Signature of All Things had shown those who dismissed her as a chick-lit lightweight after the phenomenal success of Eat, Pray, Love that she was a serious, literary writer. But beneath the surface, chaos brewed. Although happily married, Gilbert was in love with her closest friend, Rayya Elias, but couldn\u2019t admit to it. Only when Elias was diagnosed with terminal cancer did their bottled up love explode. \u201cWe were ecstatic, phosphorescent, dangerous, brilliant and full of wild courage,\u201d she writes. Until, that is, this wild ride turned into a nightmare as Elias succumbed to her cocaine addiction and Gilbert fuelled it with her addiction to love and sex. Gilbert doesn\u2019t spare herself or Elias while laying bare how abject and wretched they became. But, as a recovering addict, she believes that the truth is what sets you free. The high voltage intensity of this memoir, with its operatic declarations, is not for everyone. Apron-Sorrow/ Sovereign-Tea\n\nNatalie Harkin\n\nWakefield Press, $49.95 \u201cSovereign-Tea.\u201d There is so much packed into this poignant play on words. It speaks of the constraints on Aboriginal women in domestic servitude and of their quiet strength. Their job was, as Natalie Harkin so eloquently puts it, to \u201cclean up the colonial mess\u201d. To keep the white settlers\u2019 homes tidy, to look after their children. Even though they themselves might have been taken from their parents or had their children taken from them. The documents Harkin has retrieved from the archives lay bare the chilling and patronising mentality of the colonial bureaucratic mind. A State Lady\u2019s report on one Aboriginal woman in domestic service reads: \u201cYou need firm handling. You must realise that you cannot have your own way always in this world\u201d. Set against this exercise of state power are the women\u2019s stories and the memories of their descendants. Stories imbued with sadness but also with resourcefulness and dignity. Stories of artistic and musical talent, of determination and spirit. Here, their labour is made visible, their voices heard.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "It is Frank\u2019s most harrowing experiences that she demands her editor include. But Bow Tie wants to appeal to young readers. He wants her innocence retained. Loading Whose truth gets told is a key theme in the play, but it\u2019s presented as a straw-man argument between the well-realised Frank and a caricatured editor. Playwright Ron Elisha was inspired to write this polemical piece after reading an essay by American Dara Horn that questioned why the Diary of Anne Frank, with its hopeful final line, has been so successful. Horn argued that the diary lets readers off the hook, offering facile forgiveness while bypassing darker complexities. The Frank presented on stage is far from the poster girl for forgiveness. She\u2019s filled with rage and hate at what she\u2019s experienced.\n\nThis is a demanding show in which the versatile Fishman plays all the roles, including Bow Tie and the camp guard. She is a powerful and nuanced Frank, as she evolves from innocent teenager to a woman burning with fury and fighting to tell her unvarnished tale. Amanda Brooke Lerner\u2019s direction makes shifts of time and place clear, and the most confronting scenes are sensitively handled. Jacob Battista\u2019s static set evokes the three locations with a sparse wooden bed conjuring the camp. At one side is the Amsterdam attic, on the other the editor\u2019s book-lined office and wooden desk. The location and tone shifts are aided by Finnegan Comte-Harvey\u2019s effective lighting. This is a bleak, thoughtful piece that comes against a backdrop of rising conflict, not only in the Middle East. It offers no easy solutions or plea for peace. Yet if we shred the idea of a humanity capable of good, where does that leave us? In a world unable to escape our escalating savagery.\n\nTHEATRE\n\nTRENT DALTON\u2019S LOVE STORIES\n\nRiverside Theatres, September 12\n\nUntil September 20\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u00bd If you chanced to walk by a Brisbane street corner in 2021, you may have come across Trent Dalton, Walkley-winning journalist and our nation\u2019s current literary golden boy. He\u2019s sitting behind a sky-blue 1960s Olivetti typewriter with a sign reading \u201csentimental writer collecting love stories\u201d. With (at least according to the dramatic interpretation) crinkly eyes and a boyish smile, he invites you and every other regular bloke and missus passing by to tell him their own personal love story. Those true-blue anecdotes became Love Stories, the book, which was adapted by Tim Garry into a cine-theatrical and wildly popular Brisbane Festival and QPAC show. It is playing in Parramatta this month on its five-city tour, directed by Sam Strong. Live video is a necessary distraction and stimulation. Credit:\n\nIt was of course Boy Swallows Universe that catapulted Dalton to literary stardom. Writing in relentless aphorism, with plots that heave with romanticism and old-school Aussie nostalgia, reading Dalton feels like a bad-taste populist parody, as unpleasant as popping candy. That\u2019s just one opinion, though, and seemingly a minority one. Along with the vulture reviewers, Love Stories\u2019 PR team invited a flock of book influencers to opening night, with a shameless plug of Swallows in the play itself. Loading Jason Klarwein is our dramatised Dalton, sitting at that street corner with his Olivetti, ear cocked towards the plangent sound of the common man\u2019s heartstrings. The play is structured as a relentless whirlwind of bite-size profundities and platitudes, with dozens of characters relaying their deepest truths, then disappearing into the skin of another through their respective actor. All stories get a screen subtitle in large, typewriter font. Live video that captures both on-stage actors and sometimes the audience is a necessary distraction and stimulation. The play would feel very flat without this technical virtuosity, which sometimes deploys overlays, delays and other special effects, and makes much use of the dramatic close-up. There is also some contemporary dance.\n\nLove Stories on stage reproduces the numbing sensation of watching a TikTok feed with the algorithm set to \u201cBig Feelings\u201d. There are stories of lovers who die in car crashes, and lovers who propose in flash mobs; love as a perfect sub/dom pairing, and love as a Rwandan genocide orphan found under a tree. There\u2019s love as childhood friendship, and love as finding \u201cthree good things\u201d to survive each day. That last story, inhabited by Hsin-Ju Ely, was almost moving. And it\u2019s true the cast of 10 makes the most of the material, with standouts in Rashidi Edward, Valerie Bader and Kirk Page. The show is not without self-awareness. The narrative through-line is character-Dalton\u2019s own love story \u2013 which is far past the honeymoon stage. With his wife (Anna McGahan) understandably frustrated at the sacrifices she\u2019s made so her husband can bum around Brisbane\u2019s CBD and listen attentively to everyone but her, she\u2019s put herself in therapy. This central story provides welcome continuity and some sharp rebuttals to the schmaltz. It all wraps up nicely by the end of course, with a wedding ring remade. What\u2019s not to love? See previous.\n\nTHEATRE\n\nTRUE WEST\n\nEnsemble Theatre, September 12\n\nUntil October 11\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Simon Maiden\u2019s Lee creates a tension thick with latent violence, a black hole of negative energy. His blank eyes stare with hate and resentment. \u201cYou go ahead, like I wasn\u2019t even here,\u201d he tells his brother Austin (Darcy Kent), who\u2019s trying to write a screenplay, but Austin may as well try to imagine a world without sibling rivalry. In Sam Shepard\u2019s supreme 1980 play True West, Lee, the elder brother, is the daredevil, wastrel and lost soul capable of physical violence and minor criminality. He lobs in on the college-educated, mild-mannered Austin, who\u2019s house-minding \u2013 plant-minding, primarily \u2013 for their mother while she\u2019s in Alaska. Austin\u2019s using her southern California bungalow as a writer\u2019s retreat to nail down a love story that already has interest from a producer, Saul (James Lugton). James Lugton, Simon Maiden and Darcy Kent in True West. Credit: Prudence Upton But hard-drinking Lee has a story of his own, and he gazumps Austin by selling Saul on the idea of a modern-day western that\u2019s one big chase sequence \u2013 a metaphor (although he doesn\u2019t know it) for the lifelong game of chase the brothers have been playing.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine three consecutive nights of high-calibre theatre more disparate than the oneiric Orlando (Belvoir St), the bluegrass poignancy of Bright Star (Hayes Theatre) and then True West. If you only see one, make it this. It\u2019s directed by Iain Sinclair, who did the Ensemble\u2019s memorable The Caretaker three years ago, and there are overlaps between Pinter and Shepard. They both like characters who struggle to communicate, and whose frustration breeds aggression. Shepard consummately structures his play so that when Austin joins Lee on his drinking binge (after Saul favours Lee\u2019s movie idea), the gulf between their characters shrinks until the similarities seem to outweigh the differences. But that only masks underlying resentments. Maiden and Kent are riveting, walking the seesaw of power imbalance between them. There\u2019s a moment late on when Kent is on his knees, staring up at Maiden, his performance so potent you can see in his eyes the ghost of the hero-worship he once had for his brother. Lugton\u2019s Saul is the sunbeam of humour blazing through the storm clouds in a wide-collared paisley shirt and perfectly pressed cream trousers (courtesy of designer Simone Romaniuk). Lugton adds matching bonhomie and bravado \u2013 at least in Saul\u2019s dealings with Austin. Lee can\u2019t so easily be tamed by smiling promises. Alas for the brilliant Maiden, a medical emergency forced him from the stage near the end, halting the show for 20 minutes, after which Sinclair read Lee (in costume), and commendably saw the fraternal war to its inevitable conclusion.\n\nThis includes the unexpected return of the boys\u2019 mother, played by Vanessa Downing, who probably didn\u2019t have to work too hard to be in a state of shock after what had happened to Maiden, and who completed a stellar cast fulfilling Shepard\u2019s manic vision: a snapshot of an America that can tear itself apart. MUSIC\n\nA Musical Awakening\n\nAustralian Chamber Orchestra, September 17\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd The program opened and closed with musical meditations on hymn-like melodies that evoked a search for serenity and transcendence that became the concert\u2019s dominant theme. The first piece, Illuminations, grew out of a soundscape by Erkki Veltheim, which could be heard in the foyers and hall as listeners arrived. Birdsong, wispy rustling and cavernous wind sounds created the ambience of daybreak and moved seamlessly into a performance by recorder player Genevieve Lacey of Hildegard von Bingen\u2019s 12th-century chant Ave, Generosa. Lacey was quietly accompanied by ACO members playing sustained notes, scurrying figures and fragments of the hymn, which lingered like shapes imprinted on the retina after the object has gone.\n\nGenevieve Lacey and theorbo player Simon Martyn-Ellis. Credit: Charlie Kinross On the Nature of Daylight by Max Richter continued without a break with theorbo player Simon Martyn-Ellis providing delicate decoration and incisive bass notes to a chorale-like harmonic progression that began on cellos and swelled to the entire string orchestra. Wiima by Finnish composer Jaakko Kuusisto (whose Cello Concerto the concert\u2019s director Timo-Veikko Valve played to such striking effect earlier this year) broke abruptly from the meditative mood with an initial jabbing, thick chord. This turbulent work juxtaposed surging wind-like textures with penetrating solos and rhapsodically expressive recitatives, closing with an angular rhythmic passage that culminated in a frantic expressive moment. David Lang\u2019s flute and echo (receiving a world premiere) was, on the surface, exactly what the label said. Lacey played a hauntingly resonant arabesque on one of the lower pitched recorders, which was echoed with some details trimmed by lead violinist Helena Rathbone and then further abridged by the rest of the orchestra. Lacey retained rounded warmth to the sound as she played progressively higher instruments and the \u201cechoes\u201d fragmented further. When, at the end, she returned to the opening arabesque the surrounding echoes drifted off with their own textures as though cut free.\n\nAfter interval Melody Eotvos\u2019s Meraki (a Greek word meaning, in her words, when you \u201cput something of yourself\u201d into what you are doing), built up a dark bed of sound from low strings. The piece also had hymn-like moments mixed with passages of tussling rhythmic vigour. In Imaginary Cities: A Baroque Fantasy , Veltheim created another soundscape against which Lacey led the orchestra in music from the Venetian Baroque by Monteverdi, Vivaldi and Strozzi. It provided an opportunity to hear Lacey chirp with agile virtuosity on a high-pitched recorder in Vivaldi\u2019s Recorder Concerto in C major. The closing work, Beethoven\u2019s Heiliger Dankgesang (Holy Song of Thanksgiving) from the String Quartet in A minor, Opus 132, took on a sad and solemn significance as a tribute to the passing last Saturday of John Painter. Beginning his career in the SSO under Eugene Goossens, Painter is fondly remembered and revered by generations of Australian musicians, as cellist, teacher, Director of the NSW State Conservatorium (as it was then called) and the Canberra School of Music and as founder of the ACO fifty years ago.\n\nMUSICAL THEATRE\n\nBRIGHT STAR\n\nHayes Theatre, September 11\n\nUntil October 5\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Don\u2019t necessarily judge a musical by its soundtrack. The original Broadway cast recording of Bright Star suggested I was in for a long night. The music and lyrics, by Steve Martin and Edie Brickell, are in a bluegrass/country vein, evoking the setting in North Carolina\u2019s Blue Ridge Mountains. The songs sounded samey, the singing ordinary, and perhaps there was a good reason why nobody had penned a bluegrass musical before. But that didn\u2019t allow for Steve Martin\u2019s book, with its sharply drawn characters, wit and poignancy \u2013 as well as unabashed melodrama \u2013 melodrama having kept country ballads simmering since folks first donned cowboy boots. Bright Star is Sport for Jove\u2019s first musical. Credit: Robert Catto It also didn\u2019t allow for the Broadway album\u2019s singing being completely outgunned in a production devised, improbably, by leading Shakespeare company, Sport for Jove. Why, I\u2019d wondered, would Sport for Jove lower the bar to hick musical theatre? Now I understand.\n\nAlthough this is the company\u2019s first musical, music has long been key to its Shakespeare productions, and Bright Star burnishes rather than clouds its reputation. Directors Miranda Middleton and Damien Ryan and musical director Alec Steedman have assembled a 16-person ensemble, almost all of whom act, sing, dance and play. It seemed only three band members didn\u2019t have a character to play, and only one cast member didn\u2019t play an instrument. That was Hannah McInerney in the pivotal role of Alice Murphy. She has two especially potent songs, Please Don\u2019t Take Him and At Long Last, and they would test the ability of any female singer not to become shrill while squeezing out the show\u2019s emotional marrow. McInerney was superlative \u2013 and also acted her socks off as a literary magazine editor whose newborn babe was ripped from her arms 23 years before. The show zigzags between 1946 and 1923 with an abruptness that initially teases, but we get our heads around it, and learn to trust Martin\u2019s storytelling and invest in his detailed characters. In an ensemble of co-leads, the expert actors included Cameron Bajraktarevic-Hayward, Kaya Byrne, Jack Green, Sean van Doornum, Katrina Retallick and Rupert Reid. Special mentions must go to Deirdre Khoo, who maximises the minor role of Lucy most entertainingly, and Genevieve Goldman (Margo), who has an ideal voice for the material, and who, upon learning that her love interest, Billy, is being published by Alice\u2019s magazine, performs a little dance of exquisite ecstasy. The lively choreography by Shannon Burns dovetails with the whip-crack directing, including such joy as a door held up to be knocked on, which, upon being opened, magically becomes a dining table. Designer Isabel Hudson cunningly implied the prevailing rusticity while accommodating 16 performers on the tight stage.\n\nYes, the melodrama undid certain moments, and the redemptive storyline was predictable, yet all was animated by the music\u2019s high energy under Steedman\u2019s direction and Victoria Falconer\u2019s onstage supervision. MUSICAL THEATRE\n\nHERE YOU COME AGAIN\n\nTheatre Royal, September 13\n\nUntil October 18\n\nReviewed by JOYCE MORGAN\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 The towering blonde wigs, the eyelashes, the rhinestones. And that\u2019s just the drag queens in the front stalls. This fanfest was always going to draw Dolly Parton\u2019s most flamboyant admirers.\n\nIt\u2019s more tribute show than fully fledged musical, so don\u2019t look for insights into Dolly or even much about the life of the fiercely talented singer/songwriter, Tennessee-born musician. Tricia Paoluccio delivers an impeccable, sparkly Dolly. Credit: Cameron Grant Fortunately, the star of this show delivers an impeccable, sparkly Dolly. Tricia Paoluccio captures Dolly\u2019s clear, bright voice, southern drawl and warm-hearted spirit. Whether acting lines or singing from the extensive Parton songbook, Paoluccio channels her idol. Threaded through this jukebox musical is a slender story about Dolly-tragic Kevin. Set amid the COVID pandemic, the 40-year-old has moved into his parents\u2019 attic. Kevin\u2019s career is on the skids, and his boyfriend has dumped him. Surrounded by stockpiled toilet rolls (remember that pandemic phenomenon?), Kevin is hoofing into the booze and Cheezels.\n\n\u201cWhat would Dolly do?\u201d he wonders. And, hey presto, she materialises \u2013 a vision in a pink frock and rhinestones. This is Dolly as fairy godmother. She\u2019s come to set Kevin\u2019s world to rights, help him restore his confidence and impart some homespun wisdom. What follows is a string of Parton numbers, her big hits \u2013 Here You Come Again, Jolene, Islands in the Stream, I Will Always Love You \u2013 and some lesser-known. These were well delivered, if not well integrated into the story. Taking a musical icon and spinning a tale around that figure can work brilliantly, as Titanique showed with its conceit that Celine Dion was on the doomed ship. But to succeed, the writing needs to be sharp and the story fleshed out. Here, the sections between the music sagged, especially in the first half as Kevin wallowed endlessly in his misery. As Kevin whined and Dolly retorted with more homespun wisdom than a crate of Hallmark greetings cards, by interval the repetition was deflating.",

Source: Getty / Lisa Lake In Greenfield's statement, he said it was \"profoundly disappointing to come to the conclusion that that independence, the very basis of our sale to Unilever, is gone\".\n\n\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Unilever and its Magnum Ice Cream Co said that it \"disagrees with Greenfield's perspective and has sought to engage both co-founders in a constructive conversation on how to strengthen Ben & Jerry's powerful values-based position in the world\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBen and Jerry's has long combined selling ice cream and activism, launching one ice cream in 2019 to build awareness about racial justice, and renaming a flavour in 2009 in support of gay marriage.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the relationship between Unilever and Ben and Jerry's has eroded since 2021, when the ice cream maker said it would stop sales in the Israeli-occupied West Bank as it would run counter to their values \u2014 a move that led some investors to divest from the London-based parent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, Greenfield and Cohen wrote in the New York Times that they supported the move.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the company failed to block Unilever from selling the ice cream in West Bank settlements after Unilever ultimately sold the business in Israel to a local licensee, a move the brand sued over, but later settled.\n\n\n\nJerry Greenfield (left) co-founded Ben and Jerry's alongside friend Ben Cohen in 1978. The company was sold to British multinational Unilever in 2000. Source: AAP / AP / Toby Talbot The brand has sued Unilever a second time over alleged efforts to muzzle it and dismantle the social mission board.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March, the company said in a court filing that Unilever had unlawfully removed CEO Dave Stever due to his support of the brand's progressive social activism.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreenfield's departure comes as the Ben and Jerry's founders have been calling for its own spin-off, ahead of a planned listing of Magnum Ice Cream in November.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Cohen held a protest in London as the new Magnum Ice Cream Company presented its growth plans, demanding Unilever \"free Ben and Jerry's\" to protect its social values.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat was rebuffed by new Magnum CEO Peter ter Kulve.\n\n\n\n",

He will likely need to dip under the 20-second barrier \u2014 something no Australian has done before \u2014 if he's to advance to Friday's final.\n\n\n\n\n\nShould he make it all the way, you're in for a late night: that will take place at 11.06pm AEST on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe favourite is Lyles from the United States, and for good reason: he's won all three of the last world championship titles in the event.\n\n\n\nGout has said after Tokyo, he'll be taking a short break from competition to return to Australia for his final exams at school.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the demands of his athletics training, the sprinter is known as a highly accomplished student with high grades and an interest in studying psychology.\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery session from the nine-day event will be broadcast live and free across SBS VICELAND, including the World Athletics Championships 2025 Hub via SBS On Demand, which will also feature full replays, mini recaps and Aussie Focus clips for every session.\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning sessions will run from 8am to 1.30pm AEST on September 13\u201315 and 20\u201321, while evening sessions will be from 8pm to 11.30pm AEST each night of the championships.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's the full schedule for SBS's broadcast of the World Athletics Championships.\n\n\n\n",

The environment is great, everyone\u2019s friendly, and the opportunity here is great - like working-wise, or raising a family, it\u2019s a very good place.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso at the citizenship ceremony is 29-year-old Chin Mun Lim, who was born in Malaysia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I find (Australia) is very laid back, relaxing country when I first came to study. I really enjoy the coffee, fantastic coffee compared to Malaysia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople from more than 140 nations attended ceremonies held over 24 hours for Australian Citizenship Day.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe idea was implemented in 2001, the year of the Centenary of Federation, following a recommendation for a special day to celebrate Australian citizenship.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 17th was chosen as the day as it recognises the legislation that gave rise to the idea of Australian citizenship under the then-named Nationality and Citizenship Act of 1948.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1973 on September 17th, it was renamed the Australian Citizenship Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first year of the Act, nearly 2,500 become citizens (2,493 people) from just over 35 different nationalities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top five nationalities at the time were: Italian, Polish, Greek, German and Yugoslav.\n\n\n\nSince then more than 6.2 million people have become Australian citizens by conferral - including 165,000 people in the 12 months to June representing over 190 different nationalities.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe top five countries of birth these days are New Zealand, India, the UK, Philippines and Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish subjects resident in Australia for the five years prior to 26 January 1949 were automatically made Australian citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were also granted Australian citizenship at that time, but the citizenship law excluded them from voting, until 1962.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe citizenship law previously excluded migrants from non-European countries due to the White Australia Policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1957, the law was amended to include non-European migrants, but only if they had been an Australian resident for 15 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince it was passed, the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948 has been amended more than 30 times, reflecting changing attitudes towards immigration.\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Zealander Allan Lee is among another 50 new Australians who attended a ceremony in the City of Coffs Harbour in New South Wales.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs an SBS News journalist he has covered the Citizenship Day for the past few years, but Mr Lee says he still found this ceremony to be emotionally moving.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was handled beautifully in Coffs Harbour, the mayor was there, and our local MP. The mayor handled it. It was very friendly, but we did all the formalities properly. We were made to feel very welcome. We were made to feel it's a very special day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo mark the special day, Mr Lee wore a necklace with a precious stone revered by M\u0101ori and New Zealanders called pounamu, or greenstone.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says he regards the honour of citizenship with great respect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Here is a bunch of people who, we are all signing up to become Australian citizens. And yes, that brings enormous benefits, because we are Australian citizens. But it also brings responsibilities to the nation, to our neighbours, to our environment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Lee says he already has his first task lined up now that he is an Australian citizen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The first thing I'm going to do is register to vote. I've been here for 11 years and not been able to take part in the democratic process, and I shall be registering to vote in the next day or so.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe citizenship ceremonies come amid mass protests attended by neo-Nazis where rally speakers and organisers have used language promoting hate to single out and target certain groups, while also spreading misinformation about migration levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the protests, Liberal senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price's remarks on Indian migrants resulted in her being demoted in the party, a week after she claimed Labor was bringing Indian migrants into Australia to boost its electoral chances.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe later distanced herself from the comments, but insisted she would continue to be vocal about what she called the mass migration problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week, Australia's Special Envoy to Combat Islamophobia, Aftab Malik, also delivered a long-awaited report that found Islamophobia is a persistent problem in Australia that has never been fully addressed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to SBS Arabic at an event held by the Australian Syrian Business Network, Immigration and Citizenship Minister Tony Burke says multiculturalism is something that should be celebrated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And I'll have one message for every new citizen, and that's to say to them welcome home, we are grateful that they chose Australia and welcome home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernor-General Sam Mostyn told SBS Chinese that she also has a message for Australia's newest citizens.\n\n\n\n",

The communique we signed establishes the core principles of the Treaty that has been processed below the cabinet level. So both cabinets got to run the process to run, and then after cabinet gives its blessing, it goes to Parliament for that treaty to be ratified. These important institutional processes are running, so we cannot, we're not we're not running a military dictatorship here. It's a democracy. You gotta allow the process, due process, to complete this first.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe setback marks the second time in as many weeks that Mr Albanese has failed to finalise a deal with Pacific neighbours, after a security pact with Vanuatu the week before also wasn't signed.\n\n\n\n\n\nConcerns arose over the Vanuatu agreement's potential impacts on their ability to receive foreign funding from infrastructure, with some sources pointing to pressure from China.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pukpuk Treaty with PNG, named after the pidgin word for Crocodile, would elevate the relationship between Papua New Guinea and Australia to an alliance, making it the first new alliance forged by Australia in over 70 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked if Chinese influence may be affecting the outcome of this deal, Mr Marape said China respects Papua New Guinea's choice of Australia as its key security partner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"China has been an enduring friend of PNG. For the last 50 years, we've maintained One China policy, but China also knows clearly that in as far as security, we have our security partners of choice, and so this has in no way, shape or form, Chinese have any hand in saying, don't do this et cetera.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the communique, the pact lays out provisions for the expansion and modernisation of the defence relationship, including by establishing a pathway for Papua New Guinea citizens to enter the Australian Defence Force.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt also requires both parties to ensure that any activities, agreements or arrangements with other parties don't compromise the implementation of the treaty.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the apparent concerns within Mr Marape's coalition over the deal's impact on PNG's sovereignty, both Mr Albanese and Mr Marape maintain they expect the deal to be ratified very soon.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrushing aside questions over whether the delay is an embarrassment, Mr Albanese says he is not interested in forcing a deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a request from PNG to Australia, to which Australia agreed. Processes, democracies aren't the same as authoritarian regimes. They go through processes. We respect them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Port Moresby for the celebrations of 50 years since PNG gained independence from Australia, Mr Albanese says the security deal is a fitting way to mark the occasion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While Papua New Guinea's independence was formalised by an act of the Australian Parliament. It was made possible, not by that, it was made possible by the acts of courage, imagination and leadership from the people of Papua New Guinea, because independence was never Australia's gift to give. It was Papua New Guinea's right to assert and your opportunity to seize. It was your people's dream, and together, you worked to make it real and have worked to build this nation in the last 50 years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Mr Albanese was taking part in independence commemorations, China and PNG signed a memorandum of understanding over environmental cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the Albanese Labor government, securing deals in the Pacific has been a central tenet of Australia's foreign policy, including a landmark climate pact with Tuvalu and a controversial deportation deal with Nauru.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PM is also pursuing a security treaty with Fiji, one of only three Pacific nations with a defence force, along with PNG and Tonga.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens leader Larissa Waters said earlier in the week that Australia's Pacific neighbours want the government to stop opening gas and coal projects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've just seen the prime minister on a global tour with quite a series of failures along the way. Many of our Pacific neighbours don't really like being told what to do by Australia, being tied to the hip with Donald Trump's America, and they're refusing to sign up to these pacts. But what they are calling for Australia to do is get out of AUKUS and stop opening new coal and gas.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Mr Albanese faces scrutiny over delays, Prime Minister Marape said this visit from Australian leadership meant much more than signing a deal.\n\n\n\n",

Security comes number one. As your prime minister, I made a conscious choice. A choice knowing our history, knowing our culture, knowing our ethical value and moral value systems, knowing our democratic ideals. We've made a conscious choice that Australia remains our security partner of choice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's been a major setback in plans for the proposed stadium that would be home to Tasmania's AFL team, the Devils.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tasmanian Planning Commission has recommended against building the Macquarie Point stadium, concluding it is \"too big for the site and the benefits it will bring are significantly outweighed by the disbenefits it creates\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, it will be MPs in state parliament who will decide the future of the project, as it will need approval from both houses of parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nPremier Jeremy Rockliff says the commission's report underestimates the social and economic benefits, and insists the project should go ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Rockliff: \"Well I disagree.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nReporter: \"You disagree with the report?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJeremy Rockliff: \"This is intergeneration infrastructure. This is not just for the next three to five years. This is for the next 30, 40, 50 years. This is intergenerational infrastructure that will build aspiration amongst our young people, give opportunity and hope to young people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nSussan Ley has used her first major economic speech as Opposition Leader to warn that Australians are too dependent on the welfare system.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeking to reclaim her party's conservative economic credentials after a landslide loss at the last election, she told an audience of economists at the think tank CEDA [[see-dah]] that the government cannot shield everyone from all cost of living pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe did not outline any major policy announcements, but says the right balance needs to be restored between what citizens provide for themselves \u2013 and what taxpayers provide through a safety net.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are a compassionate nation, and we will always support those who fall on hard times. But if we want to keep the safety net strong, we have to ensure it is financially sustainable and targetted to genuine need. Unfortunately in the past few years, the pendulum has swung too far towards dependency. It has become almost taboo in politics to suggest that not everyone is entitled to a government benefit.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands are celebrating becoming new Australians today, as Australian Citizenship Day is observed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitizenship ceremonies will be held across the country, with people from more than 140 nations becoming citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last 12 months to June, Australia conferred over 165,000 citizens*. The top five countries of birth are New Zealand, India, the UK, Philippines and Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Tony Burke, has welcomed all those who have chosen to call Australia home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's been some terrible messages that some people have been receiving about immigration. I'll be presiding at a massive citizenship ceremony and I'll have one message for every new citizen, and that's to say to them: Welcome home. We are grateful that they chose Australia, and welcome home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport now and in athletics, no Australian will line up in the men's 800-metre semifinals at the World Athletics Championships, after Peter Bol finished fourth in his heat by 0.02 of a second.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 31-year-old held towards the front for most of the race but started to fade down the home stretch \u2013 and was passed in the last few strides to the line.\n\n\n\n\n\nBol says he didn't show enough patience on the track.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The issue is the patience goes once you get faster, you get a little bit hungrier, you want to do a little bit better and that's when you start tensing up a little bit. It was a great year \u2013 1.42, I can't complain. My previous PB (personal best) was 1.44 I think, so getting down to 1.42 is pretty cool. I always thought Australia should be pretty up there. Now we've got boys that can \u2013 I don't think that 1.42 will stay long if I don't go after it. Again, I'm hoping I'm blessed with another opportunity.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSeventeen-year-old Gout Gout will make his highly anticipated debut in the men\u2019s 200-metre heat later tonight (9:43pm AEST).\n\n\n\n",

Something that is in line with the science \u2026 and a plan to get off fossil fuels,\u201d she said on this morning\u2019s program.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried of course, that the Labor Party is still just kicking the can down the road, and doing the bidding of the fossil fuel companies.\u201d\n\nHer comments come after Environment Minister Murray Watt\u2019s controversial approval to extend the North West Shelf, Australia\u2019s largest fossil fuel project, last week.\n\n\u201cWe do need an ambitious target, and we do need a plan to get out of fossil fuels, particularly fossil fuel exports. And if the prime minister did that, he\u2019d also be building a better relationship with our Pacific neighbours. And we\u2019ve seen how that\u2019s fallen over overnight, throughout this week, with Vanuatu and now PNG. The Pacific, our Pacific family are actually asking us to step up and do more.\u201d",

Zach Merrett, anyone? McClure thinks so, and that could be awkward. Here are the latest odds Nick Daicos $2.50\n\nBailey Smith $5.00\n\nJordan Dawson $6.50\n\nNoah Anderson $7.00\n\nMatt Rowell $13.00\n\nNasiah Wanganeen-Milera $51.00\n\nCaleb Serong $67.00\n\nTom Green $67.00\n\nHugh McCluggage $81.00\n\nMarcus Bontempelli $101.00\n\n(Via Sportsbet, as of Thursday morning.) The leading contenders, round by round\n\nDawson won The Age footballer of the year award and led Adelaide\u2019s stunning rise from 15th to the minor premiership (before a straight sets finals exit). He earned maximum coaches\u2019 votes in five matches and will be tough to beat. Daicos is the popular choice among Age experts. Seven of our 10 tipsters expect him to win, and Champion Data has him best on ground in nine matches. That\u2019s 27 votes right there. Catch him if you can. Anderson powered Gold Coast to September for the first time. He\u2019ll compete with Rowell for maximum votes in plenty of matches.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to look away when Smith is in action, on and off the field. He shared the AFL coaches\u2019 gong with Anderson and made the All-Australian team in his first year at the Cats. \u201cBazlenka\u201d for the Brownlow? Wanganeen-Milera, the AFL\u2019s first $2 million man, will make the leaders sweat when he surges in the final rounds. Party at the Espy if he wins it.\n\nCaleb Serong started strongly but had to cope with taggers for much of the season. However, recent history shows the Fremantle midfielder polls well and should be in the mix. What our experts are saying Jake Niall 1. Jordan Dawson\n\n2. Nick Daicos\n\nRoughie: Jeremy Cameron\n\nLoading Dawson stood out in a team without midfield star power. Daicos is a machine and will get close again, while Anderson and Rowell will take votes from each other. Caroline Wilson 1. Nick Daicos\n\n2. Noah Anderson\n\nRoughie: Jack Gunston Daicos has been a proven vote-winner in his short but brilliant career. He stood out this season when Collingwood were flying and carried the Magpies during their slump. A proven champion will prevail in a tight field.\n\nMichael Gleeson 1. Nick Daicos\n\n2. Jordan Dawson\n\nRoughie: Jai Newcombe Daicos wasn\u2019t as good as last year, but last year was ridiculous. He can poll two thirds of the votes he did in 2024 and still win. Jon Pierik 1. Nick Daicos\n\n2. Jordan Dawson\n\nRoughie: Nasiah Wanganeen-Milera\n\nDaicos has had another superb season; his ball use is second to none. This year he shouldn\u2019t have to worry about being beaten in a record count. Dawson has been central to the Crows\u2019 rise, while Wanganeen-Milera is an All-Australian and should poll strongly, particularly late. Libby Birch 1. Jordan Dawson\n\n2. Bailey Smith\n\nRoughie: Ed Richards A huge year for Adelaide and Dawson, who was named in the All-Australian side and voted AFLPA captain of the year after leading the Crows to the minor premiership. He\u2019s relentless workhorse in the middle and a composed leader \u2013 what more could you ask from him? Smith has been a flashy, creative spark who\u2019s added plenty to Geelong. Meanwhile, Ed Richards enjoyed a genuine breakout year, stepping up in the midfield \u2013 especially when \u201cthe Bont\u201d was sidelined. Sam McClure\n\n1. Noah Anderson\n\n2. Nick Daicos\n\nRoughie: Zach Merrett Daicos is clearly the best player in the comp and probably should win it, but Brownlow counts can be strange affairs. Anderson catches the eye with his inside/outside dominance and is sure to poll well in any game Gold Coast won. Bob Murphy 1. Bailey Smith\n\n2. Nick Daicos\n\nRoughie: Ed Richards Dashing runs, new kit, long hair and a bright headband point to Smith. Oh, and the Cats win heaps of games.\n\nCalum Jaspan Loading 1. Nick Daicos\n\n2. Noah Anderson\n\nRoughie: Max Holmes It\u2019s a toss-up between Anderson and Daicos, but Daicos seems like a safe choice. The umpires love him and he\u2019s probably earned one. Peter Ryan\n\n1. Nick Daicos\n\n2. Jordan Dawson\n\nRoughie: Max Holmes Daicos didn\u2019t have as good a season as he did last year but he just polls votes and will take catching. Dawson is consistently the best player in the top-of-the-ladder team, while umpires spent last season understanding how good Max Holmes is, and will reward him with votes. Andrew Wu 1. Nick Daicos\n\n2. Matt Rowell\n\nRoughie: Jeremy Cameron Daicos is a proven vote-getter who will poll in plenty of games. Rowell finished seventh last year when he didn\u2019t have an outside game and Gold Coast were battlers. With 14 bags of four or more goals, Jeremy Cameron can sneak into the top 10 at ridiculous odds.\n\nJimmy Bartel 1. Nick Daicos\n\n2. Noah Anderson\n\nRoughie: Finn Callaghan The Giants won 16 games and Finn Callaghan was their most eye-catching performer. The line-breaker could cause a Brownlow boilover. Marc McGowan 1. Matt Rowell\n\n2. Nick Daicos\n\nRoughie: Marcus Bontempelli",

Penrith\u2019s inspirational skipper has since delivered two consecutive 80-minute performances, including last week\u2019s 24-8 win against the Warriors in the opening round of the play-offs.\n\nHe has produced 93 tackles in those two games, and carried the ball 256 metres, to allay any concerns about his fitness. \u201cI had to make a million tackles last week, so it\u2019s holding up all right ... everything\u2019s all systems go,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cIt\u2019s no dramas.\u201d Asked if he would need post-season surgery, which is often required after shoulder dislocations, Yeo replied: \u201cNo. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Isaah Yeo led the Kangaroos at last year\u2019s Pacific Championships. Credit: Getty Images That means the 30-year-old lock is likely to be available to represent Australia in their three Tests in the Old Dart in October and November. It will be the first Ashes series in 22 years.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s certainly the plan, obviously,\u201d Yeo said when asked if he hoped to be available to tour. \u201cThat\u2019s all things considered, and you want to be a part of those ... you want to be a part of those big ones, particularly with sort of the history surrounded with it, and we just haven\u2019t been on a tour like that for so long. So, they\u2019re the ones you want to be a part of, and I\u2019ve certainly put my hand up for sure.\u201d Loading Yeo led Australia during a successful Pacific Championships campaign last year, skippered NSW in this year\u2019s State of Origin series, and has been co-captain in Penrith\u2019s four consecutive premiership wins. Yet he is not counting on retaining the Kangaroos\u2019 captaincy on the Ashes, saying that\u2019s a decision for new coach Kevin Walters.\n\n\u201cI just want to be on the squad first, and then I\u2019ll let Kevin figure all that out,\u201d he said. Yeo\u2019s immediate priority is Sunday\u2019s do-or-die final against Canterbury at Accor Stadium. He said there were plenty of similarities between the two sides, which is understandable given the Bulldogs signed coach Cameron Ciraldo from the Panthers in 2023, as well as a host of ex-Penrith players including Stephen Crichton, Matt Burton, Viliame Kikau and Jaeman Salmon. \u201cI just feel like we match up well with each other,\u201d Yeo said. \u201cI think we sort of both have similar styles. We want ball in play. \u201cWe back our defences both sides and ... it just makes for an exciting match-up and exactly what you want for this time of season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be hotly contested, it\u2019ll be a lot of ball and play I\u2019d imagine, and both teams backing their defence. So it\u2019ll be a wonderful challenge. I can\u2019t wait.\u201d Next season? Off-contract Kennedy is not looking beyond this week By Robert Dillon He is facing an uncertain future beyond the end of this season, but Cronulla fullback Will Kennedy says he\u2019s looking no further than the end of this week as he strives to enhance his bargaining position by helping the Sharks stay alive in 2025.\n\nKennedy, the 28-year-old who made his debut for Cronulla in 2019 and has played 132 games for the club, is off contract at the end of this campaign and has no desire to leave the Shire. Negotiations with the Sharks have been protracted, but Kennedy remains hopeful of a positive outcome, despite reports Cronulla\u2019s salary cap is stretched to the limit. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting, but I think everyone knows now that I want to stay around here,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been here since I was 18, so yeah, just whatever happens. I\u2019ll just focus on footy at the moment and I\u2019ll let all that take care of itself.\u201d Kennedy admits it is not ideal to be playing in the finals while not knowing what is in store for him next season, but he isn\u2019t \u201cgetting too stressed\u201d about the situation.\n\nWill Kennedy takes on the Roosters on Saturday night. Credit: Getty Images \u201cI think I\u2019m sort of used to it now,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just sort of waiting, if that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got to do. \u201cI\u2019ve just got to focus on what\u2019s happening now, and that\u2019s probably just footy and enjoying the company of the boys while I\u2019m here \u2026 I\u2019m not too frustrated, but probably just for my family, just not knowing what\u2019s going to happen. It would be nice to know.\u201d Kennedy, whose management have kept his options open by contacting the organisers of the proposed R360 rugby union competition, was his usual reliable self in Saturday night\u2019s 20-10 victory over the Sydney Roosters in their elimination final. It was his 25th game of the season, and he has been a model of consistency, averaging 154 running metres a game, scoring eight tries and delivering 12 try assists.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s just from learning and experience coming up through the ranks as well, having the boys around me for a while now,\u201d he said. \u201cI know my role, and I\u2019m just enjoying my footy and being happy with the boys. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201d Saturday\u2019s win against the Roosters allowed Cronulla to progress to a sudden-death final in Canberra on Saturday against a Raiders team left shattered after Sunday\u2019s golden-point loss to Brisbane in the 94th minute. Kennedy knows from personal experience how such a defeat can negatively impact a team. After Cronulla lost in golden point against North Queensland in the opening round of the 2022 play-offs, they were then thrashed by South Sydney a week later. Cronulla have won eight of their past nine games, including Saturday night\u2019s elimination final win against the Roosters. Credit: Getty Images \u201cYeah, it was a tough one for them [Canberra], and even for the Broncos, playing that long,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a final here as well, going for that long as well, so it would be a bit draining.\n\n\u201cBut I think they\u2019ll still be up for it. Finals footy, it\u2019s a lot different to just a normal season, so I think we\u2019ve just got to go there and expect anything. It\u2019s do or die for both teams.\u201d Cronulla were underdogs against the Roosters last weekend and Kennedy indicated that suited them just fine. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing it our own way, and we\u2019re just going about our business,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the main thing we\u2019ve got to do, stick to what works for us and play for each other.\u201d Kikau plays through fracture pain, twice Dan Walsh\n\nCanterbury suspect star back-rower Viliame Kikau has already played more than one full match with a fractured eye socket while also sweating the fitness of halfback Toby Sexton for their sudden-death showdown with Penrith next weekend. The Bulldogs have already lost skipper Stephen Crichton (syndesmosis) and centre Enari Tuala to a leg fracture, though Bronson Xerri will return from a concussion lay-off against the Panthers. Viliame Kikau returns to Sydney on Saturday with a swollen right eye Credit: Channel Nine Canterbury officials believe Kikau first suffered a fractured eye socket against the Sharks \u2013 he sported a black eye all of last week \u2013 rather than in the early exchanges of last Friday\u2019s clash with Melbourne. The Fijian enforcer has played through the pain for the past two weeks and is yet to be ruled out of the Panthers clash. The fracture is said to be stable and a matter of pain management for Kikau.\n\nSexton, meanwhile, is set for further scans on Monday in the hope of ruling out a sternum fracture. The Catalans-bound halfback suffered a knock to his chest against the Storm. His sternum issue adds another headache to Cameron Ciraldo\u2019s playmaking conundrum. Sexton had performed strongly following the injury to Crichton, which opened the door for him to get onto the field. Ciraldo can either keep Matt Burton and Lachlan Galvin in the halves, or shift Burton to centre for a Sexton-Galvin combination. Toby Sexton has his sternum injury examined against Melbourne. Credit: Getty Images Winger Marcelo Montoya (ankle) is a chance to return against the Panthers, a welcome result given the Bulldogs have few options in their backline beyond reserve winger Blake Wilson. Should Sexton be ruled out, out-of-favour hooker Reed Mahoney would come into contention for a bench recall. Penrith have reported a clean bill of health out of their win over the Warriors, with Nathan Cleary handing goalkicking duties to Dylan Edwards due to a cork he picked up in the second half.",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size This week\u2019s books range from fiction set in Japan\u2019s Meiji era and some rock\u2019n\u2019roll fiction to Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s revealing memoir and the secrets of birdsong. FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK I Am a Cat\n\nNatsume S\u014dseki\n\nVintage Classics, $32.99 Before cats became masters of the meme-verse, before the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, and before even its source material, T.S. Eliot\u2019s Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats (1939), there was Natsume S\u014dseki\u2019s I Am a Cat (1905-6). The satirical classic gives a cat\u2019s eye view of Japanese literati during the late Meiji period. It\u2019s told by an anonymous moggie who arrives in the household of a pseudo-intellectual, Sneaze, and makes catty observations about the professors and scholars and poets who congregate there. The Meiji era coined the Japanese word tsundoku \u2013 a term for buying books and allowing them to pile up unread \u2013 which should give you some idea of how status-obsessed these bookish humans are. Our cat narrator unsheathes its claws and takes wry swipes at every foible and flaw \u2013 from the physical loathing the humans seem to display for themselves and each other, to tensions between Western and Japanese philosophical and cultural traditions. The narrator itself isn\u2019t beyond reproach \u2013 the cat assumes it has won celebrity status after randomly photobombing a postcard \u2013 though that only adds to the charm of this cynical, surprisingly prescient satire of human failings. Fireweather\n\nMiranda Darling\n\nScribe, $29.99\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA sequel to Thunderhead (2024), Miranda Darling\u2019s Fireweather delves into the mind of a woman on the verge of \u2013 for want of a better word \u2013 madness. Or is it the world that\u2019s gone mad? In the previous book, we got a day in the life of Winona Dalloway, confined by suburban domesticity and motherhood. It fused black comedy with interior mental landscape and found itself in conversation with Virginia Woolf, among other feminist forebears. In Fireweather, we get drawn into Winona\u2019s mind as her marriage looks like ending in divorce and her children are absent. The world is on fire, literally, with black ash falling from the sky. Internally, Winona splits into multiple voices \u2013 dissociating into archetypes such as The Archer, The Nanny and The Poet \u2013 as she falls down a mental health rabbit-hole. She thinks she\u2019s sane. Increasingly, mental health professionals disagree. Darling writes feminist fiction infused with wit, intertextuality and a poetic command of language, creating a compelling, intricate internal voice that stands, too, as a critique of institutional misogyny in psychiatry. Eleanor Jones Is Playing with Fire\n\nAmy Doak\n\nPenguin, $19.99 The third in Amy Doak\u2019s award-winning Eleanor Jones series of YA mysteries (after Eleanor Jones Is Not a Murderer and Eleanor Jones Can Keep a Secret), immediately demonstrates its appeal, even to the uninitiated. Doak has created a wry and relatable adolescent narrator, at home in a gossipy world of teen crushes and high-school drama yet thrust into solving crimes. At the novel\u2019s opening, she still hasn\u2019t kissed love interest Troy, and no less importantly, there\u2019s an arsonist on the loose in Cooinda, the rural town Eleanor moved to with her mother Min in the first book. Is a spate of car thefts potentially linked to the fires? Eleanor\u2019s warned off investigating by a local cop, but trouble has a way of seeking her out and, in any event, someone must get to the bottom of the mystery before the whole of Cooinda goes up in smoke. Eleanor\u2019s an entertaining teen narrator, her circle of friends is realistically drawn, and the mix of schoolyard romance and puzzle-like detective fiction should, I imagine, make this an addictive series for an early high school audience. Hot Wax\n\nM.L. Rio\n\nWildfire, $32.99\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve lost count of how many rock\u2019n\u2019roll novels I\u2019ve read over the years, but almost without exception the genre is expected to tick two boxes. You\u2019ve got to write a love letter to the power of music, on the one hand, and a sharp indictment of the dark side of the industry, on the other. M.L. Rio\u2019s Hot Wax cleaves to the mould, though the narrative has an unexpected twist, and enough depth of character to keep it from feeling completely formulaic. The split narrative follows Suzanne from 10 years old. She\u2019s drawn to her dad\u2019s world of fast cars and electric guitars and accompanies a rock band on a concert tour, where she witnesses fame and infamy intertwining. Years later, Suzanne settles down with a dull husband, Rob, but when her father suddenly dies, she abandons suburbia for the road, determined to find out what happened. Rob isn\u2019t happy about it, planning to track Suzanne down to confront her. M.L. Rio is the author of the BookTok sensation If We Were Villains: this latest should appeal to her fans, even if it seems undistinguished to connoisseurs of rock music fiction. Slashed Beauties\n\nA. Rushby\n\nHQ, $32.99 Wax dummies made from 18th-century sex workers \u2013 so-called Anatomical Venuses \u2013 are imbued with fatal, supernatural powers of vengeance. They come to life and murder any man who dares a lustful glance. (Take that, male gaze!) Such is the conceit of A. Rushby\u2019s Slashed Beauties. In the modern day, antiques dealer Alys is intimately connected to the wax figures. Entrusted with transporting one of them safely, she seeks to prevent uncontrolled magical mayhem from being unleashed. Back in 18th-century London, we follow the fortunes of the three women whose bodies were models for the wax figures. All are involved in the sex industry. Young ingenue Eleanor falls in with Elizabeth, a kept woman who opens a high-class brothel. Entering a world of luxury and corruption alongside fellow newcomer Emily, Eleanor finds herself well-compensated, financially free, but on a dark path she cannot control. Some elements of the world-building are under-realised and the prose is largely pedestrian. If you read only for plot, however, this blend of sisterhood novel and feminist revenge fantasy might just grab you. NON-FICTION PICK OF THE WEEK Love\u2019s Labour\n\nStephen Grosz\n\nChatto & Windus, $36.99\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen I read psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz\u2019s previous book The Examined Life, I found myself wishing I could bring him my troubles. He is the kind of listener we all want. Attentive, rigorous, non-judgmental. This is not to suggest he presents himself as someone who can \u201cfix\u201d his patients\u2019 problems. Analysis, he stresses in his latest collection of case studies, Love\u2019s Labour, is a collaboration. If love\u2019s labour is \u201cthe work we must do to see clearly ourselves and our loved ones\u201d, much of that labour is a joint effort carried out in the analyst\u2019s consulting room. Take the story of Matt. His closest relationships don\u2019t feel real because he has been conditioned to repress anger and hate. When he sends Grosz a furious email saying that he doesn\u2019t like him, Grosz knows progress has been made. Then there\u2019s Ravi, who\u2019s convinced his wife is having an affair. He breaks off the analysis, allowing this delusion to ultimately ruin his love for her because he can\u2019t let go the \u201cecstasy of sanctimony\u201d. Love\u2019s labour, Grosz reminds us in this moving and insightful work, is never done. All the Way to the River\n\nElizabeth Gilbert\n\nBloomsbury, $34.99 On the surface, everything looked great. Elizabeth Gilbert\u2019s novel The Signature of All Things had shown those who dismissed her as a chick-lit lightweight after the phenomenal success of Eat, Pray, Love that she was a serious, literary writer. But beneath the surface, chaos brewed. Although happily married, Gilbert was in love with her closest friend, Rayya Elias, but couldn\u2019t admit to it. Only when Elias was diagnosed with terminal cancer did their bottled up love explode. \u201cWe were ecstatic, phosphorescent, dangerous, brilliant and full of wild courage,\u201d she writes. Until, that is, this wild ride turned into a nightmare as Elias succumbed to her cocaine addiction and Gilbert fuelled it with her addiction to love and sex. Gilbert doesn\u2019t spare herself or Elias while laying bare how abject and wretched they became. But, as a recovering addict, she believes that the truth is what sets you free. The high voltage intensity of this memoir, with its operatic declarations, is not for everyone. Apron-Sorrow/ Sovereign-Tea\n\nNatalie Harkin\n\nWakefield Press, $49.95 \u201cSovereign-Tea.\u201d There is so much packed into this poignant play on words. It speaks of the constraints on Aboriginal women in domestic servitude and of their quiet strength. Their job was, as Natalie Harkin so eloquently puts it, to \u201cclean up the colonial mess\u201d. To keep the white settlers\u2019 homes tidy, to look after their children. Even though they themselves might have been taken from their parents or had their children taken from them. The documents Harkin has retrieved from the archives lay bare the chilling and patronising mentality of the colonial bureaucratic mind. A State Lady\u2019s report on one Aboriginal woman in domestic service reads: \u201cYou need firm handling. You must realise that you cannot have your own way always in this world\u201d. Set against this exercise of state power are the women\u2019s stories and the memories of their descendants. Stories imbued with sadness but also with resourcefulness and dignity. Stories of artistic and musical talent, of determination and spirit. Here, their labour is made visible, their voices heard.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "It is Frank\u2019s most harrowing experiences that she demands her editor include. But Bow Tie wants to appeal to young readers. He wants her innocence retained. Loading Whose truth gets told is a key theme in the play, but it\u2019s presented as a straw-man argument between the well-realised Frank and a caricatured editor. Playwright Ron Elisha was inspired to write this polemical piece after reading an essay by American Dara Horn that questioned why the Diary of Anne Frank, with its hopeful final line, has been so successful. Horn argued that the diary lets readers off the hook, offering facile forgiveness while bypassing darker complexities. The Frank presented on stage is far from the poster girl for forgiveness. She\u2019s filled with rage and hate at what she\u2019s experienced.\n\nThis is a demanding show in which the versatile Fishman plays all the roles, including Bow Tie and the camp guard. She is a powerful and nuanced Frank, as she evolves from innocent teenager to a woman burning with fury and fighting to tell her unvarnished tale. Amanda Brooke Lerner\u2019s direction makes shifts of time and place clear, and the most confronting scenes are sensitively handled. Jacob Battista\u2019s static set evokes the three locations with a sparse wooden bed conjuring the camp. At one side is the Amsterdam attic, on the other the editor\u2019s book-lined office and wooden desk. The location and tone shifts are aided by Finnegan Comte-Harvey\u2019s effective lighting. This is a bleak, thoughtful piece that comes against a backdrop of rising conflict, not only in the Middle East. It offers no easy solutions or plea for peace. Yet if we shred the idea of a humanity capable of good, where does that leave us? In a world unable to escape our escalating savagery.\n\nTHEATRE\n\nTRENT DALTON\u2019S LOVE STORIES\n\nRiverside Theatres, September 12\n\nUntil September 20\n\nReviewed by KATE PRENDERGAST\n\n\u2605\u2605\u00bd If you chanced to walk by a Brisbane street corner in 2021, you may have come across Trent Dalton, Walkley-winning journalist and our nation\u2019s current literary golden boy. He\u2019s sitting behind a sky-blue 1960s Olivetti typewriter with a sign reading \u201csentimental writer collecting love stories\u201d. With (at least according to the dramatic interpretation) crinkly eyes and a boyish smile, he invites you and every other regular bloke and missus passing by to tell him their own personal love story. Those true-blue anecdotes became Love Stories, the book, which was adapted by Tim Garry into a cine-theatrical and wildly popular Brisbane Festival and QPAC show. It is playing in Parramatta this month on its five-city tour, directed by Sam Strong. Live video is a necessary distraction and stimulation. Credit:\n\nIt was of course Boy Swallows Universe that catapulted Dalton to literary stardom. Writing in relentless aphorism, with plots that heave with romanticism and old-school Aussie nostalgia, reading Dalton feels like a bad-taste populist parody, as unpleasant as popping candy. That\u2019s just one opinion, though, and seemingly a minority one. Along with the vulture reviewers, Love Stories\u2019 PR team invited a flock of book influencers to opening night, with a shameless plug of Swallows in the play itself. Loading Jason Klarwein is our dramatised Dalton, sitting at that street corner with his Olivetti, ear cocked towards the plangent sound of the common man\u2019s heartstrings. The play is structured as a relentless whirlwind of bite-size profundities and platitudes, with dozens of characters relaying their deepest truths, then disappearing into the skin of another through their respective actor. All stories get a screen subtitle in large, typewriter font. Live video that captures both on-stage actors and sometimes the audience is a necessary distraction and stimulation. The play would feel very flat without this technical virtuosity, which sometimes deploys overlays, delays and other special effects, and makes much use of the dramatic close-up. There is also some contemporary dance.\n\nLove Stories on stage reproduces the numbing sensation of watching a TikTok feed with the algorithm set to \u201cBig Feelings\u201d. There are stories of lovers who die in car crashes, and lovers who propose in flash mobs; love as a perfect sub/dom pairing, and love as a Rwandan genocide orphan found under a tree. There\u2019s love as childhood friendship, and love as finding \u201cthree good things\u201d to survive each day. That last story, inhabited by Hsin-Ju Ely, was almost moving. And it\u2019s true the cast of 10 makes the most of the material, with standouts in Rashidi Edward, Valerie Bader and Kirk Page. The show is not without self-awareness. The narrative through-line is character-Dalton\u2019s own love story \u2013 which is far past the honeymoon stage. With his wife (Anna McGahan) understandably frustrated at the sacrifices she\u2019s made so her husband can bum around Brisbane\u2019s CBD and listen attentively to everyone but her, she\u2019s put herself in therapy. This central story provides welcome continuity and some sharp rebuttals to the schmaltz. It all wraps up nicely by the end of course, with a wedding ring remade. What\u2019s not to love? See previous.\n\nTHEATRE\n\nTRUE WEST\n\nEnsemble Theatre, September 12\n\nUntil October 11\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd Simon Maiden\u2019s Lee creates a tension thick with latent violence, a black hole of negative energy. His blank eyes stare with hate and resentment. \u201cYou go ahead, like I wasn\u2019t even here,\u201d he tells his brother Austin (Darcy Kent), who\u2019s trying to write a screenplay, but Austin may as well try to imagine a world without sibling rivalry. In Sam Shepard\u2019s supreme 1980 play True West, Lee, the elder brother, is the daredevil, wastrel and lost soul capable of physical violence and minor criminality. He lobs in on the college-educated, mild-mannered Austin, who\u2019s house-minding \u2013 plant-minding, primarily \u2013 for their mother while she\u2019s in Alaska. Austin\u2019s using her southern California bungalow as a writer\u2019s retreat to nail down a love story that already has interest from a producer, Saul (James Lugton). James Lugton, Simon Maiden and Darcy Kent in True West. Credit: Prudence Upton But hard-drinking Lee has a story of his own, and he gazumps Austin by selling Saul on the idea of a modern-day western that\u2019s one big chase sequence \u2013 a metaphor (although he doesn\u2019t know it) for the lifelong game of chase the brothers have been playing.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine three consecutive nights of high-calibre theatre more disparate than the oneiric Orlando (Belvoir St), the bluegrass poignancy of Bright Star (Hayes Theatre) and then True West. If you only see one, make it this. It\u2019s directed by Iain Sinclair, who did the Ensemble\u2019s memorable The Caretaker three years ago, and there are overlaps between Pinter and Shepard. They both like characters who struggle to communicate, and whose frustration breeds aggression. Shepard consummately structures his play so that when Austin joins Lee on his drinking binge (after Saul favours Lee\u2019s movie idea), the gulf between their characters shrinks until the similarities seem to outweigh the differences. But that only masks underlying resentments. Maiden and Kent are riveting, walking the seesaw of power imbalance between them. There\u2019s a moment late on when Kent is on his knees, staring up at Maiden, his performance so potent you can see in his eyes the ghost of the hero-worship he once had for his brother. Lugton\u2019s Saul is the sunbeam of humour blazing through the storm clouds in a wide-collared paisley shirt and perfectly pressed cream trousers (courtesy of designer Simone Romaniuk). Lugton adds matching bonhomie and bravado \u2013 at least in Saul\u2019s dealings with Austin. Lee can\u2019t so easily be tamed by smiling promises. Alas for the brilliant Maiden, a medical emergency forced him from the stage near the end, halting the show for 20 minutes, after which Sinclair read Lee (in costume), and commendably saw the fraternal war to its inevitable conclusion.\n\nThis includes the unexpected return of the boys\u2019 mother, played by Vanessa Downing, who probably didn\u2019t have to work too hard to be in a state of shock after what had happened to Maiden, and who completed a stellar cast fulfilling Shepard\u2019s manic vision: a snapshot of an America that can tear itself apart. MUSIC\n\nA Musical Awakening\n\nAustralian Chamber Orchestra, September 17\n\nReviewed by PETER McCALLUM\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd The program opened and closed with musical meditations on hymn-like melodies that evoked a search for serenity and transcendence that became the concert\u2019s dominant theme. The first piece, Illuminations, grew out of a soundscape by Erkki Veltheim, which could be heard in the foyers and hall as listeners arrived. Birdsong, wispy rustling and cavernous wind sounds created the ambience of daybreak and moved seamlessly into a performance by recorder player Genevieve Lacey of Hildegard von Bingen\u2019s 12th-century chant Ave, Generosa. Lacey was quietly accompanied by ACO members playing sustained notes, scurrying figures and fragments of the hymn, which lingered like shapes imprinted on the retina after the object has gone.\n\nGenevieve Lacey and theorbo player Simon Martyn-Ellis. Credit: Charlie Kinross On the Nature of Daylight by Max Richter continued without a break with theorbo player Simon Martyn-Ellis providing delicate decoration and incisive bass notes to a chorale-like harmonic progression that began on cellos and swelled to the entire string orchestra. Wiima by Finnish composer Jaakko Kuusisto (whose Cello Concerto the concert\u2019s director Timo-Veikko Valve played to such striking effect earlier this year) broke abruptly from the meditative mood with an initial jabbing, thick chord. This turbulent work juxtaposed surging wind-like textures with penetrating solos and rhapsodically expressive recitatives, closing with an angular rhythmic passage that culminated in a frantic expressive moment. David Lang\u2019s flute and echo (receiving a world premiere) was, on the surface, exactly what the label said. Lacey played a hauntingly resonant arabesque on one of the lower pitched recorders, which was echoed with some details trimmed by lead violinist Helena Rathbone and then further abridged by the rest of the orchestra. Lacey retained rounded warmth to the sound as she played progressively higher instruments and the \u201cechoes\u201d fragmented further. When, at the end, she returned to the opening arabesque the surrounding echoes drifted off with their own textures as though cut free.\n\nAfter interval Melody Eotvos\u2019s Meraki (a Greek word meaning, in her words, when you \u201cput something of yourself\u201d into what you are doing), built up a dark bed of sound from low strings. The piece also had hymn-like moments mixed with passages of tussling rhythmic vigour. In Imaginary Cities: A Baroque Fantasy , Veltheim created another soundscape against which Lacey led the orchestra in music from the Venetian Baroque by Monteverdi, Vivaldi and Strozzi. It provided an opportunity to hear Lacey chirp with agile virtuosity on a high-pitched recorder in Vivaldi\u2019s Recorder Concerto in C major. The closing work, Beethoven\u2019s Heiliger Dankgesang (Holy Song of Thanksgiving) from the String Quartet in A minor, Opus 132, took on a sad and solemn significance as a tribute to the passing last Saturday of John Painter. Beginning his career in the SSO under Eugene Goossens, Painter is fondly remembered and revered by generations of Australian musicians, as cellist, teacher, Director of the NSW State Conservatorium (as it was then called) and the Canberra School of Music and as founder of the ACO fifty years ago.\n\nMUSICAL THEATRE\n\nBRIGHT STAR\n\nHayes Theatre, September 11\n\nUntil October 5\n\nReviewed by JOHN SHAND\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Don\u2019t necessarily judge a musical by its soundtrack. The original Broadway cast recording of Bright Star suggested I was in for a long night. The music and lyrics, by Steve Martin and Edie Brickell, are in a bluegrass/country vein, evoking the setting in North Carolina\u2019s Blue Ridge Mountains. The songs sounded samey, the singing ordinary, and perhaps there was a good reason why nobody had penned a bluegrass musical before. But that didn\u2019t allow for Steve Martin\u2019s book, with its sharply drawn characters, wit and poignancy \u2013 as well as unabashed melodrama \u2013 melodrama having kept country ballads simmering since folks first donned cowboy boots. Bright Star is Sport for Jove\u2019s first musical. Credit: Robert Catto It also didn\u2019t allow for the Broadway album\u2019s singing being completely outgunned in a production devised, improbably, by leading Shakespeare company, Sport for Jove. Why, I\u2019d wondered, would Sport for Jove lower the bar to hick musical theatre? Now I understand.\n\nAlthough this is the company\u2019s first musical, music has long been key to its Shakespeare productions, and Bright Star burnishes rather than clouds its reputation. Directors Miranda Middleton and Damien Ryan and musical director Alec Steedman have assembled a 16-person ensemble, almost all of whom act, sing, dance and play. It seemed only three band members didn\u2019t have a character to play, and only one cast member didn\u2019t play an instrument. That was Hannah McInerney in the pivotal role of Alice Murphy. She has two especially potent songs, Please Don\u2019t Take Him and At Long Last, and they would test the ability of any female singer not to become shrill while squeezing out the show\u2019s emotional marrow. McInerney was superlative \u2013 and also acted her socks off as a literary magazine editor whose newborn babe was ripped from her arms 23 years before. The show zigzags between 1946 and 1923 with an abruptness that initially teases, but we get our heads around it, and learn to trust Martin\u2019s storytelling and invest in his detailed characters. In an ensemble of co-leads, the expert actors included Cameron Bajraktarevic-Hayward, Kaya Byrne, Jack Green, Sean van Doornum, Katrina Retallick and Rupert Reid. Special mentions must go to Deirdre Khoo, who maximises the minor role of Lucy most entertainingly, and Genevieve Goldman (Margo), who has an ideal voice for the material, and who, upon learning that her love interest, Billy, is being published by Alice\u2019s magazine, performs a little dance of exquisite ecstasy. The lively choreography by Shannon Burns dovetails with the whip-crack directing, including such joy as a door held up to be knocked on, which, upon being opened, magically becomes a dining table. Designer Isabel Hudson cunningly implied the prevailing rusticity while accommodating 16 performers on the tight stage.\n\nYes, the melodrama undid certain moments, and the redemptive storyline was predictable, yet all was animated by the music\u2019s high energy under Steedman\u2019s direction and Victoria Falconer\u2019s onstage supervision. MUSICAL THEATRE\n\nHERE YOU COME AGAIN\n\nTheatre Royal, September 13\n\nUntil October 18\n\nReviewed by JOYCE MORGAN\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605 The towering blonde wigs, the eyelashes, the rhinestones. And that\u2019s just the drag queens in the front stalls. This fanfest was always going to draw Dolly Parton\u2019s most flamboyant admirers.\n\nIt\u2019s more tribute show than fully fledged musical, so don\u2019t look for insights into Dolly or even much about the life of the fiercely talented singer/songwriter, Tennessee-born musician. Tricia Paoluccio delivers an impeccable, sparkly Dolly. Credit: Cameron Grant Fortunately, the star of this show delivers an impeccable, sparkly Dolly. Tricia Paoluccio captures Dolly\u2019s clear, bright voice, southern drawl and warm-hearted spirit. Whether acting lines or singing from the extensive Parton songbook, Paoluccio channels her idol. Threaded through this jukebox musical is a slender story about Dolly-tragic Kevin. Set amid the COVID pandemic, the 40-year-old has moved into his parents\u2019 attic. Kevin\u2019s career is on the skids, and his boyfriend has dumped him. Surrounded by stockpiled toilet rolls (remember that pandemic phenomenon?), Kevin is hoofing into the booze and Cheezels.\n\n\u201cWhat would Dolly do?\u201d he wonders. And, hey presto, she materialises \u2013 a vision in a pink frock and rhinestones. This is Dolly as fairy godmother. She\u2019s come to set Kevin\u2019s world to rights, help him restore his confidence and impart some homespun wisdom. What follows is a string of Parton numbers, her big hits \u2013 Here You Come Again, Jolene, Islands in the Stream, I Will Always Love You \u2013 and some lesser-known. These were well delivered, if not well integrated into the story. Taking a musical icon and spinning a tale around that figure can work brilliantly, as Titanique showed with its conceit that Celine Dion was on the doomed ship. But to succeed, the writing needs to be sharp and the story fleshed out. Here, the sections between the music sagged, especially in the first half as Kevin wallowed endlessly in his misery. As Kevin whined and Dolly retorted with more homespun wisdom than a crate of Hallmark greetings cards, by interval the repetition was deflating.",

I looked inside the offcut rolls Camilla had used and found the phone numbers for the Italian mills, so, in the middle of the night, I\u2019d be calling Italy, trying to order fabric.\n\nMarc: In 2003, at 21, Camilla was studying fashion design. I was 23 and doing an engineering degree, but I was just as interested in her course. Her graduating collection won her a scholarship to do her master\u2019s in Italy. She was also invited to show at Australian Fashion Week. She called and said, \u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d I said, \u201cWe\u2019ve always talked about doing something together. Why not start a brand?\u201d\n\nMarc Freeman, 46, and Camilla Freeman-Topper, 43, are the creative siblings behind the fashion label, Camilla and Marc. A shared childhood loss led to their campaign to help save women from an early death.\n\nOur family wasn\u2019t in the fashion business at all. They\u2019re doctors and lawyers, but from her early teens, Camilla was in love with fashion. We\u2019d go to all-age concerts and Camilla would make her own outfits. She always looked very cool \u2013 lots of short skirts. It was the \u201990s and grunge [was popular]. She liked hanging out with my friends, and ended up marrying one of them.\n\nAll our stand-up rows finished by the age of about eight, but of course, as siblings and business partners, we\u2019ve had every disagreement you could possibly have. If you observed our conversations in a business setting, you might think they were \u201crobust\u201d, but we move on quickly. Long ago, we made a policy of \u201cthe best argument wins\u201d, and have stuck to it.\n\nOutside business, we holiday together and have one or two family dinners a week, or social things. We\u2019ve both got three children but hers are much older, so she\u2019s very good at giving advice. Our partners handle our sibling relationship very well. We all joke about it. Sometimes Camilla\u2019s husband, Dave, gets called Marc, or my wife, Nicole, gets called Camilla.\n\nI was 13 and Camilla was 11 when our mum passed away from ovarian cancer at 42. She was ill for a long time and our parents had been honest with us, but when she actually passed, it was a huge loss. One day you\u2019ve got your mum, and the next you haven\u2019t. It would have been particularly hard for Camilla. Dad was a good father but outnumbered. We weren\u2019t bad kids, but he was strict and we pushed the envelope.\n\nAs we came up to our mother\u2019s age, we started looking into the best way to help with ovarian cancer research.

        "text": "Transport authorities in the country's most populous state are reminding the public of a little-known road rule when it comes to driving through traffic lights.\n\nWhile most motorists are confident with the basics of red and green lights, some remain confused when faced with a flashing amber arrow. For some, it\u2019s instinctive to slam on the brakes, while others assume it\u2019s the same as a green light \u2014 but both assumptions can be dangerous if pedestrians are still crossing.\n\n\"Ever wondered what these yellow flashing lights mean?\" Transport for New South Wales asked online on Thursday. \"This is known as a pelican crossing, it\u2019s when a pedestrian crossing is at a set of traffic lights. Most pelican crossings have the same signals as other traffic lights, but some feature the flashing yellow.\"\n\nWhat are pelican crossings?\n\nThe clarification is vital, as misunderstandings at pelican crossings can put pedestrians at risk. The yellow flashing signal is designed to keep traffic flowing without compromising safety, but only if drivers understand their obligations.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"It means when the yellow starts to flash, you can drive through the crossing if there are no pedestrians and it is safe to do so,\" TfNSW said.\n\nA pelican crossing is a type of pedestrian light-controlled crossing commonly found at intersections and busy roads across Australia. The name is actually an abbreviation of \"pedestrian light-controlled\", and it refers to signals that allow people on foot to stop traffic so they can cross safely.\n\nUnlike standard traffic lights that follow fixed cycles, pelican crossings are usually activated by pedestrians pressing a button. Once triggered, the lights change to red for vehicles, giving pedestrians a chance to walk across the road.\n\nWhat makes pelican crossings distinctive is their flashing amber (yellow) phase. Instead of staying red until the lights reset, the signals begin to flash amber, telling drivers they may proceed \u2014 but only if the crossing is clear of people.\n\nDo you have a story tip?

        "text": "Solar power is now the cheapest form of electricity in most countries, including New Zealand, and its global uptake is growing exponentially.\n\nSo far, New Zealand\u2019s adoption of solar electricity generation has been slower than elsewhere, but it is accelerating quickly. Scaling up installation could help reduce high consumer energy prices and meet New Zealand\u2019s emissions budgets.\n\nBased on current policies, New Zealand is at risk of exceeding its emissions budget for the period from 2026 to 2030, and current plans are insufficient to stay within the subsequent five-year budget up to 2035.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Climate Change Commission estimates solar combined with battery storage could cut 3.9 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions between 2031 and 2035.\n\nThis is important, as a major part of the government\u2019s plan for cutting emissions over the next five years rested on a carbon capture project at the Kapuni gas field, which seems to have fallen through.\n\nNew Zealand is also facing an energy shortage, leading to high electricity prices. But solar could be part of the solution because global reductions in the price of panels mean residential solar is now likely the cheapest option for households.\n\nSolar on the rise\n\nThe solar energy reaching Earth each hour is roughly equivalent to a year of humankind\u2019s global energy consumption.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis is not to say our current energy demand should be the target. We need to reduce consumption and use energy more efficiently, even as we continue the shift to more renewable power generation.\n\nBut a small fraction of sunlight can go a long way and many countries are taking advantage of this. For example, a consumer-led solar revolution is happening in Pakistan in response to longstanding energy supply problems. This year, solar became the largest source of electricity in Pakistan, surging to 25% of generation from about 5% just three years ago.\n\nThe uptake of solar electricity generation is also growing in New Zealand, with a significant uptick in projects for both utility-scale solar farms and household installations.\n\nNew Zealand has five large-scale solar farms in operation, and many more in the pipeline (nine at delivery stage, 33 under investigation). We also have more than 65,000 residential solar installations, up from about 7,500 a decade ago.\n\nDespite the rapid growth in recent years, this is still a relatively low adoption rate compared to some other countries, with only about 3-4% of homes having solar installed.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nA frequent argument against solar electricity generation is that it is intermittent. But solar panels can use hot water cylinders or batteries to store energy for later use.\n\nAnd while New Zealand may not get quite as much sunshine as other countries, our existing renewable generation and hydro-lake storage mean we don\u2019t have to invest as much in batteries to buffer intermittent generation.\n\nAlso, the flip side of intermittent power sources is that they turn back on \u2013 fossil fuels can only be used once.\n\nManaging solar at scale\n\nThe energy and emissions-cutting benefits of solar generation are well quantified. Solar panels generate the amount of energy required to manufacture them in less than two years, compared with a total lifetime of about 30 years.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt takes slightly longer to pay back the carbon emissions from their manufacture in New Zealand than elsewhere, because we already have a comparatively high proportion of renewable electricity generation. The carbon payback is faster if solar is used in ways that directly displace fossil fuels (for example, electricity from gas or coal) or if the panels are manufactured in places with low carbon intensity (low emissions per unit of economic activity or energy produced).\n\nThere is still work to do. We need to address practical challenges such as effective grid integration and storage, as well as social issues such as ensuring that low-income households aren\u2019t disadvantaged.\n\nGlobally, the mining of raw materials for solar panels is a key issue, and we need to ensure ethical supply chains and labour practises associated with materials and manufacture. Ultimately, we need to reach a system where solar panels are recycled to avoid the need for indefinite mining, and to keep panels out of landfills.\n\nThis goal looks promising. Solar panel recycling is an active area of research and already possible, although not yet profitable.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAs the uptake of solar accelerates, New Zealand should make sure suitable policies are in place. In terms of materials, we should require recycling of solar panels. On the social side, we should ensure support for low-income households and consider incentives for solar installations on rental properties.\n\nResearchers are also exploring next-generation solar power with lower energy and material demands in their manufacture. In most commercial solar panels, the dominant contribution to manufacturing emissions is the silicon \u201cactive layer\u201d. There are multiple alternatives to silicon and new technologies use different materials for the active layer.\n\nFor example, my research focuses on solution-printable organic semiconductors. These materials absorb light very strongly, which means the active layer is about a thousand times thinner than in a silicon solar panel. A kilogram of material can cover more than 5,000 square metres.\n\nIt will take time for these new technologies to reach the same level of development as today\u2019s solar panels. They will likely first enter the market as complementary products such as lightweight installations on low load-bearing surfaces (warehouse roofs) and in building-integrated applications.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nEconomically viable solar energy generation is a triumph of long-term scientific and engineering development that began in the 1950s and is poised to play a key role in decarbonisation. New Zealand needs to think about how to manage this technology at scale if we want to make the most of this opportunity.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation.
