It's probably not the admin.\n\nDeciding how you're going to take money overseas is one of those tasks that can seem overwhelming.\n\nHere's what experts have to say about your options while travelling.\n\nWhat to know about using cash\n\nIf you're planning to use physical currency overseas, Angel Zhong, a professor of finance at RMIT University in Naarm/Melbourne, says you will often get a better exchange rate (converting your Australian currency into local currency) once you've reached your holiday destination.\n\nAngel Zhong says you should notify your bank and check any fees that will apply overseas If you plan to use an existing card. (Supplied: Angel Zhong)\n\nWhile converting cash into foreign currency in Australia is possible, services in convenient locations (such as the airport) are typically more expensive.\n\nProfessor Zhong says she wouldn't carry thousands of dollars' worth of currency around on holiday with digital payment so widely accessible.\n\nAlso, if you're leaving or entering Australia with more than $10,000 in cash, it needs to be declared.\n\nCan I use my existing credit card or debit card?\n\nIn many cases you can use an existing credit card or debit card while travelling overseas.\n\nAustralian consumer advocacy group Choice says \"Visa and Mastercard credit cards are accepted almost everywhere for purchases and cash withdrawals\".\n\nProfessor Zhong says it can be convenient to use your ordinary debit card or credit card, but you would \"usually incur some foreign transaction cost\".\n\nBefore using an existing card overseas, she suggests checking the terms and conditions. We'll go into this in more detail shortly.\n\nAnother option Choice highlights is low-fee debit cards \"that don't charge a currency conversion fee\" with a competitive exchange rate set by Visa or Mastercard.\n\nHelpful definitions: The exchange rate is the price at which the currency of one country can be exchanged for the currency of another.\n\nis the price at which the currency of one country can be exchanged for the currency of another.

ASIC says charges may include \"a foreign currency conversion fee, an overseas transaction charge or an additional cash advance fee (for credit cards)\".\n\nAgain, being across the terms and conditions of cards is key.\n\nWhile some cards have no foreign transaction fees, Professor Zhong says \"it could be the case that their conversion rates are high\".\n\nIt can be difficult to compare exchange rates between lenders and their different cards (including travel money cards) because it varies from day to day.\n\nShe says comparison websites may help.\n\nHow travel money cards work\n\nA travel money card, travel debit card or travel cash card is another option offered by banks and other lenders, such as airlines and travel agents.\n\nAn ASIC spokesperson says, \"You can add money in your preferred currency to most travel money cards before you leave Australia\" and \"most allow you to top up your card with extra currency if you need it while you're travelling.\"\n\nA prepaid travel card may even help you stick to your getaway budget and manage exchange rates because it can be loaded with a locked-in exchange rate before you depart.\n\nHow credit card points work Photo shows Someone holding three credit cards with one hand and selecting one with the other. If credit card point programs are a mystery to you, here's what you need to know.\n\nChoice notes that travel money cards can have a higher exchange rate margin (or more expensive mark-up), and a no-fee debit card may be a better option.\n\nTravel cards \"are better suited to longer trips \u2026 [and] usually won't be worth getting if you're only taking a one-off short trip, as some come with fees for closing or inactivity\".\n\nIf you're withdrawing cash overseas, Choice says a travel debit card or travel money card is generally a better option than a credit card \u2014 which can involve a cash advance fee and high interest rates\n\nProfessor Zhong says you need to set up these cards before you travel, so you'll need to be more organised (compared to using one you already have).\n\nWhile your normal credit or debit card may have a high credit limit, such as $5,000 a travel card will often have a limit of $500 or $1,000, Professor Zhong says.\n\nThis means travel money cards aren't usually a good candidate for hotel security deposits, as a pending charge could leave you without access to your money.\n\nChoice also advises checking that a card supports the currency you'll need. Not every card will work with every currency.\n\nThis article contains general information only.

        "text": "As far as Jarome Luai is concerned, there are only two kinds of people on a rugby league pitch, even if he's facing Nathan Cleary.\n\nHe said as much before the last time he played against Cleary, ahead of the 2022 World Cup final, a showdown the two will wage in the NRL for the first time when the Panthers face the Tigers on Sunday.\n\n\"We're competitors through and through and it's going to be a great battle against one of my boys. But out there on the field, there's no friends \u2014 only brothers and enemies,\" Luai said.\n\n\"I'm always going to look at it that way.\"\n\nLuai is the kind of player who talks and lives in absolutes, but if anyone could be both brother and enemy to him it might be Cleary.\n\nThey first competed against each other a long time ago and Luai was the better prospect when they were boys \u2014 Cleary himself has acknowledged as much many times before, as will anyone who's been at Penrith long enough to remember the two of them running around for St Mary's and Penrith Brothers, and then for the club's junior rep sides.\n\nLuai won plenty of those early contests as well. When they first wore the black jerseys together as Under 16s players in 2013, it was Luai who started at halfback with Cleary first stuck on the bench before getting a start at hooker.\n\nLuai (left) and Cleary (second from left) have been playing together since they were boys. (Supplied. )\n\nEventually, they combined for the first time in the halves later that season, and once they did it was clear their games were made for each other because even back then they were a mix of the iron will and the loudest voice, the light and the heat.\n\nThe following seasons are when Cleary surged ahead \u2014 three years after he couldn't beat out Luai in a junior team, he was starting for Penrith in the big league at 18 and looking good doing it.\n\nBy the time they partnered in the halves in the NRL for the first time in 2019, Cleary had already three finals series and a winning Origin campaign under his belt, as well as all the prestige and pressure that comes with being anointed as one of rugby league's young Messiahs. For Luai, it was just his ninth NRL game.\n\nThat first match was against Parramatta, six years and two weeks ago at the same ground where they'll face off this Sunday. Back then, the Panthers were dead last on the ladder and talk was that Cleary could be in danger of losing his spot for New South Wales.\n\nIt was a tough watch. Calling it one for the purists would offend the purists and it's strange, after what they've become, to go back and see a time when Luai and Cleary were the incomplete versions of themselves.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nCleary is determined and dogged, but the game always seems a bit beyond his reach. He is grasping out desperately but cannot seize and control it the way he does so easily now.\n\nCompared to the bulletproof confidence and electricity he exudes so easily now, Luai is positively demure \u2014 he mainly shifts the ball from side to side, doesn't run it once and kicks it only twice.\n\nBut one of those kicks came late, and it took a rebound off a Parramatta defender right into Cleary's path for him to score what would be the winning try. It doesn't look like much, but once you know what happened next it's a harbinger of doom.\n\nThis rebounded kick in a sloppy, forgettable game is the first time Luai and Cleary clicked together in first grade and that's a clicking that didn't stop until they parted ways after last year's grand final as the most successful club halves combination of the NRL era.\n\nIn the first few premiership years, Cleary fed off Luai's confidence while Luai excelled with the space Cleary learned to provide. Watching them together is to see two players in perfect harmony with one another.\n\nAs the run of titles continued and their games became more complex, each began to show more of the other. Cleary learned to add more and more flourishes and subtleties to his rock-solid fundamentals as Luai learned to take the team around the park more effectively without blunting his own prodigious attacking gifts.\n\nThat transformation helped drive Penrith to immortality because it meant each learned to live without the other and in a world where most teams are a strained halfback's hamstring away from collapsing, having two playmakers who can shine independently as well as together is close to priceless.\n\nTheir combination took them to greatness but to stay there they had to be as effective apart as they could be together and in the last two years they have proven they can.\n\nCleary has played many great games in his life and has many more to come but the final stages of the 2023 grand final will likely always be his finest hour, due in no small part to Luai succumbing to a shoulder injury and the weight of destiny falling almost solely on the halfback.\n\nHow Nathan Cleary created his masterpiece Photo shows Nathan Cleary Brisbane had Penrith dead to rights with 20 minutes left in the grand final but they gave Nathan Cleary just enough time to cement his legend.\n\nLikewise, with hamstring and shoulder problems slowing Cleary down, last year it was Luai who came to the fore as the side's top dog, running them around the park in a style all his own.\n\nBy the time the finals started, Luai (eight) had played nearly as many games at halfback as Cleary had (ten) and the Panthers were ensconced in the top four and ready for yet another premiership tilt, which they duly converted into a title that felt like it ran on muscle memory.\n\nThings are different now for Penrith. They miss Luai and James Fisher-Harris as they have not missed any of the other stars who have departed through the premiership years.\n\nThey miss Luai's energy, his focus, his ability to channel his competitiveness towards victory and to inspire such efforts in others as much as they miss his skill, his cunning and his ability to work both with and without Cleary.\n\nThe Panthers only moved off the bottom of the ladder last week and with a heavy Origin representation they cannot afford to drop many more games if they want to make the finals, especially against a side like the Tigers who are also fixing to be part of the logjam at the end of the top eight.\n\nCleary is still great \u2014 his fingerprints were all over last week's win against Parramatta, as they have been for most of Penrith's best moments this year. But with so many of their players so unfamiliar with such hard times what the Panthers wouldn't give for Luai to supercharge them, to remind them of who they are, to send a bolt of lightning up their arm and get the angry blood pumping again.\n\nLuai is living in a new reality at Wests Tigers. (Getty Images: Ian Hitchcock)\n\nThat is exactly what Luai is fighting hard to give his new club. At the Tigers he is starting again with a club stuck way down in the hole, trying to teach players young and old how to be great which is a lesson as hard to teach as it is to learn.\n\nThis is a club still in transition, still building itself up after years in the doldrums.\n\nThey have made progress this year and Luai has been a big part of it but after three straight losses and the Lachlan Galvin saga the Tigers need a win and they need it bad.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nWhich means Luai and Cleary back where they were when they first locked horns on suburban fields across Sydney's west all those years ago.\n\nTheir only previous meeting as stars was at Old Trafford in front of 60,000 with a World Cup on the line and Cleary's Australian side got the better of Luai and Samoa.\n\nBut this one is more familiar to them both because it's a battle of the weekly desperation that they know so well, the knife fight in the mud that makes all the bigger days possible. Cleary and Luai both know that finals are the end of the story but wins like this are how you get there.\n\nTheir mighty wills, which were united so many times through the history they made together, are now fixed on the other and for the first time in their club colours they want the same thing and only one of them can have it.\n\nBrothers fight all the time but so do enemies and after the history Cleary and Luai lived together they really can be both, even if it's just for 80 minutes at a time.",

        "text": "For Onehunga Mata'uiau, rugby has always been about skill, discipline, and controlled contact.\n\nThat's why the former Manu Samoa player and seasoned coach sees the Run It Straight craze sweeping Pacific communities as a dangerous distortion of the game he loves.\n\nBacked by former and current rugby stars Manu Vatuvei, Chanel Harris-Tavita, George Burgess, Nemani Nadolo and UFC's Carlos Ulberg, and attracting hundreds of thousands of followers online, Run It Straight sees players charging at each other like rugby front rowers, to \"dominate\" their opponent.\n\nBut as the online hype has grown, so too have the risks.\n\nThe social media-driven craze made international headlines late last month when 19-year-old Ryan Satterthwaite died in New Zealand after suffering head injuries in an impromptu contest.\n\nOnehunga Mata'uiau says the challenge is undoing the work of coaches. (Supplied: Onehunga Mata'uiau)\n\nSpeaking just before that incident, veteran coach Mata'uiau had told ABC's Pacific Pulse he feared a tragedy was inevitable in a format where collision, not evasion, is the goal.\n\n\"As coaches and game developers, we make sure there is technique and players are not reckless \u2026 we teach our kids how to tackle properly instead of taking the head off,\" he said.\n\n\"[Run It Straight] revolves the game around rugby, but the principle of our game is not that.\n\n\"We never trained to knock each other out like that, where you have to smash someone at a hundred miles per hour.\n\n\" I would hate to have to sit in front of a mourning family and tell them we should have thought long and hard about safety. \"\n\nIn May, Run It safety spokesperson Billy Coffey revealed the sport has a concussion rate of around 20 per cent, noting that two concussions at a recent event were caused by players using \"illegal\" head-first techniques.\n\nAs pulverising hits flood social media, the spectacle is also drawing criticism for glorifying \"harmful forms of masculinity\".\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nWhat is Run It Straight?\n\nSome Pacific Islanders who grew up in the 1990s trace Run It Straight back to their childhoods in the Australian and New Zealand diaspora.\n\n\"We'd make our own fun after to'ona'i (Sunday lunch) by playing games like bull rush or Run It Straight,\" associate professor Lefaoali'i Dr Dion Enari said.\n\nOnce a backyard pastime, it has transformed into a high-impact combat event drawing a legion of online fans, families, community vendors, and influencers.\n\nFrom the polished, star-studded RUNIT Championship League to the grassroots Run It Straight 24, participants face off one-on-one in a tight 20-by-4-metre arena, taking turns charging or tackling at full speed.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nMatches end in knockouts or are decided by dominance, with prize money reaching $NZ200,000 ($185,700) for the last man standing.\n\nDespite warnings from injury experts, the unregulated contest is booming online.\n\nBut sporting codes are pushing back. New Zealand Rugby has warned of \"significant risk of serious injury,\" with All Black and Moana Pasifika captain Ardie Savea saying sportspeople \"should not be seen supporting something like this.\"\n\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said people needed to take more responsibility for their actions, while in Australia, Manly Sea Eagles fans have been told they face bans if caught taking part in the craze at games, after footage surfaced showing men hurtling downhill into awaiting tacklers.\n\nCan you die from a head knock?\n\nDr Andrew Affleck, senior hospital scientist and brain bank manager at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, calls the craze a \"hit-fest\" designed to cause maximum damage.\n\nHe said repeated clashes, both mild and severe, increase the risk of developing neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia, motor neurone disease, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).\n\nQueensland league great Wally Lewis lives with probable CTE, while the late NRL coach Paul Green, who died by suicide in 2022, was posthumously diagnosed with CTE, a condition that cannot be fully diagnosed in living patients.\n\n\"They probably do not fully appreciate that each knock might be another step toward potential impairment,\" Dr Affleck said.\n\n\"We know that people who develop CTE have often experienced not just concussions but repeated blows, including non-concussive events.\n\n\" It is the day-to-day rumbling and tumbling of the brain inside the skull that over time leads to structural and functional damage. \"\n\nPolice described the incident that fatally injured Ryan Satterthwaite as \"innocuous,\" underscoring Dr Affleck's warning about the lethal risk of smaller impacts.\n\nRyan did not strike anything solid. According to police, it was the sheer force of the movement that led to his death.\n\nDr Affleck wants to see a shift in attitudes towards the trend.\n\n\"We only have one brain. It controls everything we do automatically, like breathing, movement, reflexes. Unlike other organs, we don't have a backup.\"\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\n'Bodies are disposable, pain is performative'\n\nAs thousands rallied around grassroots contests, mental health worker and advocate Shenei Penaia became concerned when a family member signed up to compete in Melbourne trials.\n\nMental health worker Shenei Penaia fears young boys are absorbing harmful ideas about masculinity. (Supplied: Shenei Penaia)\n\n\"My greatest worry is it reinforces a harmful form of masculinity. Young people are not just watching, they are learning that their bodies are disposable, pain is performative and safety comes second to going viral,\" she said.\n\n\"We should be building environments that protect and uplift our young people, our young men, where strength are things like self-awareness, vulnerability, and the freedom to say no to being put at risk.\n\n\" It goes beyond clout, cash, and clicks. It's about community, and if community is at its core, you'd think about this deeply. \"\n\nOn Wednesday, Run It Straight 24 CEO Christian 'Charizma' Lesa said the group will now enforce the use of mouthguards, headgear, and stricter tackling rules, with disqualification for any contact outside the chest-to-waist zone.\n\n\"We're still learning, but we want to make this as safe as possible so no head highs, no grass cuts, and if you're dazed, that's it, you're done,\" Lesa told Triple J Hack.\n\nLesa said paramedics and ambulances are on stand-by at events and he follows up with injured contestants.\n\nResponding to criticism after Ryan Satterthwaite's death, Lesa said Ryan's family were in his prayers \"but I can't be the one to blame if people are doing it outside [our competitions].\"\n\nThe ABC put separate questions to the RUNIT Championship League and Run It Straight 24 regarding safety measures, insurance, and competition rules but did not receive a response.",

I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a whole host of games played here, to be honest. Mayor Zoe Baker said: \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the most exceptionally pretty grounds, even though it needs an upgrade.\u201d Credit: Sam Mooy \u201cWe certainly haven\u2019t had those discussions. If they did, we would do what we can.\u201d Regardless of whether the ground hosts the spectacle of an NRL match, the council is acutely aware the existing facilities need extensive repairs and upgrades to cater for the male and female cricket, soccer, rugby and rugby league teams who regularly play at the oval \u2013 often to sell-out crowds.\n\nParsons said the change rooms were outdated, paint was peeling, brickwork was crumbling, and the shabby metal roofs on the old grandstands let in water, which has caused serious structural damage. The council had planned to complete $7.8 million of critical infrastructure renewal works on the oval in the 2026-27 financial year, followed by $12.7 million for similar repairs in 2027-28. There were also plans to install much-needed gender-neutral change rooms in the next couple of years. The hallowed oval is suffering from years of wear and tear. Credit: Sam Mooy Those projects got the chop when the council \u2013 which is struggling financially in part due to the ballooning $122 million cost of its disastrous Olympic pool rebuild \u2013 was knocked back for its bid to lift rates by 87 per cent over two years, an increase intended to add about $25 million to its coffers. \u201cWe could spend $12 million on it, and you wouldn\u2019t even know we\u2019d been here,\u201d Parsons said.\n\n\u201cEvery time I\u2019ve got $20 to put a coat of paint on something, we do it. But in a couple of years time we\u2019ll be in [run-down] Leichhardt Oval territory, we\u2019ll have to close stands and things like that. \u201d The ground still has a rare manual scoreboard. Credit: Sam Mooy Despite the oval\u2019s worn condition, Parsons said sporting clubs loved the ground for its history and nostalgia, due in large part to its picket fence, grandstands, manual scoreboard and the Moreton Bay fig. He said the council recently asked the clubs for their \u201cwarts and all feedback\u201d on the ground. Among their gripes were the oval\u2019s lacklustre food and beverage options \u2013 often a cold sausage roll and a warm beer \u2013 and the evident wear and tear. The clubs also expressed an appetite for technology upgrades, and bucket seats to replace the wooden benches to make ticket sales easier. \u201cThe positive side was everyone loves it \u2013 the players, officials, clubs, patrons \u2013 because it\u2019s this mini-Sydney Cricket Ground, the playing surface is second to none, and the atmosphere is great.\n\n\u201cWe cannot get any more content on that surface. We just need some capital investment.\u201d Parsons expected the council would apply for a rate rise next year. Meantime, staff would seek to boost revenue by hosting more events, and possibly using part of the complex for a community gym or a cafe featuring oval memorabilia. The council has already started to get food trucks in for match days. And it also raised the prospect of selling the sponsorship and naming rights for the ground. North Sydney Oval curator Shaun Eaton removes covers from the sports ground, which includes a rare drop-in cricket pitch.

        "text": "Thus, thanks to the Republicans\u2019 creative manipulation of the CBO\u2019s forecasting methodology, they (and the CBO) are significantly understating the real impact their \u201cbeautiful\u201d bill would have, if enacted in its current form, on US deficits and debt. The CBO analysis also doesn\u2019t yet account for the impact of the proposed spending and cost-cutting on the economy. That\u2019s an analysis that may come later, but the net effects would be to increase inflation and interest rates and add to the already threatening levels of deficits and debt. Republicans argue that the One Big Beautiful Bill will boost growth, although most independent analyses say that it will have minimal, if any, impact on US GDP over the decade. That is because the core of the bill, the $US3.8 trillion of tax cuts, are an extension of what\u2019s in place today, rather than a new and stimulatory cut to taxes. They also argue that Trump\u2019s tariffs will raise vast amounts of revenue, which they should, if not the $US2.8 trillion the CBO has projected.\n\nTrump and the Republicans don\u2019t, however, highlight the fact that the revenue will come largely from US consumers and will be economically damaging. Trump\u2019s tariffs are a massive new tax on consumption. Loading The CBO\u2019s assessment of the revenues that Trump\u2019s tariffs might raise does try to assess their economic effects, with the CBO saying they will reduce the size of the economy. It also says inflation will rise by an annual average of 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026 as a result of the tariffs and that, by 2035, the US economy would be 0.6 per cent smaller than it forecast in January this year. The problem with the CBO\u2019s analysis of the tariffs is that it has based it on where the tariffs are set today and therefore doesn\u2019t include whatever might happen when the 90-day pause on Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs ends next month. What that might look like is also dependent on the courts, with the administration appealing a decision by the US Court of International Trade that the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the baseline and reciprocal tariffs was illegal.\n\nThere are, however, other, albeit more time-consuming, avenues for Trump to impose those tariffs if that ruling is upheld by the appeals courts. The CBO assessment, for obvious reasons, also can\u2019t include the outcomes of the individual negotiations the administration has been having with dozens of countries over what the reciprocal tariff rates might be. Nor does it include the recent doubling of the rate on steel and aluminium imports. The extent to which countries that export to the US might retaliate is another unknown, as is the effectiveness of that retaliation in targeting sensitive elements of US supply chains and industrial sectors. Elon Musk has been a vocal critic of the bill, and he has some Republicans on his side. Credit: Getty Images There\u2019s no precedent for what Trump is doing on trade. Even without whatever the reciprocal tariffs might add, at their current levels the average US tariff would rise from less than 2.5 per cent to more than 15 per cent.\n\nIt should also be noted that the CBO assumes those tariffs in place today (subject to the outcomes in the courts) will remain in place for a decade. Given that only Trump and a handful of trade hawks in his administration think imposing tariffs on America\u2019s closest allies and trade partners is a good idea, that\u2019s a questionable assumption. If they do the level of damage that some analyses conclude they could \u2013 raising inflation and interest rates, slashing investment, generating shortages of critical goods, shrinking employment, causing a sharemarket sell-off \u2013 they might not even last this Trump term. If taken at face value, however, it would appear that Trump\u2019s tariffs more than offset Trump\u2019s tax cuts and other spending. Trump\u2019s tax cuts heavily favoured wealthy Americans. Low-income households got little from them. The tariffs, by adding to inflation and the cost of goods, will be regressive, given that low and middle income Americans spend a higher proportion of their income on goods.\n\nIf the tariffs were to raise $US2.8 trillion over the next decade, they would essentially be a $US2.8 trillion tax hike that would fall most heavily on low and middle-income households. It\u2019s an \u201cinteresting\u201d political strategy: proposing tax cuts for the rich but tax increases for the poor. There\u2019s no precedent for what Trump is doing on trade. The outcomes for both the One Big Beautiful Bill and the tariffs are still up in the air, with a small, but potentially decisive, group of fiscally conservative Senate Republicans holding out for bigger spending cuts, the fate of the tariffs overshadowed by the court proceedings and the \u201cnegotiations\u201d with America\u2019s trade partners on tariffs so far producing only one heads of agreement for relatively inconsequential changes to trade arrangements with the UK. Elon Musk, who is opposed to the tariffs, having just departed the White House and his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, has added to the sense of an administration struggling to maintain control of the budget debate.\n\nOn Wednesday, he urged his 220 million or so followers on his \u201cX\u201d social media platform to \u201cKILL\u201d the legislation by contacting their senators and congressional representatives. Loading Musk, who earlier this week described the bill as a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d \u2013 a \u201cmassive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill\u201d \u2013 posted that \u201cbankrupting America is NOT ok!\u201d There are enough Republicans who agree with Musk, unhappy with the prospect of a $S2.4 trillion addition to the existing $US21 trillion of cumulative deficits the CBO has forecast for the next decade, to force more substantial cost-cutting, if (and it\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d) they are prepared to defy Trump. Musk isn\u2019t the only influential figure in conservative circles in the US to view the prospect of yet another blow-out in US deficits and debt, at a point where Trump\u2019s trade policies have injected new dimensions of economic uncertainty and financial markets volatility, as a significant threat to America\u2019s economic stability.",

Alkot Studio, recently celebrated for its work on Pilloni in West End and Emme on James Street, is overseeing a space defined by green and white tiled walls, globe pendants and banquette seating. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019d fit on James Street. It makes sense here.\u201d Clarence co-owner Ben McShane The restaurant will carry over Clarence\u2019s distinctive green colour and also its open kitchen, this time with counter seating so you can get up close and personal with McShane and Kuhnemann as they go about their cooking. Clarence\u2019s approach to food will remain much the same, with McShane and Kuhnemann continuing to leverage close-knit relationships with producers such as Tommerup\u2019s Dairy Farm and Neighbourhood Farm to power a menu that constantly evolves depending on what\u2019s in season. \u201cBut then there will be a few more comfortable, accessible dishes that will stay on a little bit longer,\u201d McShane says. \u201cIt might be coral trout with new potatoes and a meuniere sauce, or something like a steak frites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarence will reopen on Fish Lane in mid-August. Markus Ravik \u201cIt\u2019s great to have those vibrant, interesting dishes [typical of Clarence], but there will just be a few more things \u2013 objectively good dishes that everyone\u2019s going to want to eat every day of the week.\u201d Drinks will continue to be anchored by a tight all-Australian wine list that favours \u201cfunky, smashable\u201d drops. \u201cThere\u2019s that population density here that means we can be that great neighbourhood restaurant,\u201d McShane says. \u201cWe can be part of your evening before the theatre, or after. We don\u2019t have that versatility where we are at the moment. So it\u2019s about adjusting what we\u2019re doing to suit that.\u201d Clarence will open at 51 Fish Lane in mid-August.\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

        "text": "Economic growth in some major economies has been forecast to slow down this week, while Australia's growth has been slower than predicted following extreme weather events but predicted to bounce back.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what's really going on and is Australia in a slightly better place?\n\n\n\n\n\nUS economic growth will slow to 1.6 per cent this year from 2.8 per cent last year as President Donald Trump's erratic trade wars disrupt global commerce, leaving businesses and consumers paralysed by uncertainty, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt projects Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow 1.8 per cent in 2025, which is above the OECD index's benchmark of 1.4 per cent, calculated from the 38-member countries.\n\n\n\nOther major economies like the UK, South Korea and Canada are forecast to grow only around 1 per cent, while Germany and Japan are experiencing even more sluggish times.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's GDP is then expected to rise 2.2 per cent in 2026, again higher than the average 1.5 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nChina \u2014 the world's second-biggest economy by total GDP per capita \u2014 is forecast to see growth decelerate from 5 per cent last year to 4.7 per cent in 2025 and 4.3 per cent in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 20 countries that share the euro currency will collectively see economic growth pick up from 0.8 per cent last year to 1 per cent in 2025 and 1.2 per cent next year, the OECD said, helped by interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Australia, other domestic economic growth figures, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday, paint a gloomy picture.\n\n\n\nGross domestic product slowed to 0.2 per cent in the first three months of 2025, down from a 0.6 per cent rise in the December quarter and weaker than economists had been expecting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was nothing to be happy about in the national accounts numbers today,\" said EY's chief economist Cherelle Murphy.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Treasurer Jim Chalmers said any growth was a decent outcome, given global uncertainty, a return to falling GDP per capita \u2014 a common measure of living standards \u2014 is worrying news for some analysts.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisruptions from Cyclone Alfred and flooding in Queensland and northern NSW cut $2.2 billion from the national economy, Treasury estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nMining, tourism and shipping were particularly impacted, but underlying growth remains soft, particularly household consumption.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Natural disasters cost Australian economy an estimated $2.2 billion in 2025\n\nThe economy had been boosted in recent years by stronger public spending, but as state government infrastructure projects come off and energy rebates unwind, Chalmers promised momentum would shift to the private sector.\n\n\n\n\n\nWestpac senior economist Pat Bustamante has been warning about the potential for a \"shaky handover\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In line with our updated expectations, public demand fell and the private sector struggled to pick up the slack,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteven Wu, a senior economist at the Commonwealth Bank, told SBS' On the Money podcast the GDP figures suggest \"a bit of a soft start to 2025\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We did see some strength in the back end of last year that looks to have dissipated over the first three months of 2025. That being said, I think there were some one-off or temporary factors at play,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\"We did see the economy affected by things like extreme weather events, natural disasters, that did play a role in weighing on overall growth outcomes. But still I think the trend is quite soft, although we do expect to see a bit of a rebound through the rest of this year.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWu said that despite Trump placing 10 per cent tariffs on Australia, there are some positive signs in the trade relationship for Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It was pretty interesting to note that we did see actually quite strong demand for our beef exports from the United States. So that tells us that there is still some sort of ongoing positives from our trading relationships as it kind of plays out over this year.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe noted consumers have been very cautious domestically, but in the second half of the year he expects a \"further increase in real household disposable income\".\n\n\n\nGlobal economic forecasts\n\nEconomic growth among G20 economies will slow to just 2.9 per cent this year and stay there in 2026, according to the OECD forecast. It marks a substantial deceleration from growth of 3.3 per cent global growth last year and 3.4 per cent in 2023.\n\n\n\nThe world economy has proven remarkably resilient in recent years, continuing to expand steadily in the face of global shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut global trade and the economic outlook have been clouded by Trump's sweeping taxes on imports, the unpredictable way he's rolled them out and the threat of retaliation from other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nReversing decades of US policy in favour of freer world trade, Trump has levied 10 per cent tariffs on imports from almost every country. He's also threatened more import taxes, including a doubling of his tariffs on steel and aluminium to 50 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout mentioning Trump by name, OECD chief economist \u00c1lvaro Pereira wrote in a commentary to accompany the forecast that \"we have seen a significant increase in trade barriers as well as in economic and trade policy uncertainty. This sharp rise in uncertainty has negatively impacted business and consumer confidence and is set to hold back trade and investment.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts .\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\nAustralia's economic growth slows down in the first quarter of this year\n\nGaza's aid centres temporarily close after a third deadly incident in as many days\n\nExcitement ahead of the Socceroos game against Japan\n\nAustralia's economic growth slowed to 0.2 per cent in the first three months of the year, as the nation's post-COVID recovery stalls.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter gross domestic product expanded 0.6 per cent in the December quarter, weaker-than-expected household consumption, business investment and public spending curtailed the economy's progress.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics says annual economic growth held steady at 1.3 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers says even modest economic growth is an encouraging outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our economy continues to grow despite very substantial global headwinds. We saw those set out by the OECD overnight and also in the commentary in the Reserve Bank minutes that were released yesterday. There wasn't a lot of growth in March but what growth,there was, was private sector led, and that's an encouraging sign.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe economy would need to grow by 0.7 per cent in the June quarter to meet the Reserve Bank's forecast of 1.8 per cent annual growth by the middle of this year - an outcome below that would increase the chance of further interest rate cuts.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nTasmanian Premier Jeremy Rockliff has defended his reputation, as a no-confidence motion is debated in the state's parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor leader Dean Winter has secured the support of three independents to bring the motion against Mr Rockliff over the Premier's financial management and recent cost blowouts for a new AFL stadium in Hobart.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Rockliff has vowed that once the motion is passed, he will seek a fresh election, less than 15 months after the last vote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It has been a challenge governing: the pandemic, the challenge of losing six beautiful children, the commission of inquiry. All those areas where leaders have had to step up. And I remember all those things well. Difficult decisions had to be made. We had to open up the heart and the cheque book.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLosing a no-confidence motion normally requires the government to resign in favour of an alternative government or to advise a dissolution of the lower house.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US-backed organisation in charge of Israel's new aid distribution system in Gaza says it has suspended aid distribution for the day.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes after dozens of Palestinians were killed while seeking aid in the third deadly incident in as many days.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gaza Humanitarian Foundation says it will not distribute any more food; and is urging the Israeli military to improve civilian safety around distribution sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are now only four aid sites in Gaza, after Israel implemented a new aid model, displacing the UN system that involved 400 sites.\n\n\n\n\n\nU-N spokesman Stephane Dujarric says the system is a recipe for disaster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The system, as (UN official) Philipe Lazzarini called it, is a death trap, right? This system of funneling people between barbed wires, forcing them to walk to get the food, with armed contractors who come from who knows where, with what kind of accountability, right? They're not even, they're not, they're not accountable to national authorities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael says its forces did fire what it calls warning shots at people it views as a threat.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nIn football, Perth-raised Serie A centre-back Alessandro Circati says he is excited to play for the Socceroos when the team goes up against Japan in the World Cup qualifier.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 50,000 spectators are expected to watch the game tomorrow in Perth.\n\n\n\n\n\nA win would put the team on the brink of qualification for the 2026 World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nCircati tore his ACL in September last year, but has made a successful return to club football, playing full games in Parma\u2019s final two matches of the Italian Serie A season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 21-year-old says he is feeling good about returning to the Socceroos squad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Obviously for confidence it is great and then for yourself because after an injury like this, you never know how you return. It is a bit of an unknown. I think I returned really well. Stronger than I was before. I think over that time, I really worked on myself as a person and as an athlete. I worked on areas where maybe I was weaker - or areas that I had to improve. And so I feel like I have returned back as a better athlete.\"\n\n\n\n",

So while I\u2019m pleased with the result, the fact that the margin wasn\u2019t overwhelmingly large also reminds me that we still face many challenges ahead. It\u2019s a day that brings both joy, but at the same time it is a day that calls for renewed determination.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nMillions of Australian workers will receive one of their largest real pay rises in years, after the Fair Work Commission's minimum wage decision.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe country\u2019s lowest paid will receive an extra $32 a week due to decision, which delivers an above inflation increase of 3.5 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is in line with the federal government's call for a sustainable pay rise.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, says the decision is a great outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Finally, award wage workers in Australia, our lowest paid workers, are getting ahead again and that's great news. The Fair Work Commission accepted the arguments made by unions that it was time for low wage workers, award workers, to start catching up for what was lost during the inflation spike.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal Multicultural Minister, Anne Aly, will lead the newly created Office of Multicultural Affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will operate within the Home Affairs Department - and will combine the department's existing multicultural affairs agenda, with settlement services and community grants programs.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Aly told SBS, the new office will be able to work more closely on issues that are important to multicultural Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To be quite honest with you for too long, multiculturalism has been about citizenship and Immigration. Carving it out from Citizenship and Immigration, whilst recognizing that there are some crossovers there, gives Multicultural Affairs portfolio a standalone remit.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe department will undergo a consultation period, which will inform which tasks will be taken on by the new office.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnne Aly became the first female Muslim cabinet minister, when she was promoted in the reshuffle last month.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nAboriginal children who were forcibly removed from their families under government policies from the early 1900s until the 1970s in Western Australia have welcomed the announcement of a state redress scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving survivors of what's called the Stolen Generations will be eligible for $85,000, with the distribution of payments to begin later this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes 28 years after a landmark document, called the Bringing Them Home report, called for such a measure.\n\n\n\n\n\nStolen Generations survivor Tony Hansen has told SBS that after years of campaigning, it's an important milestone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We can work together, we can identify those people that have these urgent needs to have this assessment done, and we'll work with the government to ensure that the people have their reparations attended to and addressed as soon as possible. But also the Premier made it very clear that even if people are to pass away, this redress will be alive and active, and it will be handed down to their descendants.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "He thought the old-school oval \u201cmight struggle a little bit to be an NRL venue, to be honest\u201d. \u201cWe might get one game, and I think that might be a bit more of a nostalgic thing rather than anything else. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a whole host of games played here, to be honest. Mayor Zoe Baker said: \u201cI think it\u2019s one of the most exceptionally pretty grounds, even though it needs an upgrade.\u201d Credit: Sam Mooy \u201cWe certainly haven\u2019t had those discussions. If they did, we would do what we can.\u201d Regardless of whether the ground hosts the spectacle of an NRL match, the council is acutely aware the existing facilities need extensive repairs and upgrades to cater for the male and female cricket, soccer, rugby and rugby league teams who regularly play at the oval \u2013 often to sell-out crowds.\n\nParsons said the change rooms were outdated, paint was peeling, brickwork was crumbling, and the shabby metal roofs on the old grandstands let in water, which has caused serious structural damage. The council had planned to complete $7.8 million of critical infrastructure renewal works on the oval in the 2026-27 financial year, followed by $12.7 million for similar repairs in 2027-28. There were also plans to install much-needed gender-neutral change rooms in the next couple of years. The hallowed oval is suffering from years of wear and tear. Credit: Sam Mooy Those projects got the chop when the council \u2013 which is struggling financially in part due to the ballooning $122 million cost of its disastrous Olympic pool rebuild \u2013 was knocked back for its bid to lift rates by 87 per cent over two years, an increase intended to add about $25 million to its coffers. \u201cWe could spend $12 million on it, and you wouldn\u2019t even know we\u2019d been here,\u201d Parsons said.\n\n\u201cEvery time I\u2019ve got $20 to put a coat of paint on something, we do it. But in a couple of years time we\u2019ll be in [run-down] Leichhardt Oval territory, we\u2019ll have to close stands and things like that. \u201d The ground still has a rare manual scoreboard. Credit: Sam Mooy Despite the oval\u2019s worn condition, Parsons said sporting clubs loved the ground for its history and nostalgia, due in large part to its picket fence, grandstands, manual scoreboard and the Moreton Bay fig. He said the council recently asked the clubs for their \u201cwarts and all feedback\u201d on the ground. Among their gripes were the oval\u2019s lacklustre food and beverage options \u2013 often a cold sausage roll and a warm beer \u2013 and the evident wear and tear. The clubs also expressed an appetite for technology upgrades, and bucket seats to replace the wooden benches to make ticket sales easier. \u201cThe positive side was everyone loves it \u2013 the players, officials, clubs, patrons \u2013 because it\u2019s this mini-Sydney Cricket Ground, the playing surface is second to none, and the atmosphere is great.\n\n\u201cWe cannot get any more content on that surface. We just need some capital investment.\u201d Parsons expected the council would apply for a rate rise next year. Meantime, staff would seek to boost revenue by hosting more events, and possibly using part of the complex for a community gym or a cafe featuring oval memorabilia. The council has already started to get food trucks in for match days. And it also raised the prospect of selling the sponsorship and naming rights for the ground. North Sydney Oval curator Shaun Eaton removes covers from the sports ground, which includes a rare drop-in cricket pitch. Credit: Sam Mooy \u201cWe\u2019ll work hard on our business plan and squirrel away our pennies and do things when we can.\u201d Baker said the council was eager to work with sporting codes on a masterplan for the facility.",

        "text": "Thus, thanks to the Republicans\u2019 creative manipulation of the CBO\u2019s forecasting methodology, they (and the CBO) are significantly understating the real impact their \u201cbeautiful\u201d bill would have, if enacted in its current form, on US deficits and debt. The CBO analysis also doesn\u2019t yet account for the impact of the proposed spending and cost-cutting on the economy. That\u2019s an analysis that may come later, but the net effects would be to increase inflation and interest rates and add to the already threatening levels of deficits and debt. Republicans argue that the One Big Beautiful Bill will boost growth, although most independent analyses say that it will have minimal, if any, impact on US GDP over the decade. That is because the core of the bill, the $US3.8 trillion of tax cuts, are an extension of what\u2019s in place today, rather than a new and stimulatory cut to taxes. They also argue that Trump\u2019s tariffs will raise vast amounts of revenue, which they should, if not the $US2.8 trillion the CBO has projected.\n\nTrump and the Republicans don\u2019t, however, highlight the fact that the revenue will come largely from US consumers and will be economically damaging. Trump\u2019s tariffs are a massive new tax on consumption. Loading The CBO\u2019s assessment of the revenues that Trump\u2019s tariffs might raise does try to assess their economic effects, with the CBO saying they will reduce the size of the economy. It also says inflation will rise by an annual average of 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026 as a result of the tariffs and that, by 2035, the US economy would be 0.6 per cent smaller than it forecast in January this year. The problem with the CBO\u2019s analysis of the tariffs is that it has based it on where the tariffs are set today and therefore doesn\u2019t include whatever might happen when the 90-day pause on Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs ends next month. What that might look like is also dependent on the courts, with the administration appealing a decision by the US Court of International Trade that the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the baseline and reciprocal tariffs was illegal.\n\nThere are, however, other, albeit more time-consuming, avenues for Trump to impose those tariffs if that ruling is upheld by the appeals courts. The CBO assessment, for obvious reasons, also can\u2019t include the outcomes of the individual negotiations the administration has been having with dozens of countries over what the reciprocal tariff rates might be. Nor does it include the recent doubling of the rate on steel and aluminium imports. The extent to which countries that export to the US might retaliate is another unknown, as is the effectiveness of that retaliation in targeting sensitive elements of US supply chains and industrial sectors. Elon Musk has been a vocal critic of the bill, and he has some Republicans on his side. Credit: Getty Images There\u2019s no precedent for what Trump is doing on trade. Even without whatever the reciprocal tariffs might add, at their current levels the average US tariff would rise from less than 2.5 per cent to more than 15 per cent.\n\nIt should also be noted that the CBO assumes those tariffs in place today (subject to the outcomes in the courts) will remain in place for a decade. Given that only Trump and a handful of trade hawks in his administration think imposing tariffs on America\u2019s closest allies and trade partners is a good idea, that\u2019s a questionable assumption. If they do the level of damage that some analyses conclude they could \u2013 raising inflation and interest rates, slashing investment, generating shortages of critical goods, shrinking employment, causing a sharemarket sell-off \u2013 they might not even last this Trump term. If taken at face value, however, it would appear that Trump\u2019s tariffs more than offset Trump\u2019s tax cuts and other spending. Trump\u2019s tax cuts heavily favoured wealthy Americans. Low-income households got little from them. The tariffs, by adding to inflation and the cost of goods, will be regressive, given that low and middle income Americans spend a higher proportion of their income on goods.\n\nIf the tariffs were to raise $US2.8 trillion over the next decade, they would essentially be a $US2.8 trillion tax hike that would fall most heavily on low and middle-income households. It\u2019s an \u201cinteresting\u201d political strategy: proposing tax cuts for the rich but tax increases for the poor. There\u2019s no precedent for what Trump is doing on trade. The outcomes for both the One Big Beautiful Bill and the tariffs are still up in the air, with a small, but potentially decisive, group of fiscally conservative Senate Republicans holding out for bigger spending cuts, the fate of the tariffs overshadowed by the court proceedings and the \u201cnegotiations\u201d with America\u2019s trade partners on tariffs so far producing only one heads of agreement for relatively inconsequential changes to trade arrangements with the UK. Elon Musk, who is opposed to the tariffs, having just departed the White House and his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, has added to the sense of an administration struggling to maintain control of the budget debate.\n\nOn Wednesday, he urged his 220 million or so followers on his \u201cX\u201d social media platform to \u201cKILL\u201d the legislation by contacting their senators and congressional representatives. Loading Musk, who earlier this week described the bill as a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d \u2013 a \u201cmassive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill\u201d \u2013 posted that \u201cbankrupting America is NOT ok!\u201d There are enough Republicans who agree with Musk, unhappy with the prospect of a $S2.4 trillion addition to the existing $US21 trillion of cumulative deficits the CBO has forecast for the next decade, to force more substantial cost-cutting, if (and it\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d) they are prepared to defy Trump. Musk isn\u2019t the only influential figure in conservative circles in the US to view the prospect of yet another blow-out in US deficits and debt, at a point where Trump\u2019s trade policies have injected new dimensions of economic uncertainty and financial markets volatility, as a significant threat to America\u2019s economic stability.",

Clarence owners Ben McShane and Matt Kuhnemann. Markus Ravik But in a 40-seat heritage tenancy in the old Shop Row building, there\u2019s an argument it\u2019s a touch too little and, given its quality, should be better known. Also, its location, at the Annerley Road end of Stanley Street, can be hard to travel to. But a move to Fish Lane in 10 weeks is intended to change that.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article One of the Valley\u2019s best bars welcomes heritage-listed sister venue Clarence will close on Stanley Street in late July and reopen in a new tenancy tucked underneath the Cremorne apartment development. \u201cI think we were looking for what the next thing would be,\u201d McShane says. \u201cBut it\u2019s obviously a huge commitment, something like that. So we were a little apprehensive. \u201cThe last few years haven\u2019t gone quite as well as we\u2019d hoped, so it can be hard to double down on [the concept].\u201d Fish Lane, though, is very different to Stanley Street. Over the past decade it\u2019s become one of the city\u2019s best dining precincts, second perhaps only to James Street. Southside, Julius, Maeve Wine, Hello Please and Lune all call the area home, among a bunch of others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new restaurant will seat 20 more people than its current Stanley Street premises. Markus Ravik It\u2019s surrounded by stacks of residential apartments, has ready access to public transport, is just across the road from QAGOMA and the Queensland Museum, and QPAC is scheduled to unveil its new 1500-seat theatre towards the end of the year. \u201cThere\u2019s everything here,\u201d McShane says. \u201cThere\u2019s residential. It\u2019s a little bit more eclectic than, say, James Street. It\u2019s a little more relaxed \u2026 but you\u2019re still very well-connected to everything. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019d fit on James Street. It makes sense here.\u201d You can understand how the building\u2019s landlord, Stockwell, got McShane and Kuhnemann over the line.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarence 2.0 will be a precisely designed open-air 60-seat evolution on its predecessor. Alkot Studio, recently celebrated for its work on Pilloni in West End and Emme on James Street, is overseeing a space defined by green and white tiled walls, globe pendants and banquette seating. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019d fit on James Street. It makes sense here.\u201d Clarence co-owner Ben McShane The restaurant will carry over Clarence\u2019s distinctive green colour and also its open kitchen, this time with counter seating so you can get up close and personal with McShane and Kuhnemann as they go about their cooking. Clarence\u2019s approach to food will remain much the same, with McShane and Kuhnemann continuing to leverage close-knit relationships with producers such as Tommerup\u2019s Dairy Farm and Neighbourhood Farm to power a menu that constantly evolves depending on what\u2019s in season. \u201cBut then there will be a few more comfortable, accessible dishes that will stay on a little bit longer,\u201d McShane says. \u201cIt might be coral trout with new potatoes and a meuniere sauce, or something like a steak frites.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClarence will reopen on Fish Lane in mid-August. Markus Ravik \u201cIt\u2019s great to have those vibrant, interesting dishes [typical of Clarence], but there will just be a few more things \u2013 objectively good dishes that everyone\u2019s going to want to eat every day of the week.\u201d Drinks will continue to be anchored by a tight all-Australian wine list that favours \u201cfunky, smashable\u201d drops. \u201cThere\u2019s that population density here that means we can be that great neighbourhood restaurant,\u201d McShane says. \u201cWe can be part of your evening before the theatre, or after. We don\u2019t have that versatility where we are at the moment. So it\u2019s about adjusting what we\u2019re doing to suit that.\u201d Clarence will open at 51 Fish Lane in mid-August.\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

The other options the NRL are considering include former Australian captain Cameron Smith and ex-Broncos coach Kevin Walters.",
