China won't kneel down.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump, left, and Chinese President Xi Jinping are in the midst of a bitter trade war. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File) (AP)\n\nThe video narrates a history lesson of what China considers American economic aggression, forcing companies such as Toshiba and Alstom into breakup, financial crisis and bankruptcy and sending Japan's economy into \"decades of anemic growth.\"\n\nBy contrast, China portrayed itself as a free-trade haven with which other countries can safety invest and partner.\n\n\"China will stand firm, no matter how hard the wind blows,\" China said in the video. \"Someone has to step forward, torch in hand to shatter the fog and illuminate the path ahead.\"\n\nThe sweeping and dramatic rhetoric doubled as a stern message to the Trump administration after its historic trade war escalation as well as a call to action for other countries. China in the video called on every nation to \"stand tall\" to \"break through the walls of hegemony.\"\n\nThe video didn't specifically mention the 145 per cent tariffs the Trump administration has imposed on Chinese imports \u2013 or the 125 per cent retaliatory tariffs China has, in turn, placed on American goods. But China published the video across social media in a moment of apparent willingness to bend from the Trump administration.\n\nChina insists it will stand up to the US tariffs, and urged other nations to take a similar stand. (Getty)\n\nTrump has recently said he expects the tariff on Chinese goods to come down, and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently called the extremely high tariffs \"unsustainable.\"\n\nBut Trump also said China would need to come up with a strong offer, and though he has said the two nations are in constant communication, China has repeatedly denied the countries are in any kind of active trade negotiation.\n\nMeanwhile, trade talks with the US appear to be in full swing for a large handful of other nations. Bessent said he is in active discussions with 17 other countries during a 90-day window in which the Trump administration paused extraordinarily high \"reciprocal tariffs\" as high as 50 per cent on dozens of countries.\n\nChina urged other nations to stand firm \u2013 and to not pick sides with the US over China.\n\n\"We know standing up for ourselves keeps the possibility of cooperation alive,\" the video said. \"China won't back down so the voices of the weak will be heard, bullying will be stopped and justice will not disappear from the world.\"\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) (AP)\n\nThe video's message: America is untrustworthy.\n\nIn the video, China called the US \"a paper tiger.\" It noted that American imports and exports make up less than a fifth of global trade, and the nation \"does not represent the entire world.\"",

Trump later said it was a \"good call\".\n\n\"Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,\" Trump told reporters on Tuesday. \"He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, back left, shows a picture of Jeff Bezos as she responds to a question about Amazon. (AP)\n\nPunchbowl News first reported that Amazon will soon \"display how much of an item's cost is derived from tariffs \u2014 right next to the product's total listed price.\"\n\nThe move could directly illustrate to American consumers how Trump's tariffs are affecting the cost of goods. Trump has slapped 145 per cent tariffs on imports from China and a 10 per cent minimum tax on all other countries.\n\nThe call came shortly after one of the senior officials phoned the president to inform him of the story.\n\n\"Of course he was pissed,\" one of the officials, granted anonymity to speak candidly, told CNN.\n\n\"Why should a multibillion-dollar company pass off costs to consumers?\"\n\nAt a briefing Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the move a \"hostile and political act,\" adding that she had spoken about the matter with President Trump earlier.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Levitt's comments, saying it was a hostile act if a company went out of its way to \"make it seem\" like tariffs have caused prices to change.\n\nAmazon boss Jeff Bezos alongside his fiancee Lauren Sanchez at a red carpet earlier this month. (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)\n\n\"It's nonsense,\" he said in a CNBC interview. \"A 10 per cent tariff is not going to change virtually any price,\" he added, referring to the nearly universal baseline tariff on all countries.\n\n\"The only price will change would be a product that we don't make here, like a mango.\" The 10 per cent tariff, however, is hardly the only one in effect.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said in a statement to CNN that the move \"was never a consideration for the main Amazon site and nothing has been implemented on any Amazon properties.\"\n\nAmazon, however, said it was considering the \"idea of listing import charges on certain products\" on Haul, its spin-off website that sells items below $US20 ($31), but the change wasn't rolled out.\n\n\"This was never approved and not going to happen,\" an Amazon spokesperson said.\n\nHowever, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer encouraged businesses to do just that.\n\n\"To the large businesses that sell to consumers, I say show your customers how much tariffs are hurting in their pocketbook. People deserve to know the impact tariffs have on their finances,\" Schumer said in remarks delivered on the Senate floor.\n\nChinese online retailers Temu and Shein have already sounded the alarm over increased prices. (AP)\n\nOther e-commerce websites, such as Shein and Temu, have implemented changes to their pricing due to the cost of tariffs. Temu has even introduced a new import charge that is displayed at checkout. Both companies source most of their products from China.\n\nLeavitt also cited a Reuters report from 2021 about an alleged partnership between Amazon and a \"Chinese propaganda arm\" that censored user reviews on its Chinese website for President Xi Jinping's speeches and writings.\n\nShe said that was \"another reason why Americans should buy American,\" adding that \"it's another reason why we are onshoring critical supply chains here at home, to shore up our own critical supply chain and boost our own manufacturing here.\"\n\nBezos has actively worked to cultivate a relationship with the president in his second term, congratulating him on his November election and dining at the White House.\n\nAmazon donated $US1 million to Trump's inaugural fund and is producing a documentary focused on first lady Melania Trump .\n\nTrump recently praised Bezos, telling The Atlantic in an interview published Monday: \"He's 100 per cent. He's been great.\"",

Les Kiss will be the next Wallabies coach, but not until next year after Joe Schmidt agreed to extend his tenure.\n\nIn 1985, North Sydney Bears coach Brian \"Chicka\" Norton travelled to Brisbane on a recruitment drive during the off-season.\n\nNorton's main target was Gary Belcher, who had recently played fullback in Souths' premiership-winning team in the Brisbane Rugby League competition.\n\nThe Bears couldn't afford the asking price for Belcher, however, and he would eventually sign with the Canberra Raiders and become one of their greats.\n\nNorton, though, took note of recommendations given to him about Kiss, who was making an impression as a winger with the storied Valley Diehards club.\n\n\"Les Kiss is the man we want,\" Norton told Bears officials, who signed the Bundaberg product for the following season.\n\nIt proved to be a wise decision, with Kiss excelling to such an extent he made his Test and State of Origin debut during his first year with the Bears.\n\nFast-forward to 2025, and Kiss became the man Rugby Australia (RA) wanted to replace Joe Schmidt as Wallabies coach.\n\nJoe Schmidt (left) joined the Wallabies program in 2024. (Getty Images: Clive Rose)\n\nInitially, RA hoped for a post-Rugby Championship transition in October following Schmidt's decision to stand down for family reasons.\n\nBut after a drawn-out process, Schmidt agreed to stay on until mid-2026, from which point Kiss will be handed the reins once his three-year contract as Queensland Reds coach expires.\n\nKiss's 25-year rugby journey\n\nSnobs in the Australian rugby union community may be incredulous a former league player has been handed such a prestigious position.\n\nBut Kiss is no newcomer to the \"game they play in heaven\".\n\nHe has cut his teeth across several countries during a 25-year span in rugby union, working in both national and club programs.\n\n\"It's a long process,\" said Kiss, as he discussed his transition between the rugby codes at an RA media conference in Sydney on Wednesday.\n\n\"Coming from the 80s \u2026 changing into rugby, I think you learn a lot of things along the way but one thing that is absolutely important is you don't get anywhere on your own.\n\n\"Places that build strong people around you, that have a team focus, those are the teams that win premierships.\n\n\"Those are the teams that grow and continue to meet the challenges on any level.\"\n\nAfter holding down coaching positions in rugby league, Kiss switched codes to become a defence consultant in South Africa across 2001 and 2002.\n\nKiss's influence was evident at the Test level when the Springboks conceded just three tries during the 2001 Tri-Nations tournament.\n\nKiss (right) worked with the Waratahs early in his coaching career. (Getty Images: Mark Nolan)\n\nAssistant coach roles with the Waratahs \u2014 working under Bob Dwyer and Ewen McKenzie \u2014 and the Australia A team further consolidated Kiss's reputation as a defensive specialist.\n\nHe was recruited by Ireland head coach Declan Kidney ahead of the 2009 Six Nations, enjoying immediate success when the Irish claimed their first Grand Slam in 61 years.\n\nDuring Kidney's reign, Kiss was credited with introducing the \"choke tackle\", which was used to great effect when Ireland upset the Wallabies 15\u20146 at Auckland's Eden Park during the pool stage at the 2011 World Cup.\n\nWill Genia was a particular target, and he fell victim to the defensive ploy when Ireland back-rower Stephen Ferris famously wrapped up the Wallabies scrum half and drove him back more than 10 metres.\n\n\"We've focused on closing down the options Genia has,\" Kiss said before the match, giving a glimpse of his thoroughness as a coach.\n\n\"We've got to concentrate on picking the right moment to put pressure on him.\"\n\nKiss (left) was as an assistant coach under Schmidt with Ireland between 2013 and 2015. (Getty Images/Sportsfile: Seb Daly)\n\nKiss later served as Ireland's interim head coach for two Tests, following Kidney's sacking in 2013, before joining Schmidt's staff when the New Zealander was appointed to the permanent role.\n\nIreland won consecutive Six Nations crowns with Kiss working alongside Schmidt, but exited the 2015 Rugby World Cup earlier than expected in the quarterfinal stage.\n\nAfter the Rugby World Cup, Kiss joined Irish powerhouse Ulster on a full-time basis as its director of rugby, but his tenure produced inconsistent results and he departed in January 2018.\n\nKiss was named London Irish head coach two months later and while he could not avoid relegation from England's top-flight premiership, the club did win the second-tier competition the following the season to earn promotion.\n\nLondon Irish punched above its weight to finish fifth in the 2022/23 premiership before financial difficulties led to the club's demise, leading Kiss back to his home state of Queensland ahead of the 2024 Super Rugby Pacific season.\n\nDoubts over Kiss's credentials\n\nWhile Kiss's CV is bursting with international experience, there will be critics pointing to the fact he has not won a title in a top-tier domestic tournament.\n\nEddie Jones (Brumbies, 2001), Ewen McKenzie (Reds, 2011) and Michael Cheika (Waratahs, 2014) all won Super Rugby championships in the professional era prior to coaching the Wallabies.\n\nAnd Rugby World Cup-winning coaches Bob Dwyer and Rod Macqueen enjoyed great success at club and provincial level respectively before leading the national side.\n\nIn February, following Schmidt's announcement he would not lead the Wallabies through to the 2027 Rugby World Cup, Australian coaching doyen John Connolly suggested RA again look offshore to find a replacement.\n\nConnolly, who oversaw the Wallabies in 2006 and 2007, told News Corp none of the four Australian Super Rugby Pacific coaches had \"stand-out resumes\".\n\nIt contrasted with the situation in New Zealand rugby when they were choosing a successor to All Blacks coach Ian Foster after it was decided he would finish up at the 2023 Rugby World Cup.\n\nScott Robertson had won multiple Super Rugby titles with the Crusaders before being picked ahead of Jamie Joseph, who claimed silverware with the Highlanders and guided Japan to a historic Rugby World Cup quarterfinal appearance in 2019.\n\nKiss has coached the Queensland Reds the past two seasons. (Getty Images: Kai Schwoerer)\n\nIn Kiss's defence, he has time to win over sceptics.\n\nThe Reds are in finals contention in this year's Super Rugby Pacific competition, sitting in fourth place on the standings after 11 rounds.\n\nHe will have another bite of the cherry when he sees out the third season of his Reds' contract next year before linking up with the Wallabies.\n\nIn his favour as a coach, Kiss has the unwavering support of his players.\n\nThis is illustrated by several Reds stars \u2014 including Wallabies captain Harry Wilson and Fraser McReight \u2014 signing long-term contract extensions to stay at Ballymore.\n\nKiss can be described as a \"player's coach\" and this trait wouldn't have gone unnoticed when RA came chasing his services.\n\nEven though RA had hoped Schmidt would take the Wallabies through to the next Rugby World Cup, the fact the governing body agreed to Kiss seeing out his Reds deal indicates how keen they were to have the 60-year-old on board.\n\nJust like the North Sydney Bears back in the 80s, RA got the man they wanted.",

        "text": "The company behind a controversial New South Wales Upper Hunter coal project has told the ABC it will walk away from the site almost 30 years after first looking to mine in the region.\n\nThe Bickham Coal proposal divided the small communities of Scone, Blandford, and Murrurundi during the early 2000s in a dispute dubbed \"coal versus foals\".\n\nThe decades-long fight saw the mining sector champion the Bickham Coal project and its potential economic boost, while the thoroughbred sector said its multi-billion-dollar industry would be at risk.\n\nIn 2010 the project became the first greenfield mine to be knocked back by the NSW government, but up until now the company has renewed and retained its licence.\n\nThe exploration licence to extract coal up to 900 metres underground for 25 years expires in a matter of weeks \u2014 28 years after being granted.\n\nThe ABC can now reveal there will be no mining of any kind at the site near Murrurundi, with Bickham pulling the plug for good.\n\nBickham Coal did not agree to an interview with the ABC and instead issued a statement on its last remaining licence.\n\n\"Bickham Coal Company held two exploration licences, one granted in 1997, the other 2001,\" the statement said.\n\nThe company said one was cancelled last year and it \"intends for the remaining one to be cancelled in the near future\".\n\nAround 20 years ago Bickham Coal extracted a 25,000-tonne bulk sample of coal to determine the viability of mining in the area. (ABC Rural: David Claughton)\n\n\"Although this licence expires on 28 May 2025, Bickham will seek to have it renewed only for the purpose of having rehabilitation works completed and approved by the department,\" it said.\n\nThat is a mandatory condition before a licence cancellation.\n\nThe statement said, \"Bickham intends for this to happen in the quickest possible time frame\".\n\n\"Bickham has no intention of pursuing mining activity at the site,\" it said.\n\nCoal vs foals\n\nThe Hunter's world-renowned thoroughbred breeding industry led the campaign against the mine. (ABC News: Bridget Murphy)\n\nThe long-running interest in the Bickham project began in 1997 when the first exploration licence was granted.\n\nConsultation and talks about the proposal began in earnest five years later.\n\nBickham Coal said at the time that its 36-million-tonne project could have created almost 400 jobs and delivered $3.7 billion in revenue.\n\nThe then-mayor of the now-defunct Murrurundi Shire Council, Earl Kelaher, said it was an optimistic time.\n\n\"The owner of Bickham Coal made it very easy to talk to him,\" he said.\n\n\" I think what he offered Murrurundi was very encouraging at the time with the offer of new homes, and his workers living in those homes, instead of driving out of town to do their work. \"\n\nBut not everyone was on side.\n\nPeter Haydon said the fight against the mine took a toll. (ABC News: Tim Lee)\n\nBlandford farmer and horse breeder Peter Haydon said he spent years fighting the mine project.\n\n\"It was certainly a 10-year fight. It's culminated in a fantastic result because it actually affects all the studs that the Pages River flows through,\" he said.\n\nRetail King Gerry Harvey, who has interests in the thoroughbred breeding sector, weighed into the fight against Bickham, as did retired talkback radio host Alan Jones.\n\nWhen it came to assessing the mine in 2010 then-premier Kristina Keneally sided with the horse industry, travelling to the region to announce the Bickham application had been rejected.\n\n\"We recognise the importance of the thoroughbred industry and the significant impacts this proposal will have on groundwater,\" Ms Keneally said at the time.\n\nIt is believed to have been the first time the NSW government had rejected a greenfield mining proposal.\n\nFormer premier Kristina Keneally rejected an open cut coal mine at the Bickham site. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nMr Haydon was thrilled.\n\n\"It was a real credit to our community how they all pulled together and came up with this amazing result,\" he said.\n\nFinal reflections\n\nBut Mr Kelaher said it was a lost opportunity for Murrurundi and surrounds.\n\n\"We did talk about the void that the mine would eventually make that could have been made into storage, water storage for Murrurundi township,\" he said.\n\n\"That made us think very clearly about what we were dealing with because we've battled for water for years and years.\"\n\nIn the end, foal won over coal.\n\nFifteen years on, as the chapter finally closes, Peter Haydon said \"the district can celebrate in a big way\".",

        "text": "Jesse Southwell is too young to be making a comeback but when supreme talent and State of Origin are concerned, time has a funny way of turning.\n\nIt's not her return that's a great shock. The Blues lost the series last year and changing up the halves following an agonising Origin defeat is as much a part of New South Wales as not being able to afford real estate in Sydney.\n\nWith a new coach in John Strange, the Blues need a new approach. That can start with Southwell, who was overlooked for Rachael Pearson and Corban Baxter last year after making her Origin debut in 2023.\n\nShe has looked like the future of the sport ever since she steered the Knights to their first NRLW premiership as a 17-year-old crackerjack playmaker with no fear, all the skills and the kind of technical acumen that can only come from playing rugby league your whole life.\n\nIt gives her a prodigious command of her own abilities, a style that seems naturally assured and a seemingly limitless scope for what she can achieve in rugby league.\n\nSouthwell seemed like the future of the sport from the moment she debuted in the NRLW. (AAP: Lukas Coch)\n\nTurning around the Blues' fortunes might seem like a lot to ask of Southwell, who is still just 20 years old and whose best football, even after all she's already accomplished, may still be years away. Halfback play is more of an art than a science and a long career has peaks and valleys like a mountain range.\n\nBut she is the kind of player for whom great expectations are made, to the point that every success seems ordained, like it was always supposed to happen, and every failure is just a minor setback in a career whose trajectory seems as certain and true as anything in football can be.\n\nIt's a lot to carry and heaping the weight of the world on prodigies has been the undoing of many a young star. But when a halfback has two NRLW premierships to their name while they're still a teenager, nothing else seems to really fit.\n\nSo it makes all the sense in the world that Southwell is back here, that her clash with Ali Brigginshaw shapes as a moment where the past and the future collide in the present, as the Novocastrian tries to do what no other Blues halfback has done and deliver New South Wales their first-ever Origin series win in a multi-game format.\n\nThis is meant to be her time and, if the side named by Strange is anything to go by, it will also be her team.\n\nBlues five-eighth Tiana Penitani has experienced a career renaissance in recent years at centre, but her experience in the halves is limited to one Test for the Jillaroos where she was a late replacement and one game for Tonga.\n\nHow Brown's fire and ice create Origin field goal magic Photo shows Lauren Brown prepares to kick Queensland field-goal queen Lauren Brown, a firefighter by day and night, explains what pressure is and why she thrives in do-or-die State of Origin moments.\n\nHer move into the halves is a curious one as the Blues are hardly bereft of options.\n\nKirra Dibb, who partnered Southwell in the halves during that first Knights title and has blossomed as a playmaker since joining North Queensland, has not made the match-day 18, and Baxter and Pearson were overlooked from the squad entirely.\n\nEmma Verran nee Tonegato is in the side and has plenty of halves experience. However, barring a last-minute reshuffle, she'll come off the bench.\n\nDebutant fullback Abbi Church is better known as a runner than a creator. She did not accumulate a single try assist in last year's NRLW campaign, as excellent as it was.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, it seems that much of the creative and organising responsibility will fall on Southwell. The Blues are not just betting on her, they're betting the house.\n\nShe will not be without some play-making support. Olivia Kernick will start at lock and her passing game was a feature of New South Wales's victory in Origin I last year, and utility Jocelyn Kelleher will help off the bench. But when it comes to the killer touches, the spark that feeds the strike, it must be Southwell who leads the way.\n\nShe'll also be tasked with the majority of the kicking, which means she'll have as big a say as anyone can in closing the game out.\n\nFinding that balance between creativity and pragmatism at Origin level is among the hardest tasks any half ever faces. It is not in everyone, but that's why it's the stuff of legend.\n\nIt's what cost the Blues last year as they let the series slip through their fingers with a narrow loss in Newcastle and a comprehensive one in Townsville.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nIt's why Brigginshaw is counted as one of the finest female players in history and why her halves partner, Tarryn Aiken, is rapidly carving out her own place in Origin folklore.\n\nSouthwell has it in her to do the same, and it can begin on Thursday night. She has time and ability on her side, and missing last year's series and the Knights falling short of a third-straight title would have taught the important lesson that football isn't all beer and skittles, which she'll be a better player for learning.\n\nNew South Wales are asking her to put the result on her shoulders and they're asking her to do it now. It's as great an expectation as can be placed on a player, and many an Origin halfback has crumbled under the weight of the challenge, but meeting those expectations is where greatness lies.\n\nThat has always been the endgame for Southwell. Between her fast start to life in top-level football and unquestionable ability, she has always had an impossibly luminous promise.\n\nFulfilling it might take a lifetime, if it can ever happen at all, but the next step begins on Thursday at Lang Park at the moment when the howls of the Queenslanders are in her ears, the ball is in her hands and the game is on the line.",

(ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nOne consequence of the extra weight the SA government might be expected to carry in funding national highways could be less funding available for state and local road networks.\n\nShadow Minister for Transport Ben Hood said a 50:50 funding model would hold SA back.\n\n\"A 50:50 model puts huge pressure on the state budget \u2014 especially for regional roads,\" he said.\n\n\"The premiers of Tasmania and NSW pushed back against the government on changing the split, but we heard nothing from the SA premier or Minister Koutsantonis.\"\n\nBen Hood says the 50:50 funding split will jeopardise road projects. (ABC South East SA: Todd Lewis)\n\nThe model also has local councils concerned.\n\n\"South Australia receives the lowest amount of federal road funding of any state, both on a per capita basis and per kilometre of road,\" a spokesperson for Local Government Association SA said.\n\n\" Councils rely on ad hoc extensions of supplementary funding to make up the gap, but this lack of certainty makes it challenging to plan for long-term maintenance and infrastructure upgrades. \"\n\nThe federal government made the change after a review of government spending.\n\nA spokesperson for federal Transport Minister Catherine King said the Commonwealth's approach to infrastructure funding was recommended by an independent review.\n\n\"It means states need to undertake proper planning on projects, minimise cost blowouts, and it means we can invest in more projects in South Australia while maintaining the same amount of funding overall,\" they said.\n\nThe Coalition said it was committed to the 80:20 model used previously if successful in the upcoming federal election.\n\n'Patch jobs' washed away\n\nIn South Australia's South East, the Southern Ports Highway runs along the coast and connects busy beach towns like Robe, Beachport, and Southend.\n\nThe road is derided by locals as narrow, undulating, and rapidly deteriorating, and was named number six on the RAA's recent Risky Roads list for South Australia.\n\nMargie Bowman knows the highway as well as anyone, having recently retired from driving Beachport's school bus along the road to the nearby Kangaroo Inn Area School.\n\nMargie Bowman recently retired from driving a school bus along the Southern Ports Highway. (ABC South East SA: Sam Bradbrook)\n\n\"It's my worst nightmare \u2014 I don't have to worry about it anymore, but I worry about anyone else having to drive the bus,\" she said.\n\nPlans are in place to completely rebuild the highway between Beachport and Southend, but Ms Bowman said recent roadworks had done little to ease locals' concerns.\n\nSections of the Southern Ports Highway are slated for a $168 million upgrade. (ABC South East SA: Sam Bradbrook)\n\n\"Patch jobs aren't even compacted down anymore \u2026 so when we get rain, it just washes away again,\" she said.\n\n\"It's uneven and until you've got a decent base, it's never going to change.\"\n\nShoulder sealing is part of the work designated for the Southern Ports Highway. (ABC South East SA: Sam Bradbrook)\n\n'A bandaid fix'\n\nIt's a similar story in the Riverland.\n\nThe ongoing $87.5 million Sturt Highway Corridor Upgrade has included works along approximately 210km of the highway.\n\nJodie Harriss lives in Waikerie and drives along the Sturt Highway daily to work in Berri, approximately 60km away.\n\n\"There are several points along that road where there's been repairs, but \u2026 it's just a bandaid fix,\" she said.\n\n\"Before you know it, you've got that hole and that ditch again.\n\nThe Sturt Highway is a critical transport link between Sydney and Adelaide.

(ABC Riverland: Will Hunter)\n\nNot a lot of wriggle room\n\nThe Flinders Highway connects the SA towns of Ceduna and Port Lincoln, past 396km of sand dunes, arid landscapes, and countless dusty offshoots leading to deserted beaches and iconic surf beaches.\n\nIn recent years, caravans and trucks have become more common.\n\nGrain trains ceased operating in the region in May 2019, when Viterra moved its business from the rail to the road, meaning a huge increase in the number of trucks in the area, especially during harvest months.\n\nStreaky Bay and Districts Road Safety Committee president Mischa Karp said tourism had increased in the area, and transport authorities needed to take a look at the width of the road.\n\nFollow the latest election news Photo shows ABC News Radio logo and the ABC Listen logo below it on a light blue background.

He broke in the fifth game of the first set after Shapovalov double-faulted on break point, and again in the ninth, closing out the set with a love game.\n\nThe second set went to a tie-break, but de Minaur took that easily to draw level with Carlos Alcaraz with a tour-leading 24th win of the season.\n\n\"He's got tremendous firepower from every part of the court, and I had to do my best to neutralise it and not let him dictate as much as he could,\" said de Minaur, who has won all five matches with Shapovalov.\n\nDe Minaur is now into his fifth consecutive Masters 1000 last 16 and will next face Lorenzo Musetti, who defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-5, 7-6 (7-3).\n\nIn a boilover, world number 21 Francisco Cerundolo defeated top seed and two-time Madrid winner Alexander Zverev 7-5, 6-3.\n\nBut it was perhaps not such a shock as the Argentine beat Zverev at the same stage last year and has now won all three of their meetings.\n\nGrigor Dimitrov also advanced. He had been 6-4, 5-4 up against Jacob Fearnley when the power went out with the Briton about to serve to stay in the set.\n\nHe did so successfully when play resumed but the Bulgarian won the tie-break for a 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) victory.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

        "text": "Superannuation fund HESTA's seven-week outage has caused financial havoc for member Jan Massey, who says being unable to access her super almost derailed her home purchase.\n\nThe Perth retiree said she had to borrow money from her friends to pay the deposit that was due last week.\n\n\" Everybody's struggling at the moment \u2026 but also, I didn't want to lose this house. So you're kind of in a dilemma, really. \"\n\nMembers of HESTA \u2014 one of Australia's largest super funds \u2014 have expressed outrage and concern after being locked out of their accounts until June, in a planned outage affecting more than 1 million Australians.\n\nMs Massey said she only found out when she went online to check her account in mid-April, despite HESTA having first announced the outage in February.\n\nJan Massey borrowed funds from friends to pay a house deposit after her super fund went offline. (Supplied)\n\nBy the time she learnt of the freeze, it was too late for her to withdraw funds, as HESTA had advised its members to \"make any important changes\" to online accounts by the end of March.\n\nXavier O'Halloran, director of Super Consumers Australia, said many members would have found out about the planned outage late.\n\n\"Super funds don't always have up to date contacts for people and they don't do enough at the moment to make sure they keep those details up to date,\" he said.\n\n\" It's unsurprising to me that a lot of consumers are being caught unawares by this announcement. \"\n\nWith services already offline by the time Ms Massey realised, instead of contacting HESTA, she turned to her friends.\n\n\"I'm embarrassed I have to ask for money,\" she told ABC News.\n\nWhile the former health worker had retired in October last year, the lack of access to her super funds contributed to Ms Massey returning to work for a few weeks.\n\n\"I do feel a sense of panic \u2026 I'm kind of not sleeping very well and thinking, how's this all going to end?\" she said.\n\nAfter ABC News put questions to HESTA, Ms Massey said the super fund contacted her to assist with an application to withdraw funds before the planned recommencement of services in June.\n\nIn a statement, a HESTA spokesperson said, \"we're continuing to support our members through this period of change as we know that, while in the short-term it may be challenging, this transition will provide the technology platform and data capabilities to better service our members in the years ahead.\n\n\" We are sorry for the inconvenience this may cause members and we're working hard to make the transition as smooth as possible. \"\n\nHESTA says the \"planned limited services period\" is common for technology projects of this scale. (ABC News: Emilia Terzon)\n\nLength of outage 'bound to catch people out'\n\nThe reason for the outage is the super fund is changing administration providers, which it first announced in February.\n\nWhile some members wrote to ABC News saying they had received clear communication from HESTA, dozens say they were only made aware of the shutdown period after a report published on Good Friday.\n\nOne super fund member in Perth said his wife received a letter in the mail that advised her of the shutdown period \u2014 however, it arrived three days after the cut-off date for making any important changes to her account.\n\nShe filed a complaint to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) at the start of April, stating \"it is obvious this letter has not been posted in time to give members sufficient notice of impending important changes \u2026 it appears that the trustees have failed in their duty of care to members in this instance.\"\n\nMr O'Halloran said outsourcing administration services leaves super funds \"vulnerable to huge risk\".\n\n\"Risks of bad customer service, risks of being locked into an administrator that takes seven weeks to switch to a new administrator if you're not happy with the level of service,\" he said.\n\nConsumer advocate Xavier O'Halloran says it's unsurprising some HESTA members have been caught unawares. (ABC News: Alex McDonald)\n\n\"That risk all just flows to consumers experiencing really bad customer service.\"\n\nMr O'Halloran said the length of the planned outage is what will impact many Australians.\n\n\"It's far longer than any others that I've managed to find on record, they typically get done in less than a month or so,\" he said.\n\n\" Having seven weeks to process this was bound to catch people out and hit them when they need their money for things like buying a house or major expenses that they've got in their life. \"\n\nMarket experts warn against 'knee-jerk reactions' Photo shows Blue background with black grid and piles of coinsincreasing in height with a shadow. Around half of Australians' superannuation balances are invested in global and local stocks, meaning the tariff-induced market ructions are hitting super savings. Here's why experts say it's not time to panic.\n\nA HESTA spokesperson described it as a \"planned limited services period\" and said it was common \"with complex large-scale technology projects of this nature\".\n\n\"This is a critical phase of the project, designed to ensure the safe and secure transfer of our 1 million-plus members' accounts.\n\n\"We are confident this project will set us up to deliver better outcomes for members, allowing for more personalised experiences that can make it easier for them to manage their super.\"\n\nABC News put questions to APRA, the regulator with oversight of the super sector, but it said it does not comment on individual matters.\n\n\"I think there's serious questions to be asked about how [APRA] took into account any consumer harm that might flow from a very long limited service period,\" Mr O'Halloran said.\n\nWithdrawal requested prior to shutdown delayed\n\nAnother HESTA member, Melbourne woman Martina Neville, said she was informed of the shutdown period back in February and made plans to withdraw funds in March for upcoming bills.\n\n\"I withdrew some money because I knew I had some payments of insurance and registration and so on come up in May [and] June.\"\n\n'Depriving my future self': would-be buyers weigh up super withdrawal Photo shows Jordan looking at a real estate sign out front of a house. With home ownership more out of reach than ever for younger Australians, some are pondering whether their retirement fund would be better off used now, to buy a house.\n\nThe semi-retired occupational therapist said on March 17 she made an application to withdraw $9,000.\n\nOn March 20, she made a second application to withdraw $10,000.\n\nA few days later, Ms Neville received a text message asking her to call HESTA, as the super fund needed more information to process the request.\n\n\"I talked to the operator \u2026 who told me that one of my applications was approved, which was the second one, and I should be getting paid within three to five working days,\" she told ABC News.\n\n\"I was saying, 'how about my first application?' He wasn't so sure, but he will follow it up.\"\n\nA few days later, Ms Neville said she spoke to another consultant who said HESTA had both applications.\n\nBut when the funds landed in her account, it was only for the second application, leaving her $9,000 short of the funds she needed.\n\nWhen Ms Neville followed up again with HESTA, she said the consultant told her the matter would now have to wait until after the planned outage.\n\n\"It's an absolute pain \u2026 I feel stressed because I've got some payments coming up,\" she said.\n\n\"I've got family I could borrow money from but I hate borrowing money, you don't know exactly when you can pay it back because you don't know when the money is coming through.\"\n\nAfter ABC News put questions to HESTA, Ms Neville said the super fund contacted her and processed the application of $9,000.\n\n\"Our contact centre and member engagement teams are actively supporting members with their queries,\" said a spokesperson for HESTA.\n\n\"While there are temporary disruptions to some services, it's important to note that members can still switch investments and receive urgent and critical payments during the limited services period.\"",

        "text": "Members of Darwin's Chinese community are calling for the Australian government and opposition to reconsider their election promises to take back a Chinese firm's lease of the Darwin Port.\n\nThe Northern Territory government leased the port to Chinese-owned company Landbridge for 99 years in 2015, but since then, the foreign ownership of the strategic asset has been the subject of ongoing security debate.\n\nStay updated: Federal election live updates: Get the latest news from the campaign trail Catch the latest interviews and in-depth coverage on ABC iview and ABC Listen\n\nLandbridge is reported to have links to the People's Liberation Army of China, and the US's former Obama administration raised concerns with the Turnbull government after the company was awarded the port lease.\n\nDuring this year's federal election campaign, Labor and the Coalition have each promised to get the port \"back into Australian hands\" either by finding an operator to take over the facility's lease, or, if one can't be found, by compulsory acquisition.\n\nShu Qin Li says members of Darwin's Chinese community are \"disappointed\" and \"sad\" about the major parties' plans to strip the port lease from Landbridge. (ABC News: Tristan Hooft)\n\nThe Northern Territory president of the Australia-China Friendship Society, Shu Qin Li, a long-term resident of the NT, said she believed that move would do economic damage to investor confidence and the territory's economy.\n\nShe said the pledges had come without any evident national security risk, and urged both parties to reconsider.\n\nDarwin's port has been controversial for years. So why the action now? Photo shows A truck drives out of the entrance of the Darwin Port on a sunny day. Darwin Port\u2019s lease to a Chinese-owned company has outlasted successive prime ministers. So why are the major parties talking about cancelling it now?\n\n\"I think it's too political,\" she said.\n\n\"[The NT] should try to focus and look after our own interests \u2026 I mean Darwin, we don't have any major projects, for many years.\n\n\"Darwin Port is probably the one that's still alive \u2026 what else do we have?\n\n\" For people living in the community here forever, like us, we do care, and we feel very disappointed, and very sad. \"\n\nMs Li said community groups such as the Australia-China Friendship Society would lose out on annual event funding from Landbridge if the company lost the port lease.\n\nShe also said her views were widely held within Darwin's generations-old Chinese community.\n\nMembers of Darwin's Chinese community say Landbridge supports cultural events in the city. (Supplied: Chung Wah Society)\n\nThe ABC spoke to others in the NT's Chinese community, who asked not to be named for this article.\n\nOne community member dubbed the federal promises as tapping into \"old paranoia\", while another said \"all international investors should be treated the same and given a fair go\".\n\nThey questioned why the major parties had only made the promises during a federal election campaign, and without any apparent change to national security advice regarding Landbridge's lease.\n\nLandbridge has a 99-year lease of the Darwin Port. (ABC News: Che Chorley)\n\nDefence expert says 'partisan politics' at play\n\nMultiple federal reviews have been undertaken on the Landbridge lease since it was awarded, without any announced risks to national security.\n\nDarwin-based defence expert Victor Abramowicz said it was \"hard to see [the election pledges] as anything aside from partisan politicking on both sides\".\n\n\"The sale was made in 2015, governments of both stripes have been in power over the past decade, [and] none of them have moved to get rid of Chinese ownership of the port,\" Dr Abramowicz said.\n\nVictor Abramowicz says national security advice regarding Darwin Port has not changed. (ABC News: Michael Donnelly)\n\n\"In fact, even the most recent government review in 2023, about 18 months ago, said current arrangements were entirely fine.\n\n\"It's just very hard to believe anything has changed.\n\n\"It's really just a bit of a delicate political environment.\"\n\nDr Abramowicz said if the port lease had to be compulsorily acquired from Landbridge by the Commonwealth, it would likely be a huge sting to Australian taxpayers.\n\n\"That'll be coming straight from the taxpayer's hip pocket, and for no apparent good national security reason,\" he said.\n\nBoth Peter Dutton and Anthony Albanese have pledged to bring the Darwin Port back \"into Australian hands\" this election campaign.

Source: AAP / Daniel Pockett Vanessa Turnbull-Roberts is a Bundjalung lawyer and advocate, and the Commissioner for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children and Young People.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the ceremonies are about respect and connection to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Welcome to countries are actually an opportunity to come together and seek consent on the land that we're walking on and actually be welcomed into a place of community and connection,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are ultimately an invitation to the whole non-Indigenous community to participate in honouring the land and Country that we are on.\"\n\n\n\nWhat is an Acknowledgement of Country?\n\nUnlike a Welcome to Country, an Acknowledgement of Country can be done by a non-Indigenous person. It is often delivered at the start of meetings or events to pay respect to the Traditional Owners.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are sometimes included in podcasts, film and television, and even by some flight captains when landing planes in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no set wording or laws for doing an Acknowledgement of Country.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey often feature phrasing such as: \"I'd like to acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the land on which we meet today. I would also like to pay my respects to Elders past and present\".\n\n\n\nWhy are Welcome to Country ceremonies being debated?\n\nIn an election debate on Sunday, Opposition leader Peter Dutton said he believes Welcome to Country ceremonies are \"overdone\".\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Monday, he said that while it is ultimately up to event organisers, he does not think the ceremonies should be included at Anzac Day services.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why are we debating Welcome to Country?\n\nTurnbull-Roberts told NITV Dutton is in \"no position\" to be determining when or where Welcome to Country ceremonies are conducted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think Dutton as a non-Indigenous person is not the person to be having this discussion, nor should it be up for debate whether he has any buy-in to this conversation at all,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our Welcome to Countries, our Acknowledgements of countries, our places when we choose to do these are on the basis of the Traditional Custodians deciding to do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is not up to Dutton, nor is it up to any other person in a leadership position to determine whether they happen or not.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Nine things that cost more than Welcome to Country ceremonies\n\nLarrakia Elder Richard Fejo said the ceremonies are about being \"inclusive, not exclusive\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are welcoming people to our ancient lands and we're very spiritual people,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I welcome people to my land, I ask that my ancestors guide and protect us always. So we're taking you under our wing and we're introducing you to our spiritual ancestors, we're asking for them to guide and protect you.\"\n\n\n\nWelcome to Country ceremonies are not legally required, but are done as a mark of respect. Source: AAP / Daniel Pockett Fejo said the ceremonies are an important part of the protocols around community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For the people that are out there that say, 'Welcome to Country is overused', you don't know our culture, we know our culture,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are their cultural specialists about our people. And for those of you who would talk about money, talk about all kinds of things, these are excuses not to participate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But we, as Aboriginal people, we know our community, we know our protocols around community and we respect and honour these protocols.\"\n\n\n\nAre Welcome to Country ceremonies required by law?\n\nWelcome to Country ceremonies are not legally required to be done at Australian events.\n\n\n\n\n\nTurnbull-Roberts said it is up to Traditional Custodians and Elders to decide whether a Welcome to Country will take place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For thousands and thousands of years, Welcome to Countries have been practised,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This isn't a new thing, this isn't a new way that we're overdoing, or it isn't something that's just come out of nowhere.

Eight climbers died last year.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Deadly Everest climbing season prompts questions about safety SBS News 09/06/2023 03:49 Play\n\nUnder the proposed law, an Everest permit would be issued only after a climber provides evidence of having climbed at least one 7,000m mountain in Nepal.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sardar, or head of local staff, and the mountain guide accompanying climbers must also be Nepali citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe draft law has been registered at the National Assembly, the upper house of parliament, where the ruling alliance holds a majority required to pass the bill.\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational expedition operators have urged Nepal to allow any 7,000m peak, not just those in the Himalayan nation, for the Everest permit.\n\n\n\nMount Everest is the world's tallest mountain. Source: Getty / Paula Bronstein Lukas Furtenbach of Austria-based expedition organiser, Furtenbach Adventures, said: \"That wouldn't make any sense. And I would also add mountains that are close to 7,000m to that list and that are widely used as preparation, like Ama Dablam, Aconcagua, Denali and others.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFurtenbach, currently leading an expedition on Everest, said mountain guides from other countries must also be allowed to work on Everest, as there are not enough qualified Nepali mountain guides.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Nima Rinji Sherpa on becoming youngest to climb 14 peaks: 'I was born for mountains' SBS Nepali 01/11/2024 10:55 Play\n\n\"It is important that mountain guides have a qualification like IFMGA [International Federation of Mountain Guides Associations], no matter what nationality they are. We do also welcome Nepali IFMGA guides to work in the Alps in Europe,\" Furtenbach told Reuters.\n\n\n\n\n\nGarrett Madison of the United States-based Madison Mountaineering also said a 6,500m peak anywhere in the world would be a better idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's too difficult to find a reasonable 7,000m-plus peak in Nepal,\" Madison said.\n\n\n\nThere are more than 400 mountain peaks in Nepal that are open to expeditions \u2014 of them, 74 are higher than 7,000m, according to tourism department data.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, not many of those peaks are popular among climbers, hiking officials said.\n\n\n\n\n\nTashi Lakpa Sherpa of the 14 Peaks Expedition, a major expedition organising company in Nepal, said: \"Only a few of the 7,000m mountains attract climbers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has climbed Everest, known officially and locally as Sagarmatha in Nepal or Qomolangma in Tibet, eight times.\n\n\n\n",

We have improved the budget position by more than a billion dollars, comparing the pre-election outlook to the costings that we release.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton announced earlier in the month that he will put a cap of around 25 per cent of foreign students admitted to public universities.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a bid to solve the housing affordability crisis in the country, the Coalition had earlier said that they will reduce the number of overseas students coming to Australia each year by around 80,000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor unveiled the cost of commitments made since March's budget on Monday, raising the pressure on the Coalition to release its costings.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the parliamentary budget office doesn't release its full list of costings until after the election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So these costings show that we are managing the budget, and the economy in a responsible and a considered and a methodical way. If you think about the roughly ten billion dollars of commitments that we've made in this election campaign, four billion of that was already provided for and provisioned for either in the budget or the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook, and the other six billion dollars has been more than an offset by the two budget improvements.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo where do Labor's savings come from?\n\n\n\n\n\nSavings will come from student visa fees, which will increase to $2,000 from 1 July 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are anticipating to deliver $760 million to the budget over the forward estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the change will not affect arrangements for Pacific Island and Timor-Leste applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\nKaty Gallagher is the Finance Minister.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A small uplift in student visa - again - we think that's a sensible measure that really prices I think the value of coming here and studying in Australia so that will also be used but that figure is not counted in our savings of over $100 billion dollars. So - we are very pleased that we have been able to do this hard work, we have been able to offset the commitments that we've made post-PEFO*. For those that we have announced beforehand, we've found room in the budget for those.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAn extra $6.4 billion will come from reducing spending on consultants, contractors, and labour hire, as well as non-wage expenses such as travel, hospitality, and property.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Minister says unlike the Coalition's pledge to cut 41,000 public jobs, these savings would not impact any services or programs that the Australian Public Service provides.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cumulative budget deficit will reduce from $151.6 billion to $150.5 billion as a result of the changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will help to cover Labor's $1,000 instant tax deduction for work expenses, which is estimated to cost the budget $2.4 billion over forward estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We got rid of a lot of the waste and the rorts that was embedded in the former government's budgets, and we returned that money to budget and it allowed us - along with finding savings, to find room for those really important cost-of-living measures, that we have been able to deliver through our budgets \u2014 our investments in Medicare, our investments in housing, the income tax cuts, and other measures like lowering HECS debt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Treasurer is urging the Coalition to come clean on their figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now we call on the Coalition now to come clean on their cuts, we've made it very clear what our costs are and how we will pay, for the commitments that we have made in the election campaign. This continues a record of responsible economic management. It is long past time for the Coalition to come clean on their secret cuts to pay for their nuclear reactors. They need to come clean on what their secret cuts for nuclear reactors means for Medicare, for pensions and payments, for skills and housing and other essential investments in the budget.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile Opposition treasury spokesman Angus Taylor has thrown blame on the Treasurer after a credit ratings agency warned that Australia's global credit rating could be at risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nS&P Global Ratings reported that \"off-budget\" election pledges \u2013 for which Labor shared its costings yesterday \u2013 might be compromising Australia's AAA credit rating.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Taylor claims it is Labor, not the Coalition as the Treasurer earlier suggested, that poses the biggest risk to the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We know from the last budget that Labor is delivering 10 consecutive deficits, red ink over the course of the next decade, $180 billion of deficits over the forwards including this year and that's heading us towards $1.2 trillion of debt. The costings today only reinforce that.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nA rare mass power outage caused chaos and disruptions in Spain and Portugal on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nMadrid local Claudia Garcia says there was widespread confusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, the power has gone out. We went out to see if something had happened on the street and no. What we saw was that everyone was saying the same thing: 'No power, no power'. A man passed by in a van and said it was all over Spain, Portugal and also Belgium was without electricity. We don't know to what extent because I was listening to it on the radio.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outage across the Iberian peninsula began around 12.30 pm local time, grounding planes, halting traffic and and forcing some hospitals to suspend routine operations.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Atocha, one of Madrid's main railway stations, passengers stood waiting on platforms, with trains at a standstill.\n\n\n\n\n\nMari Carmen is a train station worker and was left stranded by the blackout. She says she needs to get home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cVery worried, because I am trying to get home. I don't know how, I have my two children at home alone. So it's terrible, I'm trying to get my husband to come in here so I can get home, but I haven't been able to get home, work or do anything. So that's what it is.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOthers were left trapped. Around 35,000 people in Spain were caught on more than 100 trains.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany were stuck in lifts for hours and pleas came over messaging services from those waiting to be rescued.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe blackout left ATM screens blank and many distressed by a loss of wifi and phone connection.\n\n\n\n\n\nPanicked by the confusion, many people in Madrid flocked to supermarkets to stock up on essential supplies such as water, eggs and milk.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo international students in Madrid say they didn't know how much they they needed power to move around the city.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s probably, we\u2019re scared, it shows how dependent we are on it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We were actually most afraid of walking back home without the streetlights.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And also the traffic lights.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Portugal, many supermarkets in Lisbon and the resort town of Vilamoura in southern Portugal had shut.\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands of passengers were also left stranded in the capital's airport.\n\n\n\n\n\nEstefania Caquiagia, who was visiting Portugal from Angola and due to fly home, says there was a tense atmosphere as tourists sat outside the terminal and waited for news about their flights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs you can see this is a flood of people, so boring. Nobody in, nobody out. Boring, thirsty, hungry -- we can\u2019t do anything and here we are completely lost.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSpain's Interior Ministry declared a national emergency and governments from the two countries convened emergency cabinet meetings as officials tried to find out what caused the mass blackout.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Spain's Energy Ministry, the country's network lost 15 gigawatts of electricity generation in five seconds when the outage happened -- a loss of power supply that European systems are not designed to handle.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drop caused Spain and France's grids to disconnect, leading to the collapse of the Spanish electricity network.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the reason for the power loss is still unclear.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says investigations are continuing into the cause of the outage and no possibilities have been ruled out yet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is better not to speculate. We will know the causes later. We are not ruling out any hypotheses. But for now we must focus on the most important thing, which is restoring electricity to our homes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Luis Montenegro says it's likely the blackout in Portugal was caused by the power collapse in Spain.\n\n\n\n\n\nRumours circulated of possible sabotage, however Mr Montenegro says there was no evidence for this theory.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Portugese National Cybersecurity Center said in a statement there was no sign the outage was due to a cyber attack.\n\n\n\n\n\nWidespread power outages are rare in Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2003, a problem with a hydroelectric power line between Italy and Switzerland caused a major outage across the whole Italian peninsula for around 12 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2006, an overloaded power network in Germany caused electricity cuts across parts of Europe and as far as Morocco.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 43 per cent of Spain's energy comes from wind and solar power, with nuclear accounting for a further 20 per cent and fossil fuels 23 per cent, according to energy think tank Ember.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy late Monday, nearly 50 per cent of Spain's electricity supply was restored and Portugal said it was likely that power would be fully restored to the country within hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Madrid, crowds cheered as the lights came back on in parts of the city.\n\n\n\n",

You'll never have me standing up here and say it is safe to do so. I never will. What we are saying - what we are saying - is that we know young people use illicit drugs. We want to see whether this type of testing gives them a final chance to make a difference, to take a different path, to take a different course of action.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has branded a three-day truce announced by his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin as an attempt at manipulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutin ordered the ceasefire to coincide with Moscow's World War II commemorations, which will mark the 80th anniversary of the victory of the Soviet Union and its allies in 1945.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Ukraine says that it wants an immediate truce with Russia for at least 30 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe President has said in his nightly address that that kind of ceasefire would provide a real chance for diplomatic efforts to end the war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We value human lives, not parades. That is why we believe \u2014 the world believes \u2014 that there is no reason to wait until May 8. The fire must be stopped not just for a few days, only to resume killing afterward.

Rents inflation also eased, edging down to 5.5 per cent after being at 7.8 per cent in the March quarter of last year.\n\nFood prices were up 1.2 per cent in the quarter, housing lifted by 1.7 per cent, while there was a large 5.2 per cent jump in education.\n\nThe key measures of underlying inflation were 0.7 per cent, in line with the Reserve Bank\u2019s own forecasts, with the trimmed mean at 2.9 per cent and the weighted median at 3 per cent.\n\nThe biggest factor in today\u2019s figures has been the end of an electricity subsidy in Queensland.\n\nNationally, power prices jumped by 16.3 per cent in the quarter. Without the end of Queensland\u2019s $1000 subsidy, electricity prices would have lifted by 0.4 per cent.\n\nIt meant Brisbane\u2019s inflation rate jumped 1.9 per cent to 2.7 per cent for the year.

I loved getting into political discussions with anyone who\u2019d engage. This mainly involved regurgitating the content of newspaper commentary pages to my grandparents and quoting articles about the failures of mutual obligations policies to creeps with darting eyes on public transport (the joke is on you, eccentrically dressed man who just wanted to sit near a human female).\n\nThis election day, every politician in the country will be filmed gnawing on some unidentified meat in limp white bread.\n\nSince I\u2019ve had kids and life experience, I\u2019ve left hyper-engagement behind, choosing instead to cultivate a world-weariness that matches my character-actor face. Humanity keeps pumping out novel cruelties and down in the \u201canus of the world\u201d (as Jerry Seinfeld once said) we are prisoners to inertia. It is dispiriting to care too much. These days, I only pay attention when I have to vote. The entry-level Australian democratic experience \u2013 standing in line, quietly mocking the independent who\u2019s a little too into \u201ccommonsense gun ownership\u201d, and eventually casting your vote \u2013 is also where the democracy sausage rears its ugly, sausagey head. I hate them, and I want you to hate them too.\n\nBefore I go too deep, I should declare a potential conflict of interest: my parents \u2013 relics of the original hippy era \u2013 raised my siblings and me as vegetarians. At school, I had to bring my foil-wrapped vegetarian sausages on sausage sizzle days. The idea of sausages being remotely celebratory, given their link to a very \u201990s brand of exclusionary regional Australia, has never sat quite right. But honestly, even without that particular trauma, I\u2019d still hate them. I get that to some, the democracy sausage (democrausage?) is a quintessentially Australian tradition \u2013 but to me, it\u2019s inauthentic, low-key jingoistic, and flat-out gross.",

It was the kind of moment emerging artists like me dream about: a national stage, exposure, and the chance for my music to truly be heard. In our industry, being a support act or landing a festival slot is often the only way to get traction and gain credibility.\n\nBut once the adrenaline wore off, reality hit. I\u2019d be joining them across Australia entirely out of pocket with no support for travel, food, accommodation or even equipment. And to be clear, this wasn\u2019t a small indie band pulling together a DIY tour, this was a huge international act.\n\nAthanasia Sakoutis performing in Coogee.\n\nSuddenly, I was weighing the difficult choice of investing thousands of dollars into a career opportunity I could not afford or decline and miss the moment I\u2019d spent years working towards.

Spoiler alert, I declined this opportunity \u2013 unsure if I\u2019d ever be offered something like it again.\n\nIt\u2019s not revolutionary to say, making it in the music industry has always been hard.
