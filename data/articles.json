        "text": "President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to reverse course on his sweeping tariff plan by announcing a three-month pause revealed his threshold for political pain: One week.\n\n\"They were getting yippy,\" Trump said, explaining the rising criticism raining down on the White House over the last week. \"They were getting a little bit yippy, a little afraid.\"\n\nEven for a president famous for his policy bobs and weaves, this morning's announcement he was pausing his long-touted reciprocal tariffs for three months amounted to a stunning reversal of a plan he had appeared only a day earlier to be fully behind.\n\nDonald Trump has backflipped on his sweeping tariffs in less than a week, leaving experts puzzled. (AP)\n\nIt also came as his own trade representative was testifying on Capitol Hill to the benefits of the tariffs, seemingly catching him unaware of the pause.\n\nDays of pressure from fellow Republicans, business executives and even his close friends hadn't appeared to move Trump, who insisted last week: \"MY POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE.\"\n\nBy this morning, however, it had become evident the campaign to convince Trump to change course would not let up. It had also become plain after a sharp sell-off in US government bond markets \u2014 usually a safe corner for investors \u2014 that the economic ramifications of the president's strategy were potentially catastrophic/worse than his advisers had previously predicted.\n\nThe growing alarm inside the Treasury Department over developments in the bond market was a central factor in Trump's decision to hit pause on his \"reciprocal\" tariff regime, according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent raised those concerns directly to Trump on Wednesday (Thursday AEST) in a meeting that preceded the pause announcement, underscoring concerns shared by White House economic officials who had briefed Trump on the accelerating sell-off in the US Treasury market earlier in the day.\n\nCalls to top White House advisors from key business community allies also increasingly focused on the troubling developments in the bond market as they made the case for Trump to pull back.\n\nTrump was posting in favour of his tariffs just hours before his backflip. (Bloomberg)\n\nTrump had not yet made the decision to pause the dramatic new tariff rates when he was posting on social media about the stock market on Wednesday morning, two of the people said.\n\nBut he acknowledged later in the afternoon that he'd been watching the bond market turmoil closely.\n\n\"The bond market is very tricky, I was watching it,\" Trump told reporters. \"The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.\"\n\nSitting in the Oval Office to tap out his announcement, Trump was joined by two advisers who had become dueling faces of the tariff plan: Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.\n\n\"We didn't have access to lawyers or \u2013 it was just wrote up. We wrote it up from our hearts, right? It was written from the heart, and I think it was well written too, but it was written from the heart,\" Trump said afterward, describing a process driven more by impulse than mapped-out strategy.\n\nEven as Trump calmed the markets \u2013 for now, at least \u2013 he also raised new questions by suggesting he would consider exempting some US companies from tariffs, saying he would make any such decisions \"instinctively\".\n\nWhirlwind Wednesday\n\nIt was another whirlwind Wednesday at the White House, with advisers scrambling to keep pace with the president's decisions. He sought to take a victory lap after one of the most humbling retreats of his presidency, eager to take credit for the stock market gains \u2013 without mentioning the record-setting, trillion-dollar losses over the last week.\n\n\"It's the biggest increase in the history of the stock market. That's pretty good,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"If you keep going, you're going to be back to where it was four weeks ago.\"\n\nIf Trump was planning early on Wednesday to pause his new tariffs after days of market turmoil, he did not reveal his intentions widely. Many White House officials heard of his decision at the same time the world learnt, via post on Truth Social, that the new tariffs were on pause.\n\nREAD MORE:\ufeff\n\nAnthony Matesic works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, on Wednesday, April 9. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig)\n\nEven his own top trade official seemed only vaguely aware the change was possible by the time Trump announced the reversal on social media.\n\n\"It looks like your boss just pulled out the rug from under you and paused the tariffs,\" Democrat Steven Horsford of Nevada told US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer during a hearing that was underway on Capitol Hill when Trump made his announcement. Greer had offered zero indication to that point the major shift was coming.\n\nBessent and other officials insisted the decision to pause the new tariffs on all nations except China was not a backdown; instead, they framed the move as all part of Trump's master plan to bring nations to the negotiating table.\n\n\"It took great courage, great courage for him to stay the course until this moment,\" said Bessent, who flew to Palm Beach last weekend for a lengthy discussion with Trump on the endgame of the tariffs.\n\nEven as his advisers danced around it, though, the president acknowledged that the rising criticism, deepening angst and mounting losses in the financial markets contributed to his abrupt decision on Wednesday afternoon to impose a three-month pause on many of the tariffs.\n\n\"I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nAlarm over bond sell-off\n\nThe administration's economic team spent Wednesday morning intensely focused on the bond sell-off that had intensified a day earlier and accelerated aggressively overnight, driving yields higher and, in effect, demonstrating the exact opposite of what would normally happen during such an unstable and volatile moment in the global economy.\n\nHistorically, Treasurys rally in moments of stock market sell-offs as investors rush to shift assets to a global safehaven, the longstanding status due to the safety and liquidity provided by the US market.\n\nWatching the inverse play out, then accelerate after unexpectedly weak demand at the first Treasury Department auction to take place since Trump's announced his tariff regime, led to growing alarm even as Bessent dismissed it as \"uncomfortable, but normal\" in a Wednesday morning television interview.\n\nREAD MORE: \ufeff Eight sought after woman knocked out at football match\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, left, is interviewed by Maria Bartiromo on the \"Mornings with Maria Bartiromo\" program on the Fox Business Network. (AP)\n\nBut for Bessent, whose finance career was deeply intertwined with the bond market and who has been fixated on driving down the 10-year yields in his cabinet post, the alarm relayed by senior Treasury officials was understood and reflected in the later conversation with Trump.\n\nThe president, who is a close monitor of his own coverage on television, had seen even some of his close allies issue dire warnings about the prospects of a recession as a result of the tariffs. He was watching Fox Business channel on Wednesday morning when JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said a recession was \"a likely outcome\" of an escalating trade war resulting from Trump's tariff policies.\n\n\"Markets aren't always right, but sometimes they are right,\" Dimon told Fox Business' Maria Bartiromo.\n\nExecutives light up White House phones\n\nInside the White House, telephone calls had been coming quickly from business executives, Republicans and other allies of the president urging him to reconsider his tariffs, but they received little indication a pause was in the works.\n\nExecutives had been lighting up the phone lines of chief of staff Susie Wiles, Vice President JD Vance, and Treasury secretary Scott Bessent to make the case to Trump directly as trade hawks continued to promote Trump's tariffs-at-all-costs approach on television as the market continued to sink.\n\nWiles, these sources said, had been particularly effective in convincing Trump that the market rout was costing considerable political capital that he would need for future agenda items, with legislators fielding increasingly angry constituent calls as the market continued sinking.\n\nBessent, whose conversation with Trump in Florida over the weekend focused on zeroing in on the overall goal of the tariffs, also appeared to assume more of a role in the public messaging, talking frequently about the dozens of countries now jockeying for trade deals.\n\n\"This was driven by the President's strategy. He and I had a long talk on Sunday, and this was his strategy all along,\" Bessent said on Wednesday.\n\nTrump, however, acknowledged he'd been keeping a close eye on markets, calling their performance \"glum\" over the last few days.\n\nA week after making a tariff announcement that upended the global trading system, the president stood outside the White House in front of three colorful race cars and reflected on what led to his retreat. He sought to take credit for a problem largely of his own making, saying his credibility was not eroded by the whiplash.\n\nWill you boycott American products over Donald Trump's tariffs?

(AP)\n\nBut he hit out at China for what he called a \"lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets\" in justifying yet another tax increase on goods coming from Beijing.\n\n\"At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realise that the days of ripping off the USA, and other countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,\" he said.\n\nIt comes less than 24 hours after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president would not back down on tariffs.\n\n\ufeff\"President Trump has a spine of steel, and he will not break,\" she told reporters yesterday. \"The Chinese want to make a deal, they just don't know how to do it.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Trump would keep the 10 per cent so-called \"baseline\" tariff on most countries.\n\nThe 10 per cent figure had been applied to Australia and several other countries based on the US' trade surplus with them but was meaningfully lower than the 20 per cent tariff Trump had set for goods from the European Union, 24 per cent on imports from Japan and 25 per cent on products from South Korea.\n\nStill, 10 per cent would represent an increase in the tariffs previously charged by the US government.\n\nThe significant backdown came after China further lifted its retaliatory tariffs on US goods from 34 per cent to 84 per cent and European Union countries voted in favour of 25 per cent charges on $US23 billion ($38 billion) in goods coming from the US.\n\nAlex Weitzman works on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, on Wednesday, April 9, 2025.

As an example, it said that a US law that would ban TikTok unless it is sold by its Chinese parent company violates a promise that neither would \"pressure the other party to transfer technology to its own individuals\".\n\nTrump last week signed an order to keep TikTok running for another 75 days after a potential deal to sell the app to American owners was put on ice. ByteDance representatives called the White House to indicate that China would no longer approve the deal until there could be negotiations about trade and tariffs.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump in Beijing in 2017. (AP)\n\nThe paper also argued that taking into account trade in services and US companies' domestic Chinese branches, economic exchange between the two countries is \"roughly in balance\".\n\nIt says that China had a trade in services deficit with the US of $US26.57 billion ($44 billion) in 2023, which is composed of industries like insurance, banking and accounting. Trump's tariffs were designed to close trade deficits with foreign countries, but those were calculated only based on trades in physical, tangible goods.\n\n\"History and facts have proven that the United States' increase in tariffs will not solve its own problems,\" said the statement from the Chinese commerce ministry.\n\n\"Instead, it will trigger sharp fluctuations in financial markets, push up US inflation pressure, weaken the US industrial base and increase the risk of a US economic recession, which will ultimately only backfire on itself.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds a signed executive order during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden of the White House, Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Washington.

On Tuesday, the S&P 500 careened between a gain of 4.1 per cent and a loss of 3 per cent for a second straight day of shocking reversals.\n\nWall Street's latest moves came after Trump's latest round of tariffs kicked in after midnight for imports from around the world.\n\nThat included a 104 per cent tax on things coming from China, and the world's second-largest economy quickly retaliated by saying it would raise tariffs on US goods to 84 per cent on Thursday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) dinner at the National Building Museum in Washington, Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (Pool via AP) (AP)\n\n\"If the US insists on further escalating its economic and trade restrictions, China has the firm will and abundant means to take necessary countermeasures and fight to the end\" the Ministry of Commerce said.\n\nSuch aggressive brinkmanship between the world's two largest economies is raising fears that tariffs will stick around for a while, which economists and investors expect would create a recession. The European Union on Wednesday also approved tariffs affecting $US23 billion ($38 billion) in US goods in its own retaliatory move.\n\nSome hope still does remain on Wall Street that Trump could lower his tariffs following negotiations with other countries, which is what's helping to send stock prices upward at times.\n\nREAD MORE: Treasurer and RBA in emergency meeting\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) (AP)\n\n\"BE COOL!\" Trump said on his Truth Social platform shortly after trading began on Wall Street.\n\n\"Everything is going to work out well. The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!\"\n\nSome of Wednesday's strongest action was in the US bond market, where Treasury yields rose sharply again. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.37 per cent from 4.26 per cent late Tuesday and from just 4.01 per cent at the end of last week. It approached 4.50 per cent earlier in the morning. That's a huge move for the bond market and could be an indication of stress.\n\nAnalysts say several reasons could be behind the move, including hedge funds and other investors having to sell their Treasury bonds to raise cash in order to make up for sharp losses in the stock market. Investors outside the United States may also be selling their US Treasurys because of the trade war. Both actions would push down prices for Treasurys, which in turn would push up their yields.\n\nPanic on Wall Street as Trump announces new tariffs View Gallery\n\nRegardless of the reasons behind it, the higher yields on Treasurys add pressure on the stock market and will likely push up rates for mortgages and other loans for US households.\n\nAll the uncertainty about tariffs is already making planning more difficult for big US companies.\n\nDelta Air Lines pulled financial forecasts for 2025 Wednesday as the trade war scrambles expectations for business and household spending and depresses bookings across the travel sector.\n\n\"With broad economic uncertainty around global trade, growth has largely stalled,\" CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) (AP)\n\n\"In this slower-growth environment, we are protecting margins and cash flow by focusing on what we can control.\"\n\nWalmart, though, said it's sticking with its forecasts for sales and operating income over the full year.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes tumbled across most of Europe and much of Asia.\n\nLondon's FTSE 100 dropped 2.2 per cent, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 sank 3.9 per cent and the CAC 40 fell 2.6 per cent in Paris.\n\nChinese stocks were an outlier, and indexes rose 0.7 per cent in Hong Kong and 1.3 per cent in Shanghai.",

There is a great deal of fear and apprehension,\" he said.\n\n\"To paraphrase Bec [Shaw], we're watching the world being burned down by powerful men - we just didn't know they would be such losers.\"\n\nBandt quoted a January headline written by freelance journalist Shaw in The Guardian which read: \"I knew one day I'd have to watch powerful men burn the world down \u2013 I just didn't expect them to be such losers.\"\n\nHis reference drew laughter in the press club before Bandt switched to a more serious note.\n\n\"But seriously \u2013 people are holding their loved ones close,\" the Greens leader said.\n\n\"People are flicking through news articles in their feeds because it is too distressing.\n\n\"People are thinking about their future.

        "text": "Financial markets don't like fear and uncertainty, which become a vicious self fulfilling prophecy. The more value that's shed, the greater the fear and uncertainty, as the markets tumble lower and lower.\n\nThe falls we're seeing on global share markets right now are on a scale not seen since the dark days of the Covid induced lockdowns five years ago. This time the panic is being triggered by one thing - US President Donald Trump's tariffs that he calls \"beautiful\".\n\nBeauty of course is in the eye of the beholder, and there's nothing beautiful about the bloodbath of Wall Street shedding around 10 per cent, or Australian losses of more than 7 per cent since the global reciprocal tariffs from the US were announced.\n\nFinancial markets globally have collapsed in recent days. (AP)\n\nThe tariffs themselves are not a surprise. They were a major part of Donald Trump's re-election platform where he repeatedly vowed to impose tariffs to pay for tax cuts for all Americans.\n\nThe size of the tariffs though has come as a surprise. Many traders also wrongly assumed that tariffs would simply be used as a bargaining tool to get what Donald Trump wants because bluff and bluster is the way he's previously done business.\n\nThis time though the threat is being delivered, with no exceptions. Tariffs are being imposed on every country around the world, friend or foe.\n\nIn a direct sense, Australia has gotten off pretty lightly. America is not a big market for our exports, making up around 6 per cent of our trade, so the 10 per cent tariffs we've been hit with won't do much damage to our economy.\n\nThe real damage will come from the impact of much higher tariffs on our largest trading China, which has escalated the trade war with the US by imposing retaliatory tariffs on US goods, and now Donald Trump is threatening to hit China again.\n\nThat vicious cycle rears its ugly head again, and there are no winners from a trade war, only the prospect of a global recession.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump pushes tariffs on China to shocking 104 per cent\n\nWall Street has lost a tremendous amount of money in the past week. (AP)\n\nSo as fear and uncertainty sends financial markets into freefall, what should investors and retirees, or those approaching retirement be doing, as we see the value of share portfolios and superannuation accounts also plummet?\n\nWhat we shouldn't do is panic - which is easier said than done if you don't have time on your side to wait for markets to come back up, which they will do eventually. History shows that as economies and wages grow, markets rise, despite the periodic falls triggered by wars or pandemics or the complete upheaval of global trade that Donald Trump is trying to engineer.\n\nDo you think the world is heading towards a recession? Yes 12974 No 1660\n\nIf you manage your own investments, this is a timely reminder to consider dialling down the amount of risky assets you hold, particularly if you're approaching retirement age. Having a cash buffer can also help to avoid having to sell off assets that have seen their value plunge.\n\nInvestments are for the long term, and the trend is your friend when it comes to financial markets. What goes down should eventually come back up.

Plummeting markets had clearly been fearing the \"demon\" approach.\n\nWhen Trump was asked earlier this week if his tariffs were locked in or up for negotiation, he said both things could be true.\n\n\"There can be permanent tariffs and there can also be negotiations,\" Trump said.\n\nGoing around the wall\n\nShortly after Trump paused his \"reciprocal\" (but not actually reciprocal) tariffs, the White House began framing the move as part of a master plan.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent described Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs regime as a \"successful negotiating strategy\". (Reuters: Nathan Howard)\n\n\"We saw the successful negotiating strategy that President Trump implemented a week ago today,\" said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is known to favour a more targeted approach to tariffs.\n\nWhat is a tariff? A tariff is a tax on a product imported from another country\n\nfrom another country It is paid to the government by the company that imports the product\n\nthat imports the product A tariff is generally calculated as a percentage of the price paid by the importer to the foreign seller\n\npaid by the importer to the foreign seller Historically, tariffs have pushed up prices because higher product costs are often passed on to consumers\n\nPress secretary Karoline Leavitt \u2014 who on Monday called reports of a possible pause \"fake news\" \u2014 told reporters they'd \"clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here\".\n\n\"Many of you in the media clearly missed The Art of the Deal,\" she said, a reference to Trump's 1987 business memoir, in which he advocates doing \"anything within legal bounds to win\".\n\nBut later, when Trump himself was asked why he'd hit the pause button, he said it was because \"people were jumping a bit out of line\".\n\n\"They were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid,\" he said outside the White House.\n\nAnd when he was asked if the markets had anything to do with the decision, he responded by saying he'd been \"watching the bond market\".\n\n\"The bond market right now is beautiful,\" he said. \"But, yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.\"\n\nHe was also asked about his credibility after the \"fake news\" pause became real news.\n\n\"You have to have flexibility,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I could say, 'Here's a wall and I'm going to go through that wall. I'm going to go through it no matter what.' Keep going and you can't go through the wall. Sometimes you have to be able to go under the wall, around the wall, or over the wall.\"\n\nA win for the angels?\n\nEven if we accept today's turnaround was always on the cards, there's clearly been tension in Trumpland over which path the president should take.\n\nLoading...\n\nOne of Trump's \"angels\", Cruz says, is Elon Musk, the president's DOGE sidekick who has been making his reservations about tariffs well known.\n\nThat would make Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro a \"demon\".\n\nNavarro is known to be tariffs hardliner. He's likely a big part of the reason Australia's found it so hard to get any exemptions despite its trade deficit with the US.\n\nHe's also a \"moron\", according to Musk.\n\n\"Navarro is dumber than a sack of bricks,\" he tweeted this week, leading to Leavitt's \"boys will be boys\" press briefing in which she acknowledged the \"diverse\" competing voices in Trump's inner circle.\n\nTrump loyalist Peter Navarro is a big believer in tariffs. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque)\n\nThe pause could be seen as a win for the White House \"angels\".\n\nThey will now be hoping to see some deals struck soon, with concessions from trade partners Trump will be able to portray as big wins.\n\nTrump says more than 75 countries now want to negotiate. Strategic Asian partners such as Japan and South Korea look to be near the head of the queue for talks.\n\nAustralia is in a good position too, though the 10 per cent minimum tariff still could prove tricky to negotiate away.\n\nBut a big part of what happens next will come down to which voices Trump chooses to listen to.\n\nAn awful lot can happen in 90 days.\n\nJust look at how Trump's changed America and the world in the 80 since he became president.",

(Getty Images: ISI/John Todd)\n\nThe IOC said the reason for the sharp increase in women's soccer teams was the rapidly growing popularity of women's team sports, especially in the United States, and that change in the competition format reflected that rapid growth.\n\n\"We wanted to do something to reflect that growth and equally with the United States being the home of the highest level of popularity of women's football,\" IOC sports director Kit McConnell told a press conference.\n\nThe ascendancy of the women's tournament will take place 32 years on from the first women's Olympic football tournament which took place in Atlanta in 1996.\n\nThat was won by the USA, the first of their record five titles, including the gold they won in Paris last year.\n\nMcConnell said the IOC had discussed the issue with both LA Games organisers and world soccer's governing body FIFA before going through with the changes.\n\nAdditionally, two more women's teams were added in water polo \u2014 which Australia won the silver medal in Paris \u2014 so it would gain parity with the men's event at 12 nations each.\n\nAustralia's women's water polo team won silver in Paris.

        "text": "If Hollywood works the way it does in the popular imagination, then Cillian Murphy presumably could have cashed in his Oscar-winning performance in Oppenheimer for any number of leading-man offers: the dreamy, conflicted man of science presiding over an apocalyptic thriller; a brooding hit-man dispensing existential bon mots over bone-crunching beat-downs; a galaxy-eyed supervillain in the next multi-million dollar Marvel movie that nobody in particular cares about.\n\nFast facts about Small Things Like These What: In 1985, an Irish coal merchant discovers a dark secret at a convent whose sisters wield power over the town. Starring: Cillian Murphy, Emily Watson, Eileen Walsh, Zara Devlin Director: Tim Mielants When: In cinemas now Likely to make you feel: Quietly moved\n\nInstead, he's done what any self-respecting Irishman with limited interest in stardom might do, and returned to his homeland \u2014 and to his old collaborators \u2014 for a sombre, knitwear-clad drama about a family man wrestling with the dark secrets preying on a small town. (Proving his dedication, Murphy actually pitched the project to co-producer Matt Damon while on the set of Christopher Nolan's blockbuster.)\n\nIn Small Things Like These \u2014 which is based on Claire Keegan's acclaimed, prize-winning 2020 novel \u2014 Murphy is all gloomy grey beanies and dirty fingernails as Bill Furlong, a hardworking coal merchant and well-loved father of five girls in the quiet, drizzly Irish town of New Ross.\n\nIt's Christmas 1985, although aside from the sound of 'Come On Eileen' squeaking from a pub jukebox, the sleepy port town might as well exist out of time.\n\n\"[Author Claire Keegan] is so precise in what she chooses to say ... and that's perfect for [director Tim Mielant]'s way of working,\" Eileen Walsh (pictured) told Radio Times. (Supplied: Roadshow)\n\nBill himself is a man adrift, increasingly unmoored from a clockwork life and otherwise loving family. It's an impression that Murphy's boyishness, even in middle age, lends itself to perfectly; he's a man with one foot in childhood, haunted by memories to his life as a lonely, bullied child back in the 1950s, when he lived with his single mother.\n\nThe flashbacks are beginning to worry his wife, Eileen (Eileen Walsh), who fears her husband is on the verge of a breakdown, and Bill's episodes are only exacerbated after he stumbles upon Sarah (Zara Devlin), a young woman five months pregnant and locked, shivering and distressed, in a freezing shed.\n\n\"[These women] were just taken out of society, sometimes for just being too attractive,\" Murphy told CBC. (Supplied: Roadshow)\n\nBill delivers Sarah to the local convent, where the sisters' veneer of compassion can barely disguise their sinister motives. When he meets the mother superior (Emily Watson), by turns warm and secretive, it's apparent that something untoward is afoot.\n\nDespite a title that sounds suspiciously similar to (and most likely inspired) this classic tweet, Small Things Like These is anything but twee contemporary fiction.\n\nKeegan, the writer behind 2022's sleeper hit The Quiet Girl, drew her tale from the notorious Magdalene Laundries scandal in Ireland, in which asylums set up for \"fallen women\" were exposed to have engaged in decades of abuse.\n\n\"It's the most unholy, un-Christian thing that she [Sister Mary] presides over,\" Emily Watson told Deadline. (Supplied: Roadshow)\n\nThere's menace rippling under the movie's slow-burn exterior. As in the real-life events, the members of the convent wield enormous influence over the good Catholic townsfolk, and at one point even threaten the education of Bill's kids \u2014 to every effect, they're mafia with a habit.\n\nThe knowledge that the Catholic Church was up to no good is hardly breaking news, but the movie nonetheless has a quiet power and grace, telling a story of corruption and control that remains resonant.\n\nDeftly written by Irish playwright Enda Walsh \u2014 whose stage play (and later, film) Disco Pigs gave Murphy his early career breakout \u2014 and directed with unfussy modesty by Tim Mielants (Peaky Blinders), the film is empathic and clear-eyed, in spite of material that could easily have lent itself to clich\u00e9.\n\n\"It's a book written by a woman about a man ... but it's actually a story about women, really,\" Murphy told Radio Times. (Supplied: Roadshow)\n\nMurphy is the essential element here; he holds the movie together through sheer force of presence, even as it sometimes threatens to tread familiar terrain.\n\nHis performance is a study in compassion and survival, in the ways one's own traumatic experience might lead to empathy instead of cyclical abuse. Here's a man raised by a single mother, and a foster mother, a man who has possibly been abused himself, who has taken his own pain and transformed it into something almost maternal.\n\nIt's all there in Murphy's silence; he's one of the rare modern actors capable of conveying emotional depth while speaking very little, of suggesting decades of repressed trauma with a look. Of course, those expressively opaque eyes, popping like street lamps against the Irish winter, don't go astray, either.\n\nAs he did in Oppenheimer, Murphy suggests worlds of conflict beyond the word. In repose, his stillness says so much.",

        "text": "Donald Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs have caused chaos, up-ending stock markets and sending world leaders scrambling.\n\nAccording to the Trump administration, more than 70 countries are lining up to try and negotiate their way out of the new levies of up to 49 per cent \u2014 which have mostly now been \"paused\".\n\n\"These countries are calling us up, kissing my ass,\" the US president told a Republican event this week in Washington.\n\nMany have pre-emptively offered to cut their tariffs on US imports and start buying more American exports.\n\nBut Mr Trump and his advisers may have a much bigger prize in mind.\n\nSome believe the tariffs are just the first step in a grand strategy to reshape global trade, boost US manufacturing, reduce the US budget deficit and make America's allies pay for the US security umbrella.\n\nIt's being called the Mar-a-Lago Accord.\n\nIt's never been confirmed by the Trump administration and is widely regarded by economists as a terrible idea that won't work.\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean that Mr Trump isn't going to try and make it happen.\n\nWhat is the Mar-a-Lago Accord?\n\nThe details are complicated and involve a lot of finance theory.\n\nPut simply, the plan is essentially to get other key economies to agree to pump up their own currencies and help devalue the US dollar.\n\nThis would hopefully achieve the US administration's stated goals of making goods produced in America more competitive and boost its manufacturing industry.\n\nHowever, it would also make participants' exports less competitive.\n\nThe accord was outlined among a range of options in an essay last year by economist Stephen Miran, who has since been appointed chairperson of the US Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nStephen Miran's essay has been seen by some as a possible blueprint for Donald Trump's economic plans. (Reuters: Annabelle Gordon/file)\n\nIn the paper, Mr Miran argues the \"overvaluation\" of the US dollar is the reason for America's large trade deficit.\n\n\"Such overvaluation makes US exports less competitive, US imports cheaper, and handicaps American manufacturing,\" Mr Miran wrote.\n\nThe Mar-A-Lago Accord references Mr Trump's Florida resort Mar-a-Lago and the Plaza Accord of 1985 in which America's allies Germany, Japan, the UK and France agreed at New York's Plaza Hotel to jointly devalue the US dollar to boost America's industrial performance.\n\nMr Miran wrote that important economies such as China's and those in Europe would be less willing now to join a new accord, but tariffs could be a useful \"stick\".\n\n\"President Trump views tariffs as generating negotiating leverage for making deals,\" Mr Miran wrote.\n\n\" It is easier to imagine that after a series of punitive tariffs, trading partners like Europe and China become more receptive to some manner of currency accord in exchange for a reduction of tariffs. \"\n\nHe wrote that a currency accord with major economies could involve partner countries selling US dollar assets and swapping short-term US treasuries for century bonds.\n\nUS treasuries, or treasury bonds, pay interest over their term while century bonds don't and are only returned with an increased value once they mature after 50 or 100 years.\n\nThis could help finance the staggering costs of America's world-spanning military, he said.\n\nChina and EU retaliate against US tariffs as trade war escalates Photo shows close up of china president xi jinping in front of us flag Stock markets dropped following Beijing and the European Union's announcement of new tariffs on US imports.\n\nMr Miran said that under a currency accord plan, both tariffs and the threat of the US withdrawing security guarantees from countries involved in the deal would be used to ensure compliance with it.\n\nHe suggested that US security, trade and finance are joined, and that there was interest in getting countries to pay for America's security guarantees.\n\nMr Miran has described his paper as a \"menu\" of options, and said he wasn't advocating any particular option.\n\nWhen asked by Bloomberg last month if some kind of currency accord was in the works, Mr Miran said Mr Trump was \"very clear that he wants to start with tariffs\".\n\n\"We are starting with tariffs,\" he said.\n\n\"Could a [currency pact] be something that is entertained down the road? Sure it could. But right now the president is focused on tariffs.\"\n\nDonald Trump has hosted world leaders at Mar-a-Lago previously. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque/file)\n\n'A new economic golden age'\n\nComments from Mr Trump's team seem to hint it has something big planned.\n\nSecretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent said during a Senate Finance Committee hearing in January that Mr Trump has a \"generational opportunity to unleash a new economic golden age that will create more jobs, wealth and prosperity for all Americans\".\n\n\"We can usher in a new, more balanced era of prosperity that will lift up all Americans and rebuild communities and families across the country,\" he added.\n\nPeter Navarro, Mr Trump's senior counsellor for trade and manufacturing, has made it clear that other countries offering to lower their tariffs will not be enough.\n\nWhat is a tariff? A tariff is a tax on a product imported from another country\n\nfrom another country It is paid to the government by the company that imports the product\n\nthat imports the product A tariff is generally calculated as a percentage of the price paid by the importer to the foreign seller\n\npaid by the importer to the foreign seller Historically, tariffs have pushed up prices because higher product costs are often passed on to consumers\n\n\"They're coming now and saying we want to talk, we'll lower our tariffs to zero if you lower your tariffs,\" he told Fox News this week. \"That's not the problem. Vietnam is a great example.\"\n\n\"They sell us $15 for every one we sell them. Zero tariffs would get us no reduction in the $123 billion deficit we have.\"\n\nDespite this, not everyone is convinced there's a strategy in the works.\n\nDavid Henig, from the European Centre of International Political Economy, told the ABC there were a lot of people pushing their ideas for how the world economic system could change.\n\n\"None of them obviously to me have captured the attention of President Trump,\" Mr Henig said.\n\nMr Henig said while it wasn't impossible, it was hard to see the tariffs now \"as a first step in some bigger strategy\" toward a complex currency accord.\n\n\"I'm not sure there's enough skill and analytical capacity in the current White House to pull this [currency accord] off,\" he said.\n\n\"I think you would need some nifty footwork of the likes we haven't really seen from this administration \u2026 to get to a point where countries want to do deals with you like the really sophisticated Plaza Accord.\"\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is now leading tarrif negotiations for the Trump administration. (ABC News: Bradley McLennan)\n\nWhy wouldn't the Mar-a-Lago Accord work?\n\nIn an opinion piece for the Lowy Interpreter, former chief economist at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Jenny Gordon wrote that the ideas outlined by Mr Miran were unlikely to deliver the reduced deficits and bring back the good jobs that were the primary motivation.\n\nDr Gordon said the logic was flawed for a number of reasons including that:\n\nThe US would need to borrow money to reinvest in its manufacturing sector, which would increase the value of the US dollar \u2014 the opposite of what the accord aims to do;\n\nChanging consumer patterns, technology and aging populations had done as much, if not more than global trade, to drive well-paying jobs out of America's industrial heartland; and\n\nThe plan would see countries move away from the US dollar as the reserve currency, and Mr Trump has said he doesn't want that.\n\nShe concluded that countries were not likely to want to sign up to any deal because of Mr Trump's conduct.\n\n\"Trump's treatment of allies will hardly provide reassurance that complying with such an accord will buy stability. Even if quite a few countries do comply, it will not solve the US deficit problem,\" she said.\n\nLord Daniel Hannan, president of the Initiative for Free Trade and a member of the UK House of Lords, told the ABC Mr Trump's policy was \"the most damaging policy and utterly needless\".\n\n\"It's completely self-inflicted,\" Lord Hannan said.\n\n\"If you did think that manufacturing deficits were a problem this is not how you would go about fixing it.\n\n\"It's not possible to simultaneously to tackle the deficit problem and to keep a devalued US dollar as the world's currency.\"\n\nHe said countries around the world wouldn't agree to things that weren't in their economic interest because the US wanted them to.\n\n\" The people who are claiming that there is some clever nine-dimensional chess going on here are deluding themselves because they don't want to face up to the banal reality that this is a needless policy that will impoverish people. \"\n\nIn his essay, Mr Miran said that the US needed to offer incentives for trading partners to come on board with the currency accord.\n\nSo far, Mr Trump has used tariffs only as a bargaining tool to reduce import levies on US goods abroad and raise revenue at home.\n\nDonald Trump has remained defiant as his tariff policy has caused global market chaos. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque)\n\nJapan first to negotiate US tariffs\n\nAmong the first countries Mr Trump's team has agreed to meet with is Japan.\n\nThe United States is Japan's biggest export destination, with roughly 28 per cent of the total comprised of automobile shipments.\n\nMr Trump's decision to slap a 25 per cent levy on auto imports, and a reciprocal 24 per cent tariff on other Japanese goods is expected to deal a huge blow to Japan's economy.\n\nSome analysts predict the higher duties could knock up to 0.8 percentage points off economic growth.\n\nJapan also depends on the US military for protection.\n\nUnusually, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is leading the negotiating team, posting on X that the US would \"work to enact the President's vision for a new Golden Age of Global Trade\".\n\nUS breaks with reality on tariffs Photo shows Donald Trump wears a blue suit, white shirt and red tie holding a booklet showing off his signature to the camera The Australian government after May 3 will no doubt want to try to negotiate with the Trump administration about our 10 per cent tariff, but they might be better off to just work around it and move on.\n\nTrade talks are usually led by the US trade representative.\n\nJapan's former top currency diplomat, Naoyuki Shinohara, told Reuters any US attempt to secure a coordinated depreciation of the US dollar through a 1985 Plaza Accord-type deal likely wouldn't work, because it would require the consent of China and Europe.\n\nMr Shinohara said unlike the Plaza Accord, when the United States worked only with close allies, Washington would need to engage more countries \u2014 including the China and European Union \u2014 to weaken the dollar effectively in a globalised market.\n\n\"Currency intervention, even if coordinated among nations, has become less effective because markets have become so big,\" he said.\n\nHe added that Mr Trump's decision to impose levies on China and Europe would make it extremely difficult to gain their consent.\n\nBoth have responded with tariffs of their own, with the US and China involved in an escalating tit-for-tat battle.\n\n\"In times like now, you need China to be in the loop, as well as European nations. That would be quite hard under the current circumstances,\" Mr Shinohara told Reuters in an interview.\n\nABC/wires",

        "text": "Sydneysiders have been marvelling at the district exhibits at the Sydney Royal Easter Show for 125 years.\n\nThey are often spectacular affairs, built by large teams featuring thousands of items of fresh produce.\n\nThe job is a complex and challenging as it was 125 years ago.\n\nThe style of the exhibits has changed over the years. (Supplied: Royal Agricultural Society)\n\nDistrict Exhibits history\n\nThe idea for an exhibition started in 1876 when three areas or \"courts\" were set up in the Prince Alfred Exhibition Hall to display produce from several parts of the colony in the years before Australia became a federation.\n\nGetting the produce to Sydney was a huge challenge, with much of it going by steamship and rail.\n\nIn 1899 Frederick Webster, secretary of the Royal Agricultural Society, travelled to the regions to determine the support for a competition between regional societies.\n\nThe first one was scheduled for the following year.\n\nArchival documents from the Royal Agricultural Society record Mr Webster's thinking about the idea.\n\nThe District Shield was first awarded in 1911. (Supplied: Royal Agricultural Society)\n\n\"[Metropolitan] manufacturers, exporters and wholesale merchants, who know little or nothing of the abundant products of the country, will become familiar with the specific capabilities of each district, following which the enterprise and industry of producers will be stimulated and rewarded,\" he wrote.\n\nHe expected the exhibit to be \"one of the grand events of 1900 \u2026 which will surpass in general excellence and grandeur all previous gatherings of the kind held in Australia\".\n\nPreserves were a crucial way to keep summer fruit to eat during winter. (Supplied: Royal Agricultural Society of NSW)\n\nChanging exhibits\n\nThe first regions to compete were Clarence, Central New England, Grenfell, Mudgee, Nepean, Orange and Tumut.\n\nThe districts have since changed to Western, Northern, South-East Queensland, and Southern & Central.\n\nLindy Pollock and Brooke Beales taste cherry jam at the 2025 Royal Easter Show. (ABC Rural: David Claughton)\n\nRoyal Agricultural Society of NSW Agricultural Committee chair Hunter White said initial produce displays were simple.\n\n\"When they first started, if you see some old pictures, they're very structured and there's pyramids of apples, things in nice rows, and even the people standing in a military line,\" he said.\n\nOver the decades they evolved to mark important events, anniversaries, good seasons and bad ones, as well as the spirit of the land and the resilience of those who worked it.\n\n\"Today, environmental themes are quite strong,\" Mr White said.\n\nModern exhibits focus on key messages. (Supplied: Royal Agricultural Society)\n\nLook closely at the produce\n\nBut the key to the District Exhibits is not the theme, but the produce that is in the display.\n\nMr White said 90 per cent of the judge's score was determined by the quality of the fruit, vegetables, grains, and how well they performed on farm as opposed to how the exhibit looked.\n\nHunter White oversees the produce going into the 125th District Exhibit at the Sydney Royal Easter Show. (ABC Rural: David Claughton)\n\n\"What they look out for at the end of the day is the nutritional value, and as agriculturalists, maximising the yield to the inputs,\" he said.\n\n\"It's quite a tradition.\"\n\nThere are more than 50 judges involved.\n\nThey assess thousands of items of fresh produce that may have been stored for months and transported thousands of kilometres before being placed on display.\n\nLeigh James and Roweena Peetree are judging heritage root vegetables. (ABC Rural: David Claughton)\n\nHeritage plants\n\nThe exhibits are also a window into foods grown in the past.\n\nMr White said some root vegetables in the display were not in widespread production, although they were making a return.\n\nHe said produce such as cattle pumpkins, grammas, unusual varieties of watermelons, pie melons, squash and zucchinis were grown as feed, not for human consumption.\n\n\"They were an important part of agriculture in the in the past; conserving fodder for winter time is really their purpose, and the one that stands out are the giant pumpkins,\" he said.\n\nPumpkin bowls\n\nMr White said there were also some unofficial awards given out each year, behind the scenes.\n\nThe Beer Can Trophy goes to the best Merino Fleece in the District Exhibit while the Pumpkin-Bowling Trophy involves a game of bowls played on Good Friday with some of the produce.\n\n\"The proliferation of pumpkins that are just grown for this competition need to go to some good use,\" Mr White said.\n\n\"It's just one of the things the courts do after the competition, we come together and we celebrate.\"",

Almost all countries will now be subject to a 10 per cent tariff, rather than the larger \"liberation day\" rates announced last week. But China will be hit with an extraordinary tariff of 125 per cent.\n\nMr Marles said Australia would pursue its own interests and focus on diversifying its trade, pursuing greater ties with Indonesia, India, the UK and the United Arab Emirates.\n\n\"I don't think we'll be holding China's hand,\" he said.\n\n\"We obviously don't want to see a trade war between China and the US \u2026 [but] it's about pursuing Australia's national interests, not about making common calls with China.\"\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese brushed off the suggestion of \"joining hands\", saying Australia would \"speak for ourselves\", but struck a more accommodating tone.\n\n\"Our trade relationship with China is an important one. Trade represents one in four of Australian jobs and China is by a long distance our major trading partner,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"These trade issues affect 20 per cent of the global market. 80 per cent of trade does not involve the United States. There are opportunities for Australia and we intend to seize them.\"\n\nMr Trump's latest reversal, which reverted all countries except China to a 10 per cent tariff, amplifies the economic threat to Australia because of its reliance on China.\n\nTreasury and RBA modelling suggest the \"China channel\" is the main way the Trump tariffs will affect Australia, with a hit to our exports likely unless China does enough to stimulate its own economy and prop up its demand.\n\nBeijing responded to the first round of tariffs last week with retaliatory tariffs, and Mr Xiao hinted a further response was likely.\n\nChinese ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian said the international community should show solidarity against Donald Trump's tariffs. (ABC News)\n\n\"China has firmly taken countermeasures to protect its legitimate rights and interests and will resolutely continue to do that,\" he said.\n\n\"There is no winner in a trade or tariff war and protectionism leads nowhere.\"\n\nWhat is a tariff?

Where it makes sense to deepen trade ties with China, on terms we are comfortable with\u2026 we will do that. But this isn't about holding hands.\"\n\nBrewing economic storm dominates election week two\n\nTrade Minister Don Farrell met overnight with his EU counterpart to reopen stalled talks on a free trade deal between Australia and the European bloc, and the government continues to lobby for an exemption from the American 10 per cent tariff.\n\nBut with risks to the Australian economy from the broader global uncertainty, the government's economic response featured heavily in last night's first election debate between Treasurer Jim Chalmers and his shadow Angus Taylor.\n\nChalmers and Taylor go head-to-head Photo shows jim angus Jim Chalmers and Angus Taylor clash in an evenly matched TV debate over the budget, productivity, Donald Trump's trade war and their personal weaknesses.\n\nMr Chalmers said the government was \"well placed and well prepared\" for uncertainty.\n\n\"Our response is all about making our economy more resilient, our markets more diverse, and engaging with the world \u2026\n\n\"We've got an opposition leader and an opposition which is absolutely full of these kind of DOGE-y sycophants who have hitched their wagon to American-style slogans and policies and especially cuts which would make Australians worse off,\" he said, referencing Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency [DOGE].\n\nMr said in \"tumultuous times\" the Coalition was better placed to manage the economy. \"When we were last in government, of course, we did take on the Trump administration, and we avoided tariffs,\" he said.\n\nMr Taylor said the government had \"no plans\".\n\n\"Your plan that you put out in your own budget doesn't have our standard of living going back to where it was when you came into government until 2030 or beyond,\" he said.",

Brooks Koepka used the slope behind the hole on the sixth for the last hole-in-one of the day and 115th in the contest's history.\n\nParticipation in the Par 3 is optional, and a handful players \u2014 including Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay and Phil Mickelson \u2014 opted out, choosing to grind on the range or play practice rounds well into the afternoon ahead of the opening round.\n\n\"If you're not ready by now, then you don't really have a chance. This week takes a lot of energy,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"It's a tough walk, it's hilly, and the mental energy you're expending as well.

Not like this. It was horrible,\" he said.\n\n\"I did not have high expectations. I knew I'm going to have a tough opponent and I knew I'm going to probably play pretty bad. But this bad, I didn't expect.\"\n\nYet in the first major European clay-court event of the post-Rafa Nadal era, both de Minaur and Popyrin offered glimpses that they could enjoy their best seasons yet on the surface as they came from a set down in their matches to book last-16 places.\n\nAlex de Minaur plays a backhand on his way to victory over against Tomas Machac of Czechia. (Getty Images: Clive Brunskill)\n\nIn the year after de Minaur finally began to feel like a clay-courter by reaching the French Open quarterfinals, Australia's world number 10 produced an emphatic comeback to subdue Czech Tomas Machac 3-6, 6-0, 6-3.\n\nBased on his fine returning grinding down the Czech, de Minaur's win set up the eighth seed with a round-of-16 date against ninth seed Daniil Medvedev, who came through a testing encounter with Frenchman Alexandre Muller 7-6 (8-6), 5-7, 6-2.\n\nIt will be de Minaur's first encounter with Medvedev since the Aussie was defeated in last year's ATP Finals, but he will be keen to repeat his shock victory over the Russian at Roland Garros, which earned him his first French Open last-eight berth.\n\nPopyrin has had a poor season following his breakthrough 2024 campaign, but there were signs of real promise from the former Roland Garros boys' champ that a decent clay-court campaign awaits as he won his second match in two days from a set down, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, against US 14th seed Frances Tiafoe.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nIt gave the 25-year-old Sydneysider, who blasted 27 winners, a measure of revenge for his defeat by Tiafoe in last year's US Open.\n\nIt's also the first tournament in 2025 in which Popyrin has won two matches, after going into Monte Carlo with a dismal 2-7 record.\n\nA real measure of his improvement, though, may now await when he faces fourth seed, two-time French Open finalist Casper Ruud, in the last-16 after the Norwegian hammered Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2, 6-1.\n\nFrench Open champion Carlos Alcaraz began his clay campaign, which he hopes will lead to a successful French Open title defence, by rallying to a 3-6, 6-0, 6-1 victory over Argentine world number 22 Francisco Cerundolo.\n\nThere was also plenty of emotion as Monte Carlo said farewell to French favourite Richard Gasquet, playing his last event there a 25 years since he played in Monte Carlo as a 15-year-old wildcard. At 38, he lost to German qualifier Daniel Altmaier 7-5, 5-7, 6-2.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to. A newsletter delivered each Saturday.\n\nAAP",

        "text": "An industry expert says the aviation watchdog should have identified the faulty radio that contributed to a fatal mid-air helicopter crash at Sea World on the Gold Coast.\n\nIn a report released on Wednesday, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) found a litany of safety issues led to the joy-flight collision, which claimed the lives of four people and injured nine others on the Southport Broadwater in 2023.\n\nSea World Helicopters chief pilot Ashley Jenkinson, New South Wales woman Vanessa Tadros, and UK couple Diane and Ron Hughes died when the two choppers crashed into each other as one took off and the other came in to land.\n\nThree passengers \u2014 including two children \u2014 were critically injured in the tragedy.\n\nDiane and Ron Hughes died in the crash. (Supplied: Hughes family)\n\nSecond pilot Michael James survived the crash but died of cancer in 2024.\n\nThe ATSB report found a faulty radio antenna in part led to the crash, along with the placement of a new helipad, which created a \"conflict point\" for the aircraft.\n\nInvestigators found it was likely Mr Jenkinson made a taxiing radio call to incoming pilot Mr James but it was unclear if it was ever received.\n\nATSB Chief Commissioner Angus Mitchell says the radio antenna was faulty. (ABC News)\n\nThe report found the radio system in the helicopter being flown by Mr Jenkinson had \"defects that limited transmission range\", and \"it is almost certain that a taxi call was not successfully broadcast\".\n\nThe report said pilots largely relied on a \"see-and-avoid\" strategy to judge the distance between the helicopters.\n\n'Shouldn't have operated with faulty radio'\n\nNeil Hansford, who is an international aviation consultant, said issues with the radio transmission should have been enough to ground the operation.\n\nNeil Hansford says radios should always be sending and receiving signals. (ABC News)\n\n\"It's a motherhood issue that the radios are sending and receiving, let alone in a tight, high-volume, short turn-around operation like this,\" he said.\n\n\" If anything should have been working with a full function, it's the radios and if the radios aren't working, it shouldn't have operated. \"\n\nAccording to the ATSB report, Sea World Helicopters ran high-frequency, low-duration flights.\n\nIn the two weeks prior to the accident, the route where the collision occurred was traversed more than 200 times, the report said.\n\nVanessa Tadros was killed in the crash and her son Nicholas, 10, was seriously injured. (Supplied)\n\nMr Hansford said issues with the radio should have been identified by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) in routine inspections of the joy-flight operator.\n\n\"CASA has an absolute responsibility, at law and by regulation, that all of its operators throughout Australia operate to the approved operating procedures,\" he said.\n\n\"In the end, CASA allowed this operation. They had a responsibility to supervise it and there was an activity that was not compliant because the radio calling was deficient.\"\n\nA Sea World helicopter in the air after being cleared to resume joy flights. (ABC News: Steve Keen)\n\nSea World dedicated to high safety standards\n\nIn a statement, Sea World Helicopters said the accident was a \"devastating tragedy\".\n\n\"Our deepest sympathies rest with the victims, their families, and our staff who have been profoundly impacted by it,\" the operator said.\n\nAsh Jenkinson delivered supplies to flood-affected communities in 2022. (Facebook: Sea World Helicopters)\n\nThe company acknowledged the ATSB's recommendations and said it would \"respond within the allocated time frame\".\n\n\"The accident occurred within a compliant and professionally-managed organisation, which exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements of the general aviation sector,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Our company maintains robust safety systems, dedicated support staff and rigorous oversight protocols to uphold the highest standards of aviation safety.\"\n\nIt said the operator remained \"committed to consistently evolving our safety measures\".\n\nCASA regularly audits Sea World\n\nA CASA spokesperson said in a statement it welcomed the ATSB report and \"will review it in detail for potential safety improvements that can be adopted in addition to action we've already taken\".\n\nIt said action already taken included regulatory, oversight and compliance monitoring of Sea World Helicopters.\n\nCASA says Sea World Helicopters is complying with regulatory requirements. (ABC News: Kirsten Webster)\n\n\"As part of that oversight, CASA conducts routine operational surveillance to ensure the company is complying with regulatory requirements and company procedures, the last audit being completed in October 2024,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"CASA is satisfied Sea World Helicopters is complying with relevant regulations to conduct passenger flights.\"\n\nCASA also conducted a review of the airspace around Southport following the tragedy, which \"found it was appropriate and safe\".\n\nThere has also been an update to passenger safety information regarding the fitting of multi-point restraints when fitted with constant wear life jackets, the CASA spokesperson said.",

        "text": "\u201cI have authorised a 90-day PAUSE,\u201d Trump said in his post on his social platform Truth Social, after recognising the more than 75 countries that he said had been negotiating on trade and had not retaliated against his latest increases in tariffs. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later told reporters that Trump was pausing his so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on most of the country\u2019s biggest trading partners, but maintaining his 10 per cent tariff on nearly all global imports, including those from Australia. \u2018As welcome as the announcement was, investors can\u2019t assume it\u2019s the end of the tariff story, or that the market\u2019s day-to-day volatility will disappear.\u2019 Daniel Skelly, Morgan Stanley It was a starkly different story for China though, though, with Trump saying tariffs were going up to 125 per cent against its products. That raises the possibility of more swings ahead that could stun financial markets. The trade war is not over, and an escalating battle between the world\u2019s two largest economies can create plenty of damage. US stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago, when Trump announced worldwide tariffs in what he called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d. But overnight, at least, the focus on Wall Street was on the positive.\n\n\u201cThe tariff clouds parted for the first time today,\u201d said Daniel Skelly, head of the wealth management market research and strategy team at Morgan Stanley. \u201cBut it\u2019s too soon to know how sunny the skies will be tomorrow \u2013 or 90 days from now \u2026 As welcome as the announcement was, investors can\u2019t assume it\u2019s the end of the tariff story, or that the market\u2019s day-to-day volatility will disappear.\u201d Huge swings have become routine for financial markets worldwide recently, not just day to day but hour to hour, as investors struggle to game out what Trump\u2019s trade war will do to the economy. Credit: AP The relief came after doubts had crept in about whether Trump cared about the financial pain the US stock market was taking because of his tariffs. The S&P 500, which sits at the centre of many pension fund accounts, came into the day nearly 19 per cent below its record set less than two months ago. That surprised many professional investors, who had long thought that a president who used to crow about records for the Dow under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent markets reeling.\n\nWednesday\u2019s rally pulled the S&P 500 index away from the edge of what\u2019s called a \u201cbear market\u201d. That\u2019s what professionals call it when a run-of-the-mill drop of 10 per cent for US stocks, which happens every year or so, graduates into a more vicious fall of 20 per cent. The index is now down 11.2 per cent from its record. Loading Wall Street also got a boost from a relatively smooth auction of US Treasurys in the bond market on Wednesday. Earlier jumps in Treasury yields had rattled the market, indicating increasing levels of stress. Trump himself said on Wednesday that he had been watching the bond market \u201cgetting a little queasy\u201d. Analysts say several reasons could be behind the rise in yields, including hedge funds and other investors having to sell their Treasury bonds to raise cash to make up for losses in the stock market. Investors outside the United States may also be selling their US Treasurys because of the trade war. Such actions would push down prices for Treasurys, which in turn would push up their yields. Regardless of the reasons behind it, higher yields on Treasurys add pressure on the sharemarket and push upwards on rates for mortgages and other loans for US households and businesses.\n\nThe moves are particularly notable because US Treasury yields have historically dropped \u2013 not risen \u2013 during scary times for the market because the bonds are usually seen as some of the safest possible investments. This week\u2019s sharp rise had brought the yield on the 10-year Treasury back to where it was in late February. Loading After approaching 4.5 per cent in the morning, the 10-year yield pulled back to 4.34 per cent following Trump\u2019s pause and the Treasury\u2019s auction. That\u2019s still up from 4.26 per cent late on Tuesday and from just 4.01 per cent at the end of last week. Of course, the trade war is not over. Bessent and Trump clearly showed their anger at China, which has been ratcheting up its own tariffs on US goods and announcing other countermeasures with each move Trump has made. China said earlier it would raise tariffs on US goods to 84 per cent on Thursday. \u201cIf the US insists on further escalating its economic and trade restrictions, China has the firm will and abundant means to take necessary countermeasures and fight to the end\u201d the Ministry of Commerce said.\n\nLater the US Treasury secretary said in a message to countries worldwide, but perhaps most directly aimed at China: \u201cDo not retaliate, and you will be rewarded.\u201d On Wall Street, the gains were widespread across the US sharemarket, and 98 per cent of the stocks in the S&P 500 index rallied. Leading the way were airlines and other stocks that need customers feeling confident enough to travel for work or for vacation. Delta Air Lines soared 23.4 per cent. Earlier in the day, it had pulled financial forecasts for 2025 as the trade war scrambles expectations for business and household spending and depresses bookings across the travel sector. In other international markets, indexes tumbled across most of Europe and much of Asia after they closed before Trump\u2019s announcement. London\u2019s FTSE 100 dropped 2.9 per cent, Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 sank 3.9 per cent and the CAC 40 fell 3.3 per cent in Paris. Chinese stocks were an outlier, and indexes rose 0.7 per cent in Hong Kong and 1.3 per cent in Shanghai.",

        "text": "Last month, CBD revealed that mining giant Rio Tinto was bankrolling the Mabo Centre at the University of Melbourne, an initiative to support traditional owners and First Nations youth that is named after renowned Indigenous land rights campaigner Eddie Mabo, whose High Court case ended the doctrine of terra nullius.\n\nA 1990 photo of Eddie Mabo. Credit: Jim McEwan\n\nFor the company, funding the centre is the next step in a campaign to repair its relationship with First Nations Australians, which was tainted by its destruction of 46,000-year-old Indigenous rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in 2020. The incident brought Rio worldwide opprobrium and led to the resignation of its chief executive, Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques.\n\nDespite efforts to buy back goodwill with Indigenous communities \u2013 the company donated millions to the Yes campaign in the 2023 Voice referendum \u2013 not everyone has forgotten Rio\u2019s recent past. This week, six of Mabo\u2019s grandchildren signed a scathing statement condemning the company\u2019s backing of the Mabo Centre, which the statement accuses of betraying the late Eddie Mabo\u2019s vision.\n\n\u201cWe are mortified that the Mabo name is tied to something so hypocritical,\u201d says the statement, written by artist Neta-Rie Mabo, and co-signed by her cousins Mahalia, Maria, Hannah, Cathryn and Peta.\n\n\u201cWe cannot reconcile our family\u2019s name being tied to a centre funded by the very forces our grandfather fought against. A centre in his name now accepts money from Rio Tinto, a corporation that has desecrated sacred sites and disregarded Indigenous sovereignty. He would be appalled.\u201d\n\nThe statement exposes a division among Mabo\u2019s descendants. His daughter Gail Mabo and grandson Kaleb Mabo both attended the centre\u2019s launch. Gail, a prominent artist, was also featured in an article in The Australian about the centre.\n\nThe six Mabo grandchildren who signed the statement want the centre to cut all ties with Rio Tinto.\n\n\u201cAnything less is a betrayal. Our grandfather\u2019s name deserves better. His legacy is not for sale,\u201d they say.\n\nThe centre\u2019s advisory board issued a statement on Wednesday night saying it was aware of the criticisms but noting the centre\u2019s name was \u201cgifted by senior members of the Mabo family following extensive engagement with them\u201d.\n\nIt said those senior family members were aware of the Rio Tinto investment before deciding whether to gift the name and added that the money did not come with a governance role for the mining giant at the centre. The company declined to comment.",

        "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s about exercising control, what liquidity a broker wants to interact with to achieve better execution quality,\u201d says Roman Ginis, CEO of Imperative Execution, the parent company of IntelligentCross. There are myriad reasons why users may opt for private rooms. Take the case of CastleOak Securities, a New York-based minority-run brokerage. The firm wants to trade with similarly minded businesses, so it uses a private room provided by the ATS operator OneChronos. Credit: Bloomberg Intelligence Carlos Cabana, head of equity sales and trading at CastleOak, dubs the room a \u201cdiversity pool,\u201d because the participants are all minority-operated brokerage firms. While in this instance CastleOak doesn\u2019t know specifically who is on the other side of every trade, it knows it will be one of about 10 counterparties who meet certain eligibility criteria related to ownership and investment goals. \u201cThink of it as an apartment that\u2019s hosting a party, and there\u2019s one purpose for the party with only invited guests,\u201d says Cabana.\n\nThanks to CastleOak\u2019s increasing use of the diversity pool, OneChronos is now its third most-used trading venue, behind only the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, Cabana says. Execution excellence Private rooms are known by a slew of other names including hosted pools, restricted-access rooms, ATS pools, and custom counterparty groups. They\u2019re gaining popularity in the huge, ultra-fast modern market as a way to help firms avoid losing out against players who may be able to move quicker or who have access to superior information. Dark pools are so-called because the trades they handle happen away from the \u201clit\u201d public exchange. Credit: Bloomberg For instance, many brokers and market makers are keen to take the other side of retail investor orders. Those small, less volatile trades are generally unlikely to impact prices \u2014 so a market maker won\u2019t see an adverse move occur the instant it agrees to fill an order, as might happen with another type of counterparty.\n\nBrokers who take orders to private rooms typically expect to fill the order at the midpoint of the national-best-bid and offer, or NBBO (assuming the rule of the room is set up that way, which is usually the case). If for some reason the order is not filled in the room at the midpoint, it can move to the broader ATS where multiple other parties can compete to fill it. And if a broker has bad experiences with a private room, they can change to another in the future, avoiding those counterparties. \u201cThe problem we have is, how do we identify good versus bad liquidity?\u201d says Jatin Suryawanshi, global head of quant strategy at Jefferies, who estimates that 15 in every 100 shares executed by the firm\u2019s algorithms currently move via a room. \u201cIn using private rooms, you can prioritize who you want to interact with.\u201d The growth of private rooms has accelerated as their use has become more common and as stock trading has migrated away from public exchanges. Off-exchange activity has been rising for years in the US, and now frequently accounts for more than half of all recorded volume. Private rooms emerged at the ATS firm LeveL as far back as 18 years ago. LeveL started by allowing firms to match their own orders, in what\u2019s known as internalization. That expanded to other forms of segmentation, including bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements, where one party agrees to trade with another, or multiple parties agree to only interact with each other, within the same ATS. Following requests from its own clients, IntelligentCross started offering its version of private rooms about a year-and-a-half ago, and OneChronos joined the party last year.\n\nPrivate rooms are not generally needed by big banks or brokers who have the resources to create their own ATS or what are called single-dealer platforms. That\u2019s another breed of off-exchange trading venue where the operator is always the counterparty to any trade. But for smaller players, it\u2019s too expensive and cumbersome to build and manage an ATS or SDP, meet the associated regulatory reporting requirements and set up the necessary connections. Arranging a private room at an established ATS is a solution. Loading \u201cThere are various factors of why a firm would want to outsource this activity than keep it in house,\u201d says Steve Miele, CEO of Kezar Markets, the parent of LeveL. \u201cIt could be a cost, an overhead they don\u2019t necessarily have to take on if we can build it, then scale it\u201d using the existing network, he says. \u201cWe lower the barrier to entry.\u201d At IntelligentCross, the majority of rooms currently offered serve institutional brokers that don\u2019t have capacity to conduct similar activities internally. Jefferies trades in a private room provided by the firm where it interacts with seven other brokers who don\u2019t have their own ATS, but have institutional orders, according to Suryawanshi.\n\n\u201cThese are always created at the request of a subscriber, who is the host that invites others to be guests in their book,\u201d says Ginis at Imperative Execution. Dark disclosure Not every ATS is rushing to embrace private rooms. New York-based PureStream offers \u201cpools\u201d that operate like rooms, but they are disclosed to all subscribers if they are created, and anyone can join. In essence, the room is open to all. Credit: Bloomberg So far no one has asked to set up a pool at PureStream, so there is zero volume in so-called sub-pools, according to CEO Armando Diaz. He says offering a private room that isn\u2019t open to all subscribers raises questions about the regulation. \u201cThe more the host controls the room, the more they are operating an ATS, and that opens up regulatory risk,\u201d he says.\n\nPerhaps the biggest criticism of private rooms is that they create phantom liquidity, because transactions taking place inside a room are simply lumped in with the total activity reported by its dark pool parent. That creates a misleading picture for anyone trying to gauge market depth, since reported trading volumes include activity not available to those outside the room. ATS are regulated trading venues, overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which in 2018 enhanced its supervision of such venues by imposing new disclosure requirements. Each dark pool must now file a form, ATS-N, which gives an overview about the specific trading mechanisms on its platform. These publicly available forms go into various details, including whether private rooms are available. But they don\u2019t say how many exist or who is in them, and the varying language and levels of disclosure used mean it can sometimes be difficult to determine if an ATS is even hosting any rooms. \u2018They are innovative, and here to stay. There is more going on there than most people know.\u2019 Mark Gurliacci, former NYSE employee and now senior vice president and senior quantitative trader at AllianceBernstein \u201cThere are no rules to force ATS to break out the identity of single-dealer rooms or their volume,\u201d Larry Tabb, head of market structure at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a May note. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority \u201cdoes a good job of ATS volume reporting on a post-execution basis. Yet there are no rules to aid analysts or users looking to break down the percentage of ATS volume executed in the open pool vs. the private room, or the volume executed using segmentation strategies,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDark pools are no strangers to transparency worries. Their opacity provoked extensive media coverage and regulatory scrutiny about a decade ago amid speculation they gave high-frequency firms advantages against other investors \u2014 attention partly prompted by the bestselling book Flash Boys. Representatives for both Finra and the SEC declined to comment. \u2018Growth mode\u2019 For their users, private rooms are a handy tool, but still one of a set. Hosted pools represent a single-digit percentage of IntelligentCross\u2019s overall volumes for now \u2014 an average of about 5.4 per cent last year \u2014 because they\u2019re so new, according to Ginis. \u201cIt will take brokers some time to optimise for this,\u201d he says. CEO of OneChronos Capital Markets Vlad Khandros says its rooms represent less than 5 per cent of volume at present as \u201cit\u2019s newer for us, so it\u2019s still in growth mode.\u201d But demand is strong. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen increased interest from both retail and institutional brokers,\u201d Khandros says. \u201cThe focus on execution quality will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nLoading LeveL declined to disclose the number of rooms it operates or how much activity takes place in them, with Miele saying the absence of industry-wide criteria for categorising rooms means it could be \u201cmisleading to quantify.\u201d Mark Gurliacci, senior vice president and senior quantitative trader at AllianceBernstein, reckons up to 75 per cent of the firm\u2019s activity is now happening off-exchange, including in private rooms. While the latter is a small slice of their trading at present, he thinks it\u2019s set to grow. \u201cMany firms are setting up private rooms these days,\u201d says Gurliacci, who used to work for the NYSE. \u201cThey are innovative, and here to stay. There is more going on there than most people know.\u201d Bloomberg",

        "text": "Pop quiz: What's the name of the world's most famous trio? If you're a foodie, then your answer might have been breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's an almost universally accepted trinity \u2014 particularly in the Western world.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how did it come about?\n\n\n\nThe first meals\n\nEarly humans were nomadic. Forming small communities, they would travel with the seasons, following local food sources.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile we can only guess what daily mealtimes rhythms looked like, evidence dating back 30,000 years from the South Moravia region, Czech Republic, shows people visited specific settlements time and again.\n\n\n\nThe fertile crescent covers the rich, biodiverse valleys of the Tigris, Euphrates and Jordan rivers. Source: Shutterstock / The Conversation They gathered around hearths, cooking and sharing food: the first signs of human \"commensality\", the practice of eating together.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the best-preserved hunter-gatherer sites we've found is located on the shores of the modern-day Sea of Galilee (also called Lake Tiberias or Lake Kinneret) in Israel, and it dates back some 23,000 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to several small dwellings with hearths, it provides evidence of diverse food sources, including more than 140 types of seeds and nuts, and various birds, fish and mammals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe development of agricultural knowledge some 12,000 years ago gave rise to permanent settlements. The earliest were in the Levant region (across modern-day Iraq, south-western Iran and eastern T\u00fcrkiye), in an area called the Fertile Crescent.\n\n\n\n\n\nPermanent agriculture led to the production of a surplus of food. The ability to stay in one place with food on hand meant the time it took to cook no longer mattered as much.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt quickly became common to eat one light meal early in the day, followed by a larger hearth-prepared meal later on. The specific timings would have varied between groups.\n\n\n\nEating together as a rule\n\nThe communal nature of foraging and hunting, and later farming, meant humans almost always ate their meals in the company of others.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the ancient city-state of Sparta, in the fourth century BCE, these practices were codified as common main meals called syssitia (eating together).\n\n\n\n\n\nThese meals were consumed at the end of the day in communal dining halls. Food was served by young boys to tables of 15 or so men who lived together and fought in the same military division.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe men gradually shared generational knowledge with the young boys, who themselves would join the tables by age 20.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fifth century BCE, Greek historian Herodotus wrote about how syssitia evolved from a Spartan military practice to having deep political meaning in society.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Plato wrote common meals were an integral component of civil society and that missing a meal without good reason was a civic offence.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy dining in with the rest of society, citizens were compelled to maintain self-discipline. Mealtime was also an opportunity for social linkage and important discussions ranging from business deals to politics.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe eating habits of Spartan women are missing in the texts, although it is implied they ate at home.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Sharing a meal really can make us happier people\n\nBunches of lunches\n\nCounter to the tough Spartan way of life, the Romans enjoyed their main meal earlier in the day, followed by a lighter meal just before bed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe northern European tribes tended towards two larger meals per day, as more sustenance is required in colder climes. To the Vikings, these meals were known as dagmal and nattmal, or day meal and night meal.\n\n\n\n\n\nNattmal was the cooked evening meal, while dagmal usually consisted of leftover nattmal with the addition of bread and beer or mead.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE This Chinese restaurant will tell our Indigenous and Asian history through food\n\nIn Australia, evidence suggests Aboriginal peoples tended toward a daily single meal, which aligns with the predominant method of cookery: slow-cooking with hot coals or rocks in an earth oven.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis underground oven, used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, was referred to as a kup murri or kap mauri by some groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is similar to other Indigenous preparations throughout the Pacific, such as the New Zealand M\u0101ori h\u0101ng\u012b, Hawaiian imu, Fijian lovo, and even the Mayan p\u00edib.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe once-daily meal would have been supplemented with snacks throughout the day.\n\n\n\nThree's the magic number\n\nThe timing of meals was heavily influenced by class structure, local climate and people's daily activities. Practicality also played a part.\n\n\n\n\n\nWithout reliable lighting, meals had to be prepared and eaten before dark. In settled parts of northern Europe, this could be as early as 3pm.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how did we go from one or two main meals to three? The answer may lie with the British Royal Navy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince its inception in the 16th century, the navy has served three regular meals to align with the shipboard routine. This included a simple breakfast of ship's biscuits, lunch as the main meal, and dinner as more of a light supper.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome sources suggest the term square meal may have come from the square wooden trays meals were served in.\n\n\n\nInitially, sailors received a gallon of beer with meals daily. This was later changed to watered-down rum, the infamous \"grog\" which is being handed out in this 1940 photo taken aboard HMS King George V. Credit: Imperial War Museums The Industrial Revolution, which started around 1760, arguably also played a role in formalising the concept of three specific mealtimes across the Western world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cadence of breakfast, lunch and dinner matched the routine of the longer, standardised workdays. Workers ate breakfast and dinner at home, before and after work, while lunch was eaten with coworkers at a set time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith minimal breaks and no time for snacking, three substantial meals became necessary.\n\n\n\nThe fall of the holy trinity\n\nToday, many factors impact the time and frequency of our meals, from long work commutes to juggling hobbies and social obligations.\n\n\n\nThe ways in which we eat and share food continue to evolve alongside our societies and cultures. Source: Shutterstock / The Conversation The COVID-19 pandemic also impacted how and what we eat, leading us to eat larger amounts of higher-calorie foods. The rapid growth of delivery services also means a meal is no more than a few minutes away from most people.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of this has resulted in mealtimes becoming less rigid, with social meals such as brunch, elevenses and afternoon teas expanding how we connect over food. And mealtimes will continue to evolve as our schedules become ever more complicated.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Key Points Donald Trump has announced a 90-day pause on most country-specific tariffs.\n\nTrump said he would raise the tariff on Chinese imports to 125 per cent.\n\nUS treasury secretary Scott Bessent said \"this was his strategy all along\".\n\nIn a stunning reversal, United States President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would temporarily lower new tariffs on many countries, even as he raised them further on imports from China.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's turnabout, which came less than 24 hours after steep new tariffs kicked in on most trading partners, followed the most intense episode of financial market volatility since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The upheaval erased trillions of dollars from stock markets and led to an unsettling surge in US government bond yields that appeared to catch Trump's attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I saw last night that people were getting a little queasy,\" Trump told reporters following his announcement. \"The bond market right now is beautiful.\"\n\n\n\nTrump said he would raise the tariff on Chinese imports to 125 per cent from the 104 per cent level that took effect at midnight, further escalating a high-stakes confrontation between the world's two largest economies.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the latest twist, Trump said he would suspend targeted tariffs on other countries for three months to allow time for US officials to negotiate with countries that have sought to reduce them.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's reversal on the country-specific tariffs is not absolute. A 10 per cent blanket duty on almost all US imports will remain in effect, the White House said. The announcement also does not appear to affect duties on autos, steel and aluminum that are already in place.\n\n\n\nWall Street soars on tariff pause\n\nUS stock indexes shot higher on the news, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging 7.9 per cent to 40,608.45 and the broad-based S&P 500 Index rallying 9.5 per cent to 5,456.90.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 12.2 per cent to 17,124.97.\n\n\n\n\n\nArt Hogan, managing director of stock picking firm B. Riley Financial, said: \"When markets are pricing in worst-case scenarios, it doesn't take much good news to turn that opinion around.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said investors were waiting for any sign of a more reasonable trade process, adding the situation might \"be less of a drag on economic activity and earnings\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he cautioned that \"China will become hyper-aware of the fact that they're now being isolated in this process\".\n\n\n\n\n\nGoldman Sachs cut its probability for a recession back to 45 per cent after Trump's move, down from 65 per cent, saying the tariffs left in place were still likely to result in a 15 per cent increase in the overall tariff rate.\n\n\n\n'Maximum leverage'\n\nUS treasury secretary Scott Bessent said the administration needed time to negotiate with more than 75 countries that had reached out and suggested Trump had used the tariffs to create \"maximum negotiating leverage for himself\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This was his strategy all along,\" he told reporters at the White House. \"And you might even say that he goaded China into a bad position. They responded. They have shown themselves to the world to be the bad actor.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBessent is the point person in the country-by-country negotiations that could address foreign aid and military cooperation as well as economic matters.\n\n\n\nTrump has spoken with leaders of Japan and South Korea, and a delegation from Vietnam was due to meet with US officials on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump's announcement appeared to surprise US trade representative Jamieson Greer, who was testifying on Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I understand it's 90 days, I haven't spoken to the president,\" he told politicians.\n\n\n\n\n\nSteven Horsford, a Democratic US representative, said: \"It looks like your boss just pulled the rug out from under you and paused the tariffs, the taxes on the American people. There's no strategy.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The past week has featured worldwide economic turmoil. Global share markets have plunged, the Australian dollar is sliding, and fresh tariffs are on the table for every country around the world, courtesy of United States President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prospect of weaker global growth has people jittery \u2014 and central banks, including the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), are back on rate-cut watch.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut what does that mean for Australia's ever-growing housing market?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe asked experts how the latest economic ructions could impact house prices \u2014 and who's most likely to benefit or lose out.\n\n\n\nRate cuts would matter more than tariffs\n\nWhile Trump's tariffs aren't about housing, their ripple effects could eventually touch it, even here in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has imposed a 10 per cent tariff on Australia, while other countries faced even steeper tariffs, with China hit hardest at 104 per cent .\n\n\n\nAlthough tariffs themselves don't directly impact the housing market, they can shape global trade, affect employment, and dampen economic growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can influence how confident Australians feel about making big financial decisions like buying property \u2014 and prompt movement from central banks.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth experts SBS News spoke to agreed that it wasn't the tariffs themselves that would impact housing, it's how governments and central banks respond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Generally, when we see an economic shock, like what we seem to be moving into at the moment, the next thing we see is some level of stimulus,\" said Tim Lawless, head of research at property market analysts CoreLogic.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, if global growth falters, interest rate cuts are likely to follow \u2014 and that's where housing starts to react.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If we do see interest rates coming down potentially 50 basis points (0.5 per cent) in May and maybe another 100 basis points (1 per cent) by the end of the year, it may be a positive factor for housing markets,\" Lawless said.\n\n\n\nLower interest rates tend to make mortgages cheaper, boost borrowing capacity and free up cash. That can push more buyers into the market and drive prices higher \u2014 especially when supply is already tight.\n\n\n\n\n\nLawless adds that any interest rate cuts won't meaningfully change housing affordability, but it may boost confidence.\n\n\n\nJobs are the real anchor\n\nFor Dr Luke Hartigan, an economist at the University of Sydney and former adviser at the Reserve Bank, the bigger concern is the labour market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Labour market is the key for house prices,\" he said. \"If you don\u2019t see a substantial deterioration in the labour market, then house prices should be okay.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What the latest inflation data could mean for your interest rate\n\nEven if the global economy takes a hit, Hartigan says, the impact on housing will be limited unless unemployment starts to rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australians are unlikely to just abandon their homes,\" he adds. \"They wear the debt. If you have your job, you keep making repayments.\"\n\n\n\nPrices may keep rising \u2014 but not fast\n\nDespite stock market jitters, neither expert sees a housing crash on the cards. If anything, lowering interest rates could mean prices may rise further, albeit more slowly than before.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Housing [price growth] probably won\u2019t be as steep just because of the increased uncertainty,\" Hartigan said. \"If people are concerned about their job, then they\u2019re more likely to not want to take on debt.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If they\u2019re not likely to take on debt, there\u2019s going to be fewer people who are keen to bid up prices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn short, rate cuts could support the market, but uncertainty might keep buyers cautious \u2014 especially those on the edge of affordability.\n\n\n\nAustralia's property market has already lifted off the back of the Reserve Bank's interest rate cut. Source: SBS News The RBA's February interest rate cut , its first since 2020, has coincided with a lift in the housing market.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to CoreLogic's latest Hedonic Home Value Index report, Australian property values reached new heights in March with an increase of 0.4 per cent, reversing a recent downward trend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're seeing some changing gears in the housing market,\" Lawless explained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"From October last year, we started to see our home value index really flatten out \u2026 then as of February, the market started to bounce back a little bit on the back of the February cash rate cut back to near record highs by the time we saw March data come through.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, due to factors like housing affordability and high household debt, Lawless doesn't expect a strong rebound in prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact that house affordability is quite stretched will naturally just keep a bit of a ceiling on how high prices can go.\"\n\n\n\nWho wins and who loses?\n\nPut simply, those who already own homes are likely to benefit \u2014 again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If you already own a home and we start to see housing prices rising again, that\u2019s a great thing for household wealth,\" Lawless said. \"But for those looking to get into the marketplace, affordability becomes even more stretched.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHartigan agrees. \"It\u2019s probably going to be the people who already own homes, or people who are looking to just get in now and they have the cash.\"\n\n\n\nFirst-home buyers, on the other hand, could be squeezed out yet again \u2014 especially if they've put their savings into riskier investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If house prices start to rise, it\u2019s probably not going to be very good for first-home buyers, depending on how people have put their deposits,\" Hartigan said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Maybe many of them, like myself, have put them into a managed fund \u2014 and now it\u2019s worth less.\"\n\n\n\n",

These people aren\u2019t billionaires or wealthy property investors, it\u2019s not their fault the system is so broken and they make up more than two thirds of people who use negative gearing. We will protect existing Mum and Dad investors by grandfathering negative gearing and capital gains tax for people with one investment property. That remains for them forever.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton says the Coalition will reduce net migration to Australia by 100,000 if they are elected.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate net migration dropped to 379,000 in the year to last September and is forecast to fall further.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Labor government has pledged to further reduce overseas net migration, which has been declining from post-COVID highs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Mr Dutton says the government is not doing enough to meet its own migration targets and it is hurting Australians.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" People who started with nothing and amassed a fortune or people who have come here as builders and bricklayers and the rest of it, we are a net beneficiary about but I think the concentration at the moment is on how canal migration program work best for us? It doesn't work best for us when you see an escalation in numbers to a record high. This whole big Australia policy that has led to Anthony Albanese 's housing crisis and the reason young Australians can't get into housing is because of the decisions the prime has made.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother 3,000 doctors have walked off the job to take part in the second day of industrial action in New South Wales, demanding higher wages and safer working conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe doctors' union maintains that emergency departments and critical care have not been compromised by the three-day strike.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut New South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park says the walkout has forced the cancellation of more than 600 elective surgeries and 4000 outpatient appointments since yesterday [[Tues]] morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctors are demanding pay parity with other states and guaranteed 10 hour breaks between shifts.\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan Park says the state government is trying to address the discrepancy in wages but it will take time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No one is hiding under a rock and pretending that we\u2019re not aware of discrepancies. But trying to make up 12 years of wage suppression in 12 months is also not feasible and I want doctors to understand that.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn football,\n\n\n\n\n\nDeclan Rice's two fantastic freekicks helped Arsenal to an emphatic 3-0 victory over Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final.\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite a number of heroic saves from Real Madrid's goalkeeper Thibault Courtois there was no stopping Rice's stunning opener in the 58th minute - the midfielder's first senior goal from a direct freekick.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Rice's second freekick was even better than the first, curled straight into the top corner in the 70th minute, to leave the 15-time European champions looking stunned.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd a striker's finish from Mikel Merino gave Arsenal their third goal.\n\n\n\n\n\nArsenal Manager Mikel Arteta says he was amazed by Declan Rice's goals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTo score two goals in 12 minutes of that magnitude and that quality from the same player, a player who has never scored from a free kick before in his career, I mean, what are the odds? But he's done it tonight. I'm a big believer. I think the crowd played something with the energy that they put in and it helped us massively to win the game.\u201d\n\n\n\n",

There's a lot of uncertainty in the global economy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States is imposing a 104 per cent tariff on China from tonight after the Chinese government refused to lift its retaliatory tariffs on U-S goods by the Tuesday deadline set by President Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has confirmed the decision in a news briefing.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Leavitt says President Trump believes China has to make a deal with the U-S, and went on to say he would be incredibly gracious but is going to do what's best for the American people.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has described conditions in Gaza since the collapse of the ceasefire in March as re-opening the floodgates of horror.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo aid has been delivered to the Palestinian enclave of some 2.1 million people since March 2nd.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael has said it won't allow the entry of any goods and supplies into Gaza until Hamas releases all the remaining hostages.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Guterres says the impact of Israel's actions have resulted in suffering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"More than an entire month has passed without a drop of aid into Gaza - no food, no fuel, no medicine, no commercial supplies. As aid has dried up, the floodgates of horror have reopened. Gaza is a killing field, and civilians are in an endless death loop.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heads of six UN agencies have appealed to world leaders to act urgently to ensure food and supplies reach Palestinians there.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 58 people are confirmed dead after the collapse of the roof of a nightclub in the Dominican Republic capital on Monday [[7/4]].\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials said 146 people were injured and emergency crews are still working to pull survivors from the rubble as families of the victims gathered at the site searching for their loved ones.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disaster struck during a concert attended by politicians, athletes and other prominent figures, while the cause of the collapse remains under investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn athletics, a 57-year-old record held by Olympic great Raelene Boyle has been broken by 17-year-old Leah O'Brien.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe recorded 11.14 seconds in the 100-metre event at the Australian Junior Athletics Championships in her home city of Perth [[on Tuesday 9 April]].\n\n\n\n\n\nThat time has beaten the national under-18 record set by Boyle in her Olympic debut at the 1968 Mexico Games.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe achieved a time of 11.20 seconds.\n\n\n\n",

You'll recall at the last election, Anthony Albanese promised $275 off power bills. Well, that never came to pass.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Minister for Housing Clare O'Neil says there are significant flaws in the Coalition's policy, criticising what she describes as the Opposition's lack of commitment to the government's cost of living relief measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've been waiting months for the coalition to bring forward detail on what they promised would be meaningful cost of living support for Australian households on energy, and we wake up this morning to find that they're talking about maybe a $60 a year reduction on energy bills for people in two years time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese did not confirm whether his party would consider a deal with the Greens on rental caps and negative gearing, but insists his government is looking to win a majority at the election.\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens leader Adam Bandt is set to reiterate calls to scrap negative gearing and discounts to capital gains taxes for investors, as well as put a freeze on rent, at National Press Club today [[9/4]].\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the opening of Hay St Market at Sydney's renowned Paddy Markets, Mr Albanese says the Greens are looking for media attention.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We been, there's nothing new about the greens talking themselves up, because sometimes the media follow that up for whatever reason. It makes things a bit more interesting. But the truth is that our objective is to hold onto the 78 seats that we currently hold and build on it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation Minister Jason Clare ruled out supporting the Greens policy to scrap negative gearing and discounts to capital gains taxes for housing investors on Sky News today.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers is meeting with heads of the central bank and the banking, business and consumer regulators to construct a plan to mitigate the economic damage caused by tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comes as a US Democratic Senator condemned President Donald Trump's decision to impose a baseline 10 per cent tariff on Australian goods.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fiery exchange between Mark Warner and US trade representative Jamieson Greer took place during a US Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Greer responded to Mr Warner's question about why Australia was hit with a 10 per cent tariff before the Democratic Senator interrupted his reply.\n\n\n\n\n\nGREER: \"Senator, Australia has the lowest rate available under the new program. They -\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWARNER: \"We already have a free trade agreement, we have a trade surplus. So getting the least bad - why did they get whacked in the first place?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 58 people are confirmed dead after the collapse of the roof of a nightclub in the Dominican Republic capital on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficials said 146 people were injured and emergency crews are still working to pull survivors from the rubble as families of the victims gathered at the site searching for their loved ones.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe disaster struck during a concert attended by politicians, athletes and other prominent figures, while the cause of the collapse remains under investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korean state media reports the country's status as a nuclear weapons state can never be reversed, despite the demands of the United States and its Asian allies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe comments on Wednesday were likely a response to a joint statement by the foreign ministers of South Korea, Japan and the US made on the sidelines of a NATO meeting last week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three foreign ministers in a joint statement reaffirmed the \"commitment to the complete denuclearisation\" of North Korea.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Kim Yo-jong, says the position of North Korea's nuclear weapons state is a result of outside hostile threats, with not changes to planned.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Korea has pursued nuclear weapons despite sanctions by the United Nations Security Council since it first conducted an underground nuclear detonation test in 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in sport,\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby Australia has confirmed the renewal of its landmark broadcast partnership with Nine through to 2030.\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby Australia said the new deal spanning 2026-2030, valued at up to $240 million, represents a significant uplift on their current broadcast agreement and follows a successful organisational reset in 2024.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\u201cI have authorised a 90-day PAUSE,\u201d Trump said in his post on his social platform Truth Social, after recognising the more than 75 countries that he said had been negotiating on trade and had not retaliated against his latest increases in tariffs. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later told reporters that Trump was pausing his so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on most of the country\u2019s biggest trading partners, but maintaining his 10 per cent tariff on nearly all global imports, including those from Australia. \u2018As welcome as the announcement was, investors can\u2019t assume it\u2019s the end of the tariff story, or that the market\u2019s day-to-day volatility will disappear.\u2019 Daniel Skelly, Morgan Stanley It was a starkly different story for China though, though, with Trump saying tariffs were going up to 125 per cent against its products. That raises the possibility of more swings ahead that could stun financial markets. The trade war is not over, and an escalating battle between the world\u2019s two largest economies can create plenty of damage. US stocks are also still below where they were just a week ago, when Trump announced worldwide tariffs in what he called \u201cLiberation Day\u201d. But overnight, at least, the focus on Wall Street was on the positive.\n\n\u201cThe tariff clouds parted for the first time today,\u201d said Daniel Skelly, head of the wealth management market research and strategy team at Morgan Stanley. \u201cBut it\u2019s too soon to know how sunny the skies will be tomorrow \u2013 or 90 days from now \u2026 As welcome as the announcement was, investors can\u2019t assume it\u2019s the end of the tariff story, or that the market\u2019s day-to-day volatility will disappear.\u201d Huge swings have become routine for financial markets worldwide recently, not just day to day but hour to hour, as investors struggle to game out what Trump\u2019s trade war will do to the economy. Credit: AP The relief came after doubts had crept in about whether Trump cared about the financial pain the US stock market was taking because of his tariffs. The S&P 500, which sits at the centre of many pension fund accounts, came into the day nearly 19 per cent below its record set less than two months ago. That surprised many professional investors, who had long thought that a president who used to crow about records for the Dow under his watch would pull back on policies if they sent markets reeling.\n\nWednesday\u2019s rally pulled the S&P 500 index away from the edge of what\u2019s called a \u201cbear market\u201d. That\u2019s what professionals call it when a run-of-the-mill drop of 10 per cent for US stocks, which happens every year or so, graduates into a more vicious fall of 20 per cent. The index is now down 11.2 per cent from its record. Loading Wall Street also got a boost from a relatively smooth auction of US Treasurys in the bond market on Wednesday. Earlier jumps in Treasury yields had rattled the market, indicating increasing levels of stress. Trump himself said on Wednesday that he had been watching the bond market \u201cgetting a little queasy\u201d. Analysts say several reasons could be behind the rise in yields, including hedge funds and other investors having to sell their Treasury bonds to raise cash to make up for losses in the stock market. Investors outside the United States may also be selling their US Treasurys because of the trade war. Such actions would push down prices for Treasurys, which in turn would push up their yields. Regardless of the reasons behind it, higher yields on Treasurys add pressure on the sharemarket and push upwards on rates for mortgages and other loans for US households and businesses.\n\nThe moves are particularly notable because US Treasury yields have historically dropped \u2013 not risen \u2013 during scary times for the market because the bonds are usually seen as some of the safest possible investments. This week\u2019s sharp rise had brought the yield on the 10-year Treasury back to where it was in late February. Loading After approaching 4.5 per cent in the morning, the 10-year yield pulled back to 4.34 per cent following Trump\u2019s pause and the Treasury\u2019s auction. That\u2019s still up from 4.26 per cent late on Tuesday and from just 4.01 per cent at the end of last week. Of course, the trade war is not over. Bessent and Trump clearly showed their anger at China, which has been ratcheting up its own tariffs on US goods and announcing other countermeasures with each move Trump has made. China said earlier it would raise tariffs on US goods to 84 per cent on Thursday. \u201cIf the US insists on further escalating its economic and trade restrictions, China has the firm will and abundant means to take necessary countermeasures and fight to the end\u201d the Ministry of Commerce said.\n\nLater the US Treasury secretary said in a message to countries worldwide, but perhaps most directly aimed at China: \u201cDo not retaliate, and you will be rewarded.\u201d On Wall Street, the gains were widespread across the US sharemarket, and 98 per cent of the stocks in the S&P 500 index rallied. Leading the way were airlines and other stocks that need customers feeling confident enough to travel for work or for vacation. Delta Air Lines soared 23.4 per cent. Earlier in the day, it had pulled financial forecasts for 2025 as the trade war scrambles expectations for business and household spending and depresses bookings across the travel sector. In other international markets, indexes tumbled across most of Europe and much of Asia after they closed before Trump\u2019s announcement. London\u2019s FTSE 100 dropped 2.9 per cent, Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 sank 3.9 per cent and the CAC 40 fell 3.3 per cent in Paris. Chinese stocks were an outlier, and indexes rose 0.7 per cent in Hong Kong and 1.3 per cent in Shanghai.",

        "text": "Last month, CBD revealed that mining giant Rio Tinto was bankrolling the Mabo Centre at the University of Melbourne, an initiative to support traditional owners and First Nations youth that is named after renowned Indigenous land rights campaigner Eddie Mabo, whose High Court case ended the doctrine of terra nullius.\n\nA 1990 photo of Eddie Mabo. Credit: Jim McEwan\n\nFor the company, funding the centre is the next step in a campaign to repair its relationship with First Nations Australians, which was tainted by its destruction of 46,000-year-old Indigenous rock shelters at Juukan Gorge in 2020. The incident brought Rio worldwide opprobrium and led to the resignation of its chief executive, Jean-S\u00e9bastien Jacques.\n\nDespite efforts to buy back goodwill with Indigenous communities \u2013 the company donated millions to the Yes campaign in the 2023 Voice referendum \u2013 not everyone has forgotten Rio\u2019s recent past. This week, six of Mabo\u2019s grandchildren signed a scathing statement condemning the company\u2019s backing of the Mabo Centre, which the statement accuses of betraying the late Eddie Mabo\u2019s vision.\n\n\u201cWe are mortified that the Mabo name is tied to something so hypocritical,\u201d says the statement, written by artist Neta-Rie Mabo, and co-signed by her cousins Mahalia, Maria, Hannah, Cathryn and Peta.\n\n\u201cWe cannot reconcile our family\u2019s name being tied to a centre funded by the very forces our grandfather fought against. A centre in his name now accepts money from Rio Tinto, a corporation that has desecrated sacred sites and disregarded Indigenous sovereignty. He would be appalled.\u201d\n\nThe statement exposes a division among Mabo\u2019s descendants. His daughter Gail Mabo and grandson Kaleb Mabo both attended the centre\u2019s launch. Gail, a prominent artist, was also featured in an article in The Australian about the centre.\n\nThe six Mabo grandchildren who signed the statement want the centre to cut all ties with Rio Tinto.\n\n\u201cAnything less is a betrayal. Our grandfather\u2019s name deserves better. His legacy is not for sale,\u201d they say.\n\nThe centre\u2019s advisory board issued a statement on Wednesday night saying it was aware of the criticisms but noting the centre\u2019s name was \u201cgifted by senior members of the Mabo family following extensive engagement with them\u201d.\n\nIt said those senior family members were aware of the Rio Tinto investment before deciding whether to gift the name and added that the money did not come with a governance role for the mining giant at the centre. The company declined to comment.",

        "text": "\u201cIt\u2019s about exercising control, what liquidity a broker wants to interact with to achieve better execution quality,\u201d says Roman Ginis, CEO of Imperative Execution, the parent company of IntelligentCross. There are myriad reasons why users may opt for private rooms. Take the case of CastleOak Securities, a New York-based minority-run brokerage. The firm wants to trade with similarly minded businesses, so it uses a private room provided by the ATS operator OneChronos. Credit: Bloomberg Intelligence Carlos Cabana, head of equity sales and trading at CastleOak, dubs the room a \u201cdiversity pool,\u201d because the participants are all minority-operated brokerage firms. While in this instance CastleOak doesn\u2019t know specifically who is on the other side of every trade, it knows it will be one of about 10 counterparties who meet certain eligibility criteria related to ownership and investment goals. \u201cThink of it as an apartment that\u2019s hosting a party, and there\u2019s one purpose for the party with only invited guests,\u201d says Cabana.\n\nThanks to CastleOak\u2019s increasing use of the diversity pool, OneChronos is now its third most-used trading venue, behind only the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, Cabana says. Execution excellence Private rooms are known by a slew of other names including hosted pools, restricted-access rooms, ATS pools, and custom counterparty groups. They\u2019re gaining popularity in the huge, ultra-fast modern market as a way to help firms avoid losing out against players who may be able to move quicker or who have access to superior information. Dark pools are so-called because the trades they handle happen away from the \u201clit\u201d public exchange. Credit: Bloomberg For instance, many brokers and market makers are keen to take the other side of retail investor orders. Those small, less volatile trades are generally unlikely to impact prices \u2014 so a market maker won\u2019t see an adverse move occur the instant it agrees to fill an order, as might happen with another type of counterparty.\n\nBrokers who take orders to private rooms typically expect to fill the order at the midpoint of the national-best-bid and offer, or NBBO (assuming the rule of the room is set up that way, which is usually the case). If for some reason the order is not filled in the room at the midpoint, it can move to the broader ATS where multiple other parties can compete to fill it. And if a broker has bad experiences with a private room, they can change to another in the future, avoiding those counterparties. \u201cThe problem we have is, how do we identify good versus bad liquidity?\u201d says Jatin Suryawanshi, global head of quant strategy at Jefferies, who estimates that 15 in every 100 shares executed by the firm\u2019s algorithms currently move via a room. \u201cIn using private rooms, you can prioritize who you want to interact with.\u201d The growth of private rooms has accelerated as their use has become more common and as stock trading has migrated away from public exchanges. Off-exchange activity has been rising for years in the US, and now frequently accounts for more than half of all recorded volume. Private rooms emerged at the ATS firm LeveL as far back as 18 years ago. LeveL started by allowing firms to match their own orders, in what\u2019s known as internalization. That expanded to other forms of segmentation, including bi-lateral and multi-lateral agreements, where one party agrees to trade with another, or multiple parties agree to only interact with each other, within the same ATS. Following requests from its own clients, IntelligentCross started offering its version of private rooms about a year-and-a-half ago, and OneChronos joined the party last year.\n\nPrivate rooms are not generally needed by big banks or brokers who have the resources to create their own ATS or what are called single-dealer platforms. That\u2019s another breed of off-exchange trading venue where the operator is always the counterparty to any trade. But for smaller players, it\u2019s too expensive and cumbersome to build and manage an ATS or SDP, meet the associated regulatory reporting requirements and set up the necessary connections. Arranging a private room at an established ATS is a solution. Loading \u201cThere are various factors of why a firm would want to outsource this activity than keep it in house,\u201d says Steve Miele, CEO of Kezar Markets, the parent of LeveL. \u201cIt could be a cost, an overhead they don\u2019t necessarily have to take on if we can build it, then scale it\u201d using the existing network, he says. \u201cWe lower the barrier to entry.\u201d At IntelligentCross, the majority of rooms currently offered serve institutional brokers that don\u2019t have capacity to conduct similar activities internally. Jefferies trades in a private room provided by the firm where it interacts with seven other brokers who don\u2019t have their own ATS, but have institutional orders, according to Suryawanshi.\n\n\u201cThese are always created at the request of a subscriber, who is the host that invites others to be guests in their book,\u201d says Ginis at Imperative Execution. Dark disclosure Not every ATS is rushing to embrace private rooms. New York-based PureStream offers \u201cpools\u201d that operate like rooms, but they are disclosed to all subscribers if they are created, and anyone can join. In essence, the room is open to all. Credit: Bloomberg So far no one has asked to set up a pool at PureStream, so there is zero volume in so-called sub-pools, according to CEO Armando Diaz. He says offering a private room that isn\u2019t open to all subscribers raises questions about the regulation. \u201cThe more the host controls the room, the more they are operating an ATS, and that opens up regulatory risk,\u201d he says.\n\nPerhaps the biggest criticism of private rooms is that they create phantom liquidity, because transactions taking place inside a room are simply lumped in with the total activity reported by its dark pool parent. That creates a misleading picture for anyone trying to gauge market depth, since reported trading volumes include activity not available to those outside the room. ATS are regulated trading venues, overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which in 2018 enhanced its supervision of such venues by imposing new disclosure requirements. Each dark pool must now file a form, ATS-N, which gives an overview about the specific trading mechanisms on its platform. These publicly available forms go into various details, including whether private rooms are available. But they don\u2019t say how many exist or who is in them, and the varying language and levels of disclosure used mean it can sometimes be difficult to determine if an ATS is even hosting any rooms. \u2018They are innovative, and here to stay. There is more going on there than most people know.\u2019 Mark Gurliacci, former NYSE employee and now senior vice president and senior quantitative trader at AllianceBernstein \u201cThere are no rules to force ATS to break out the identity of single-dealer rooms or their volume,\u201d Larry Tabb, head of market structure at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a May note. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority \u201cdoes a good job of ATS volume reporting on a post-execution basis. Yet there are no rules to aid analysts or users looking to break down the percentage of ATS volume executed in the open pool vs. the private room, or the volume executed using segmentation strategies,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDark pools are no strangers to transparency worries. Their opacity provoked extensive media coverage and regulatory scrutiny about a decade ago amid speculation they gave high-frequency firms advantages against other investors \u2014 attention partly prompted by the bestselling book Flash Boys. Representatives for both Finra and the SEC declined to comment. \u2018Growth mode\u2019 For their users, private rooms are a handy tool, but still one of a set. Hosted pools represent a single-digit percentage of IntelligentCross\u2019s overall volumes for now \u2014 an average of about 5.4 per cent last year \u2014 because they\u2019re so new, according to Ginis. \u201cIt will take brokers some time to optimise for this,\u201d he says. CEO of OneChronos Capital Markets Vlad Khandros says its rooms represent less than 5 per cent of volume at present as \u201cit\u2019s newer for us, so it\u2019s still in growth mode.\u201d But demand is strong. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen increased interest from both retail and institutional brokers,\u201d Khandros says. \u201cThe focus on execution quality will continue to grow.\u201d\n\nLoading LeveL declined to disclose the number of rooms it operates or how much activity takes place in them, with Miele saying the absence of industry-wide criteria for categorising rooms means it could be \u201cmisleading to quantify.\u201d Mark Gurliacci, senior vice president and senior quantitative trader at AllianceBernstein, reckons up to 75 per cent of the firm\u2019s activity is now happening off-exchange, including in private rooms. While the latter is a small slice of their trading at present, he thinks it\u2019s set to grow. \u201cMany firms are setting up private rooms these days,\u201d says Gurliacci, who used to work for the NYSE. \u201cThey are innovative, and here to stay.

Donald Trump has paused tariffs on the majority of countries targeted on 'Liberation Day', however he has ramped up his trade war with China with neither country showing any sign of backing down.\n\nAirAsia is bringing more Bali flights to Australian customers, with the addition of a Denpasar-Adelaide flight.

And it's a polite no from Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles. \"I don't think we'll be holding China's hand,\" he said, the ABC reported. \"We obviously don't want to see a trade war between China and the US \u2026 [but] it's about pursuing Australia's national interests, not about making common calls with China.\" Dollar bounces back \u2013 for now The Australian sharemarket has burst out of the gates on Thursday, as US President Donald Trump pauses the bulk of his sweeping tariffs.

The futures markets had predicted it would rise 6 per cent during the day for the biggest daily gain since March 2020. Overnight the Australian dollar also spiked back above 61 US cents. On Wednesday US time, Mr Trump announced he would lower his \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on every country except China, Canada and Mexico to 10 per cent for 90 days. Tariffs on Chinese products would be raised to 125 per cent immediately, he said.

Surveying 1,000 Australians, they found that 54.5 per cent of people would refuse to give up coffee. That's higher than 35.2 per cent of people who wouldn't give up alcohol if asked. It seems men are more reliant on alcohol however, with 42.1 per cent of men refusing to while just 28.5 per cent of women saying they wouldn't.

Trump said he would suspend targeted tariffs for three months to allow time for US officials to negotiate with countries that have sought to reduce them after the removal of trillions of dollars from stock markets triggered panic around the world. China, however, has not been as lucky. Trump is refusing to back down from his trade war with Beijing, which itself has hit back with retaliatory levies. Only time will tell just how far this escalates. Currently, Trump has imposed 125 per cent tariffs on China, while the US is facing 84 per cent tariffs from their counterpart.

That's why they've moved to add further flights to Denpasar from Australia, with Adelaide handed four outbound flights to Bali to ease the \"pent-up demand\" in South Australia. \"We are thrilled to touch down in Adelaide and South Australia soon for the very first time. Australia is one of our most important growth markets with the recent addition of Cairns and Darwin to our network as well as Perth,\" CEO Indonesia AirAsia Veranita Yosephine said.

        "text": "The movement is growing nationwide as Aussies face soaring living costs, with high grocery prices and rents driving some to seek alternative ways to cope.\n\nDumpster divers across Australia have been issued a stern warning to strictly stick to what's allowed under the law or risk landing in serious hot water.\n\nThe trend has been gaining momentum nationwide as Australians grapple with soaring living costs, pushing some to search for alternative ways to get by.\n\nThe process involves sorting through garbage in bins outside of supermarkets and shopping centres to find products that have been discarded, but are still edible or usable. Whether it be fruit and vegetables, tinned goods, or even homewares, an increasing number of Australians swear by the contentious tactic. A growing online community post their pilfered produce and reclaimed goods, while sharing hotspots of where large bins remain unlocked.\n\nLast year, a Sydney dumpster diver claimed it had been years since she'd paid for groceries. Similarly, an Adelaide man said up to \"80 per cent\" of his food is found in bins around South Australia. \"All I buy is my soy milk and bananas once a week,\" he told Yahoo News, while everything else comes from the bins of major retailers and food businesses.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOne local in Lismore, NSW, conducts \"workshops\" showing others how to find the \"insane amount of perfectly good food that is thrown away\". \"You can save hundreds of dollars from one dumpster dive,\" he previously told Yahoo.\n\nIn previous years, Brendan has found major boxes of Easter chocolates. Source: BIG B ADVENTURE/YouTube\n\nDumpster diver's incredible haul as warning issued\n\nDumpster diver Brendan, who proudly shares his exploits on his YouTube channel, told 9News this week he'd found camping equipment, brand new fishing rods, homewares, pots and pans, watches and clothing that had \"never been used, with minimal damage\". He once found a giant haul of seemingly undamaged Easter chocolates as retailers discarded them after the holiday sales \u2013 something many divers will likely be on the lookout for at the end of the month.\n\nHowever, a fresh warning has been issued to 'skip scavengers', reminding them that while rummaging through bins isn\u2019t always illegal, the law does draw a clear line \u2014 only items that have been genuinely discarded can be snatched up. \"If you've taken an item that's not been genuinely abandoned, you could face serious charges, such as stealing,\" lawyer William Kennedy told Nine.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCrucially, it is illegal to remove goods from areas like behind-store loading docks or storage zones if they haven\u2019t been thrown away, even if they appear unwanted. Entering private property, whether it be homes or businesses, without permission can also lead to trespassing charges.\n\nHow can dumpster divers be prosecuted?\n\nAccording to Sydney-based criminal lawyer Avanish Singh, if it's in the bin, it's effectively fair game.\n\n\"If items have been placed in a bin for disposal, then the item will be taken to be 'abandoned' \u2014 this means that someone who takes an item from a bin cannot be charged with stealing as the item is no longer capable of being stolen,\" he explained to Yahoo.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The previous owner has effectively relinquished ownership of it. However, if a person enters onto an enclosed private land \u2014 for example, through a gate or over a fence \u2014 then they are trespassing.\"\n\nWhile some bins may be located in public spaces, many are actually on private property, such as in loading docks, behind locked gates, or in fenced-off areas. In those cases, entering to access the bin could still be considered trespassing, even if the contents of the bin are deemed abandoned and therefore not able to be stolen under the law.\n\nAnother Aussie dumpster diver previously told Yahoo he not only finds food but once found two working smart TVs thrown away. Source: Supplied\n\nA Sydney dumpster diver's previous food haul. Source: Facebook\n\nSo while taking items from a bin itself might not be theft, accessing the bin could still be unlawful if you're on private property without permission. That\u2019s where most dumpster divers run into legal trouble \u2014 not over what's taken, but over where it's taken from.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPutting aside the legal concerns, there may also be several health implications that can arise from dumpster diving. Perishable items like meat, dairy and prepared foods can quickly spoil if not stored properly, leading to a risk of foodborne illnesses such as salmonella. Contamination from mould, pests, or cleaning chemicals is also a possibility, especially if food is mixed with non-edible waste.\n\nInjuries can occur from sharp objects, broken glass or electrical materials, and though many divers take precautions, including the use of gloves and masks, there are definite risks involved.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
