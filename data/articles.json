        "text": "Donald Trump won back the Oval Office and took charge of the government amid the strongest poll numbers of his political career, but as the 100-day mark of his presidency approaches, Americans' views of what he's done so far have turned deeply negative, a new CNN poll has found.\n\nTrump's 41 per cent approval rating is the lowest for any newly elected president at 100 days dating back at least to Dwight Eisenhower \u2013 including Trump's own first term.\n\nApproval of Trump's handling of the presidency is down 4 points since March, and 7 points lower than it was in late February. Just 22 per cent say they strongly approve of Trump's handling of the job, a new low, and about twice as many say they strongly disapprove (45 per cent).\n\nDonald Trump has taken a whack in the latest polling figures, as more Americans appear to grow concerned about his policies. (AP)\n\nSince March, Trump has suffered notable drops in approval from women and Hispanic Americans (down 7 points in each group to 36 per cent among women and 28 per cent among Hispanics).\n\nPartisan views of Trump remain broadly polarised, with 86 per cent of Republicans approving and 93 per cent of Democrats disapproving. But among political independents, the president's approval rating has dipped to 31 per cent, matching his first-term low point with that group and about the same as his standing with them in January 2021.\n\nThe poll finds the president underwater and sinking across nearly all major issues he's sought to address during his time in office, with the public's confidence in his ability to handle those issues also on the decline.\n\nTrump's approval ratings on economic issues have dropped notably since early March as the rollout of his tariff plan led to volatility in the stock market and worries about rising prices.\n\nOn inflation, approval is down 9 points to 35 per cent, and on tariffs themselves, it's down 4 points to 35 per cent. His marks for handling the economy are down 5 points to a career-low of 39 per cent; he hit his previous low once in his first term and again this March).\n\nOnly about half (52 per cent) express confidence in his ability to deal with the economy, down 13 points compared with a December CNN poll.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries leads a sit-in on the steps of the Capitol in Washington, DC. (AP)\n\n\"I'm disappointed. I didn't vote for him. I was going to give him the benefit of doubt, because I figured, you know, he could do things to help the economy and \u2026 further disappointment,\" said a 55-year-old Virginia resident who identifies as an independent and participated in the poll. She has worked for the federal government for more than two decades and asked that her name not be used.\n\nFollowing his far-reaching efforts to reshape the federal government's workforce, Trump has lost ground on approval ratings for managing the federal government (42 per cent approve, down 6 points since March) and only 46 per cent express confidence in him to appoint the best people to office, down 8 points since December. Less than half (43 per cent) see Trump's actions as a necessary shake-up in Washington, while most (57 per cent) say his approach to the presidency is unnecessarily putting the country at risk.\n\nDerek Steinmetz, a Democrat from Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, said he was most concerned by Trump's \"overarching disregard for the rule, and the norms, and the structure of our government. It was a concern the first term, but it's much worse this time around because there are fewer guardrails in place.\"\n\nTrump's moves on foreign affairs \u2013 which have included a more friendly posture toward Russia in its war with Ukraine and ending many foreign aid programs \u2013 are also seeing majority disapproval (39 per cent approve, 60 per cent disapprove). Half say they have a lot or some confidence in his ability to handle foreign affairs, down from 55 per cent before he took office.\n\nEven on immigration, an issue where Trump had outperformed his first-term high by 7 points earlier this year, the poll finds declining approval ratings and diminished confidence in Trump's actions. Overall, 45 per cent approve now, down 6 points from March, and 53 per cent express confidence in his ability to deal with it, down from 60 per cent in December.\n\nTrump earns narrowly positive ratings on only one issue tested in the poll: his handling of issues related to gender identity and trans people. Overall, 51 per cent approve of his handling of that matter, including 90 per cent of Republicans, 48 per cent of independents and 16 per cent of Democrats.\n\nTrump and Zelenskyy met on the sidelines of Pope Francis's funeral. Foreign policy is an area that has seen increased disapproval. (Ukrainian Presidential Press Office)\n\n\"I'm actually quite glad he said that there's only male and female. I was actually quite glad when that came out, when he put that into law, that there's only male and there's only female, that there's no binary, he, she, they. There's no they,\" said Lisa Munson, a Maryland mother-of-three who voted for Trump, when asked what she considers to be Trump's biggest accomplishment.\n\nTrump's efforts at shaping arts, culture and American history, though, are far less popular, with 64 per cent considering it inappropriate for him to take actions like seizing control of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and seeking changes in exhibits at Smithsonian Institution museums, an effort he delegated in part to Vice President JD Vance.\n\nVance matches Trump's 41 per cent job approval rating overall in the poll, with 58 per cent disapproving. Neither Trump nor Vance is viewed favourably by most Americans. Just 40 per cent say they have a favourable view of the president and 34 per cent a favourable view of Vance.\n\nOverall, Americans' confidence in Trump to use the power of the presidency responsibly (46 per cent confident, down 8 points) and to provide real leadership for the country (50 per cent confident, down 9 points) have dropped sharply since December. Trump has issued a slew of executive orders directing changes to government practices and policy that have faced myriad challenges in court.\n\n\"I'm not a big fan of these executive orders that Trump and all the other presidents issue constantly. In Trump's case, I think that he goes overboard on these executive orders, and that's why a lot of them get shot down by the courts, you don't have the authority to do that,\" said George Mastrodonato, a Trump voter and partially retired lawyer who lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico and participated in the poll.\n\n\"I wish he would be a little more discreet and focus on the executive orders that he writes and issues that he could win in court. He seems to be like Yosemite Sam, you know? Blasting off with two guns in both hands, and some of them stick and some of them don't.\"\n\nJust over half of Americans (52 per cent), including majorities of both Democrats and Republicans, say Trump's second presidency will fundamentally change the country in a lasting way. A little more than a third (36 per cent) say any significant changes Trump makes will fade once he leaves office, and only 12 per cent say Trump's second term will not result in significant changes to the country.\n\nCelebrity Trump supporters now turning on the US president View Gallery\n\nStill, Americans are closely split on whether Trump has kept important campaign promises. Just shy of half, 48 per cent, say he's doing a good job of it, 51 per cent a bad job \u2013 numbers that closely mirror this point in his first term. A 55 per cent majority say he's taken at least some actions to effectively address the nation's problems, though only 28 per cent believe he's done things that have already started to help address the country's problems.\n\nMastrodonato, the Trump voter from New Mexico, also largely sees Trump as keeping his promises. \"He's doing what he said he would do. Some of his approaches, I would take a different approach, but, you know, he's Donald Trump so, he's going to do whatever he wants to do.\"",

(AP Photo/Mahdi Nori/Fars News agency)\n\nProvincial Governor Mohammad Ashouri gave the latest death toll, Iranian state TV reported. Pir Hossein Kolivand, head of Iran's Red Crescent society, said that only 190 of about 1000 injured remained hospitalised on Sunday, according to a statement carried by an Iranian government website. The governor declared three days of mourning.\n\nPrivate security firm Ambrey says the port received missile fuel chemical in March.\n\nIt was part of a shipment of ammonium perchlorate from China by two vessels to Iran, first reported in January by the Financial Times .\n\nThe chemical used to make solid propellant for rockets was going to be used to replenish Iran's missile stocks, which had been depleted by its direct attacks on Israel during the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\nSmoke rises in background next to the gutted remains of a truck, Sunday, April 27, 2025, after a massive explosion and fire rocked a port near the southern port city of Bandar Abbas, Iran on Saturday. (AP Photo/Meysam Mirzadeh/Tasnim News)\n\nShip-tracking data analysed by the AP put one of the vessels believed to be carrying the chemical in the vicinity in March, as Ambrey said.\n\n\"The fire was reportedly the result of improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles,\" Ambrey said.\n\nIn a first reaction on Sunday, Iranian Defense Ministry spokesman General Reza Talaeinik denied that missile fuel had been imported through the port.\n\n\"No sort of imported and exporting consignment for fuel or military application was (or) is in the site of the port,\" he told state television by telephone.\n\nIn this photo released by the Iranian Presidency Office, smoke rises in the sky on Sunday, April 27, 2025 after a massive explosion and fire rocked a port near the southern port city of Bandar Abbas, Iran, on Saturday.

(Mahdi Nori/Fars News Agency via AP)\n\nHe called foreign reports on the missile fuel baseless \u2014 but offered no explanation for what material detonated with such incredible force at the site. Talaeinik promised authorities would offer more information later.\n\nIt's unclear why Iran wouldn't have moved the chemicals from the port, particularly after the Beirut port blast in 2020 .\n\nThat explosion, caused by the ignition of hundreds of tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, killed more than 200 people and injured more than 6000 others.\n\nHowever, Israel did target Iranian missile sites where Tehran uses industrial mixers to create solid fuel \u2014 meaning potentially that it had no place to process the chemical.\n\nSocial media footage of the explosion on Saturday at Shahid Rajaei saw reddish-hued smoke rising from the fire just before the detonation.\n\nContainers burn, Sunday, April 27, 2025, after a massive explosion and fire rocked a port near the southern port city of Bandar Abbas, Iran, on Saturday.

(Supplied: Jane Hodgekinson)\n\nMs Hodgekinson said many people also could not afford to take a day out of their schedule to travel out of town for a general check-up.\n\n\"If you can get to the surrounding towns, then they've often closed their books and not taking any new patients, so it's actually a bit of an issue because people put off their regular checks and making health a priority,\" she said.\n\n\"They end up with complex issues and that just compounds again.\"\n\nMs Hodgekinson said she travelled to Brisbane for her medical appointments in order to get consistent care but she was \"fortunate\" she could stay with family overnight, otherwise the trip would be costly.\n\nFive regional seats to watch Photo shows Kristy Alleson There are five contests in regional Australia that could influence the overall result of the federal election. Here's why they matter.\n\nRural Doctors Association of Australia chief executive Peta Rutherford said Yarraman was not the only community facing this \"real challenge\" of accessing medical support.\n\n\"When you're having to travel hundreds of kilometres to access a GP service, a lot of people actually choose to not go and have the service,\" she said.\n\n\"What that means is we often see them present to hospitals with really serious illness but something that could have been prevented and should have been managed in community.\"\n\nRoyal Flying Doctor Service Federation chief executive Emma Buchanan said more than 32,000 people across the country did not have access to a GP within a 60-minute drive.\n\nMore than 100,000 people do not have access to mental health resources.\n\n\"We know that people who live in very remote areas are likely to die 14 years earlier to their urban counterparts and that they're dying from causes that are largely preventable,\" she said.\n\nThe number of bulk billing GPs has dropped over the past five years, especially in rural areas.

(Supplied: Intrapac)\n\nIntrapac chief executive Maxwell Shifman said his vision for Lloyd Creek \"speaks to that local, rural character\".\n\n\"One of the things we're aiming to do here is really deliver some housing typologies and some lot types you haven't seen in the territory for a long time \u2014 really bringing it back to that sort of local, tropical-style housing on a slightly larger lot,\" he said.\n\nThe proposed site of the Lloyd Creek housing development is currently bushland. (ABC News: Sam Parry)\n\nIn 2014, Intrapac Property proposed another development on the same parcel of land \u2014 a precinct called Noonamah Ridge that would have featured 4,200 homes.\n\nThat proposal was rejected by former planning minister Eva Lawler in 2020, following opposition from residents and former local member of parliament Kezia Purick.\n\nMr Shifman said the new plan for Lloyd Creek Rural Village responded to previous community concern about potential impacts on the local rural lifestyle, and now proposed housing connected to town water instead of bores.\n\nNoonamah Ridge was rejected by the former NT Labor government. (Supplied: Intrapac)\n\n\"We've now got the Strauss Water Treatment Plant that's under construction and we'll be able to tap in and deliver potable water to the site, so that takes up one of the key criticisms of the proposal,\" Mr Shifman said.\n\nThe application also said the rural village's proposed land offerings would range from about a quarter-acre up to five acres, with no more than 1.5 dwellings per hectare on most of the site.\n\nDarwin now second-most-expensive capital for renters Photo shows A woman wearing a black t-shirt, standing next to a tall man, orange shirt, straw hat and eye-patch. Standing on front porch. Darwin, Australia's smallest capital city, has been ranked the country's second-most-expensive place to rent a house, along with Canberra.\n\nHowever, in two higher-density sections the proposal refers to as \"rural activity centres\", that number could be as high as 10 dwellings per hectare.\n\nMany residents in the surrounding area live on much larger acreage.\n\nOpposition to development remains\n\nMs Purick said the proposed Lloyd Creek village was the \"wrong kind of development\" for the rural area, and pledged to support other locals as they relaunched their fight against the proposal.\n\n\"They have stock animals, they have farming activities, they have mango orchards and the like, and that comes with certain activities,\" she said.\n\n\"Having small, urbanised blocks right across the road from you will bring a clash of cultures. There's no doubt about it.\n\n\"If Intrapac is so keen to have a presence in the territory, [it should] go and talk to the NT government about developing Weddell, which already has big chunks of major infrastructure in place.\"\n\nKezia Purick says the proposed Lloyd Creek development would clash with existing rural blocks in the area. (ABC News: Hamish Harty)\n\nWeddell \u2014 a proposed satellite city 30 kilometres south of Darwin \u2014 has been flagged as a potential development since 1984.\n\nLabor had plans to establish Weddell while in government in 2009, before the Country Liberal Party shelved the project after taking power in 2012.\n\nIn response, Mr Shifman said his company was not competing with Weddell.\n\n\"It's a very different offering. Weddell would need significant infrastructure upgrades before it's up and running,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not a simple matter of, 'there's land there, develop it'.\"\n\nMax Shifman says the proposal suits Darwin's rural area.

(Supplied: Bryan Van Wyk)\n\nThat is because much of last year's bumper season is sitting in freezers across the country, according to Bryan Van Wyk, who manages Austral Fisheries' northern prawn division.\n\n\"There's still a lot of leftover prawn stock around on the market from previous big years,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got the worst of both worlds \u2026 a market that is reasonably full, which means lower prawn price, and the lowest productive season we've ever seen.\"\n\nCall to consumers\n\nPrawn sales tend to skyrocket twice a year \u2014 Christmas and Australia Day.\n\nBanana prawns are usually flushed into the Gulf of Carpentaria with the first downpour early in the year. (ABC Rural: Abbey Halter)\n\nAs this season's banana prawns hit the shelves, private Carpentaria and Northern Prawn Fishery trawler manager Greg Albert urged people to consider seafood as a protein source when grocery shopping, especially as steak prices had risen.\n\n\"The price of prawns has basically been the same for the last five years in the supermarkets, yet I think it's just the habits of the consumer,\" he said.\n\n\"They're more economical than some of the other proteins.\"\n\nGreg Albert wants more people to eat prawns to support the local industry. (Supplied)\n\nWhy the monsoonal nightmare?\n\nMr Van Wyk said Queensland's month-late wet season flushed out many of the prawns, leaving few for trawlers to snag.\n\n\"We're basically looking at probably one of the, if not the, worst banana prawn season start we've ever had in history,\" he said.\n\nBanana prawns typically settle into northern rivers, and the first downpour of rain during January or February flushes them into the Gulf, Mr Van Wyk said.\n\nBut since the big wet came later in March, many prawns failed to escape and became prey for other animals in the rivers.\n\nBanana prawn season in northern Australia runs from late March to mid June, but the 2025 season started late. (Supplied: Michele Burford)\n\nHe said the ones that did get out were smaller than ideal.\n\n\"It's incredibly tough, probably the toughest it's ever been,\" he said.\n\nMr Van Wyk said the season was likely to close early, and 20 per cent of the northern prawn fishery chose to not head out at all.\n\n\"We currently have the lowest amount of vessels that have ever participated in the northern prawn fishery banana season of all time,\" he said.\n\nFewer vessels are heading out into northern waters this year because prawn numbers are expected to be so low. (ABC North West Queensland)\n\nBut he was confident the tide would turn for the boom-and-bust industry.\n\n\"There's still a bright future ahead, we've just got to get to that bright future,\" he said.\n\nEmpty ocean, empty nets\n\nRaptis fleet manager Phil Robinson echoed Mr Van Wyk's sentiment and said he had not seen a worse season in 25 years.\n\n\"The late wet season has very much impacted the banana prawn season,\" he said.\n\nHe said the deluge in March was far too late to prompt any meaningful catches for fishers, and sizes were down, but the quality of prawns would remain high.\n\nPrawn fishers are concerned about the late wet season in the gulf. (Supplied: Austral Fisheries)\n\nMr Albert said the late wet season impacted the aggregations, and his catch so far was \"pretty average\".\n\n\"A lot of the product has been a couple of counts smaller than previous years,\" he said.\n\nHe said he had left one trawler out of the Gulf waters, with high fuel prices, lack of mother shipping and low sale prices all factors in the decision.\n\n\"We can only go out and catch what's there and try and get it to market in the best quality we can,\" he said.",

(Supplied)\n\nHowever, the convergence of her family's conservative Muslim culture with her more progressive Western lifestyle hasn't been easy.\n\nMuna recalls having a conversation with her father as a teenager, which is when she understood her family was growing with her and she needed to give them grace.\n\n\"That was a moment where I was like, 'I need to work with them',\" she says.\n\n\" The freer I am with [my parents], the easier it is for me to authentically be myself and blend my two worlds together. \"\n\nJoining forces on diaspora representation\n\nKevin and Muna have recently collaborated to create Westerners, a TV comedy pilot funded through ABC's Fresh Blood initiative, which follows three young diaspora adults navigating life in Western Sydney.\n\nIt's a story close to both of their hearts, with the pair drawing from their own lived experiences navigating identity, belonging, and being caught between cultures.\n\nKevin Han and Muna Hamid on the set of Westerners.

They've just rejected it,\" Climate Council CEO Amanda McKenzie said.\n\n\" There is not a single policy there to cut climate pollution. So what that says to me is they are hell bent on continuing the climate crisis getting worse and worse. \"\n\nTony Wood, the Grattan Institute's energy and climate director, said everything the Coalition announced so far would either slow down or curb emissions reduction.\n\n\"I think we're at one of those points where what happens at this election will have enormous consequences, not just for the energy system, but also for our emissions more generally.\"\n\nThe Coalition\u2019s climate platform consists of using nuclear energy to decarbonise the electricity grid, despite its own modelling indicating it will result in higher emissions between now and when any reactors would come online.\n\nStay updated: Federal election live updates: Get the latest news from the campaign trail Catch the latest interviews and in-depth coverage on ABC iview and ABC Listen\n\nWhat has Labor done for the climate?\n\nLabor has made inroads in its last term of office on the regulatory and policy framework that could guide Australia's transition to a green economy, the often unsexy work of climate progress.\n\nCEO of the Climate Council, Amanda McKenzie. (ABC News: Supplied)\n\nSome of the changes introduced under the last government include: new laws so that Australia's biggest corporations have to disclose their climate risk and actions; strengthening the regulation of Australia's biggest polluters; and introducing emissions standards for cars sold into the country.\n\nAt the same time, it continued to approve new coal and gas projects, disappointing climate advocates such as the Climate Council's CEO, Amanda McKenzie.\n\n\"It's sort of two sides of the one coin. You've got to grow the good stuff and you've got to stop the bad stuff. We've been doing a lot of the growing the good stuff,\" McKenzie said.\n\n\" We need to continue doing all the good stuff around the clean energy, but we need to work hard on replacing fossil fuels and exiting fossil fuels from our system much more quickly. \"\n\nClimate policies matter because they send strong signals to investors and companies about the path Australia is on, and also offer the structure for how Australia could bring down emissions across the economy (whether they do lower emissions remains to be seen).\n\nWhile most of the focus has been on energy in this election, these policies are firmly in the Coalition's crosshairs.\n\n\"This is a really interesting fork in the road. And I've never seen a situation where we've had such a divergence of proposals from the two sides of politics,\" Tony Wood said.\n\nCleaning up our transport emissions\n\nTransport makes up more than 20 per cent of Australia's total emissions. (ABC News)\n\nLast week, the opposition leader confirmed that if elected, he would end a popular tax break for electric cars aimed at reducing the cost of switching to electric.\n\nThe car industry told the ABC the policy has driven a spike in EV sales and reversing it would increase the cost for Australians of going electric.\n\nThe benefit allows people to lease an electric car through a novated leasing arrangement without paying fringe benefits tax. It's intended to boost the number of electric cars coming into the second-hand market in a few years when the leases end.\n\nDutton has promised to scrap the penalties under the new fuel efficiency standards, weakening them significantly as there would be no consequences if car makers flout the rules.\n\nSet to come into effect this July, the fuel efficiency standards ensure car makers supply Australia with more-efficient petrol cars and more hybrid and electric cars, which are cheaper to run and better for the climate.\n\nSuch regulations are standard in most countries around the world, with Russia being one of the only developed countries without one.\n\nThe policy works by setting an emissions limit for each manufacturer on all the cars it sells cars into the Australian market. It means the car companies can still sell any higher-polluting cars they want, but will have to offset them with more efficient models.\n\nCar makers are only fined if they go over their cap for three consecutive years, but Dutton wants to scrap the penalties altogether.\n\n\"The policy that Dutton has proposed would totally undermine the new vehicle efficiency standards,\" the Climate Council's Amanda McKenzie said.\n\n\"That policy is intended to reduce climate pollution [by] more than 300 million tonnes.

(ABC News)\n\nAustralia has a target of a 43 per cent emissions cut by 2030, promised by Labor at the last election and legislated by parliament.\n\nThe Coalition is critical of Australia\u2019s 2030 target. After statement made in an election debate by shadow minister for climate change and energy, Ted O\u2019Brien, the Coalition had to clarify that it was still committed to the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn a statement to the ABC, the Coalition campaign said it wouldn\u2019t set any targets in opposition \u201cbut we will be required to do so in government\u201d and cast doubt on Australia\u2019s ability to hit the current 2030 target.\n\n\u201cThe emissions reduction targets we set from government will consider the impact on the economy, the trajectory of emissions, and our own policies,\u201d the statement read.\n\nTrump 2.0 targets climate action Photo shows A projection on buildings shows an outline of Donald Trump's hair being blown by a wind turbine, with the words FUTURE VS TRUMP President Donald Trump has wasted no time dismantling climate policies and promising a new era of fossil-fuel dominance.\n\nUnder the Paris Agreement, countries are meant to increase their ambition, not weaken policies, so it's unclear what the consequences would be if the Coalition watered down the targets.\n\n\"We think this is a really important election in terms of where it is in timing, because 2030 is very close for major investment. If we start veering off moving towards that target, it's really hard to get back on track,\" Grattan's Tony Wood said.\n\nIn the last term of parliament, the teal independents supported the government in passing its 43 per cent target, while at the same making it clear that they wanted it to be higher. Independents such as Monique Ryan, Zoe Daniel and David Pocock want to see a target of a 60 per cent emissions reduction by 2030.\n\nThe teal Independents have called for more ambitious climate targets. (Reuters: Simon Dawson)\n\nThe Greens want to see Australia adopt a 75 per cent target for 2030, which is what the Climate Council is advocating for.\n\nIn government, Labor held off announcing a 2035 target until it receives advice from the independent Climate Change Authority.\n\nSwapping fossil fuels for clean energy\n\nRenewable energy is rapidly increasing, with a pipeline of projects under construction. (ABC News)\n\nAustralia's 2030 climate target hangs on decarbonising the electricity sector first, which can then help other areas like transport and industry reduce their emissions.\n\nAustralia has a target of getting to 82 per cent renewable energy by the end of the decade. Currently, around 40 per cent of the electricity system is already renewable, and there is a pipeline of projects already under construction or in the planning stages.\n\nThe independent Climate Change Authority reported to the government last year that emissions need to start falling faster if Australia is to hit that 2030 target.\n\nRegardless, the Coalition\u2019s plans to flood the market with gas, as it\u2019s been described, and to also build taxpayer-funded nuclear power plants would both diminish renewables investment, according to energy experts.\n\nGas policy has devil in the detail Photo shows Liquified natural gas plant and LNG ship on Curtis Island, Queensland Experts say plans to bring more gas online are years away and will fail to provide immediate relief to power prices.\n\nUnder the nuclear pathway, renewable energy would only supply around 54 per cent of Australia's energy mix, a small increase from the current 40 per cent.\n\n\"What the opposition has put together over the last few months has been a series of policies that would generate a very different mix of electricity generation,\" the Grattan Institute's Tony Wood said.\n\n\"In government, a Coalition government would slow down the move to renewables and the transmission that goes with that. It would extend the life of coal-fired power stations somewhat, and it would introduce more gas generation into the mix so that the system remains reliable until we then had nuclear.\"\n\nAccording to the Clean Energy Council, capping renewables at 54 per cent would forego $58 billion of new private investment in large-scale solar and wind projects and Australia would reach the cap in another four years.\n\nDirector of the Energy Program at Grattan Institute, Tony Wood. (ABC News: Sean Warren)\n\n\"What's happening now is considerable uncertainty and flip-flopping is not good at all for investment,\" Wood said.\n\n\"We already know that the uncertainty around offshore wind and the uncertainty around some renewable projects has meant that people say, 'well, we better stop, right?'\"\n\nIn its statement to the ABC, the Coalition referred to modelling from Frontier Economics that shows electricity sector emissions will be lower in the middle of the century.\n\n\u201c... emissions in the Coalition\u2019s plan will drop below Labor\u2019s before 2050, and will generate fewer emissions in 2050 and beyond.\u201d\n\nBut because CO2 emissions remain in the atmosphere, overall, the modelling shows far higher cumulative emissions for the Coalition\u2019s plan.\n\nThat modelling also only accounts for the electricity sector and assumes there's a slower uptake of other clean technologies and a smaller economy overall.\n\nThe Climate Change Authority estimates a nuclear policy would add two billion tonnes of climate pollution by delaying the transition. The modelling that forms the basis of the Coalition plan also has much higher emissions.\n\nUsing 'green' money for more gas\n\nThe Coalition proposes to include gas projects in the Capital Investment Scheme. (ABC News)\n\nThe Coalition has focused on gas this election more than the nuclear policy it spent most of last year pitching to voters. In his budget reply speech, Peter Dutton promised to open up the Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS) to allow gas projects.\n\nThe CIS is a government program to boost renewables investment by underwriting major projects, taking some of the financial risk out for investors.\n\nIt applies to clean power generation (wind, solar) and storage and has so far secured 32 gigawatt of capacity by 2030.\n\nThis policy has allowed the government to secure renewable projects into the grid as the country's ageing coal power stations retire, and to plot a trajectory for how Australia's dirtiest sector \u2014 electricity \u2014 will reduce emissions.\n\nLabor's plan for the electricity grid still involves some gas, and it has refused to address the issue of Australia's gas export industry despite calls from climate experts.\n\nHolding the dirtiest 200 to account\n\nThe Safeguard Mechanism aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from Australia's largest industrial facilities. (ABC News)\n\nThe safeguard mechanism policy is the groaning machinery that underpins much of Australia's climate response, but thanks to its complexity, it is often overlooked and under-acknowledged.\n\nFirst introduced under former Liberal prime minister Tony Abbott, it sets the rules for how much Australia's dirtiest facilities can pollute each year, and was reformed and strengthened in the last parliamentary term.\n\nIt covers just over 200 facilities across industries like mining, manufacturing, waste and gas, which account for almost a third of Australia's emissions.\n\n\"The safeguard mechanism is the only policy that we have that regulates fossil fuel pollution from industry. So it's a really important piece of our policy mix,\" the Climate Council's Amanda McKenzie said.\n\nEach facility has its own cap for annual emissions, called a baseline, which decline at five per cent each year to 2030, plus there's an overall limit or \"hard cap\" on the emissions across all facilities.\n\nImportantly, the safeguard is set in legislation, so while a sitting government can make some changes, there are fundamental tenets that can't be altered without a vote in parliament.\n\nAustralia's key climate policy faces an uncertain future Photo shows A close up view of a smoke stack at the Whyalla steelworks, taken at sunset Some business and climate groups have voiced their support for keeping one of the federal government's key climate policies in place, with the Coalition yet to commit to its future.\n\nLast month, the AFR newspaper reported that a Coalition government would look at \"relaxing\" the mechanism, which it voted against strengthening in the last term of parliament.\n\nAmanda McKenzie said the safeguard mechanism was already a flawed policy, allowing polluters to buy or trade offsets to meet their targets.\n\n\"It's not a strong enough policy \u2026 it includes offsets, which enable companies to have a get-out-of-jail-free card when we need genuine reductions in pollution. So what we'll be advocating for in the next term is to strengthen that piece of reform.\"\n\nData from the first year of the revamped safeguard mechanism has just been released and has found that 60 per cent of the facilities used offsets to meet their targets.\n\nPlugging in our future energy system\n\nRewiring the Nation aims to modernise and upgrade Australia's electricity grid. (ABC News)\n\nThe Rewiring the Nation policy helps fund the construction of transmission lines needed to move renewable electricity around the system.\n\nTransmission projects have become a sensitive topic politically, with some people in regional Australia, where most of these projects run, mounting opposition to them.\n\nThe Coalition latched onto these concerns, and said that its nuclear policy would alleviate the need for as many transmission projects as electricity generation would remain centralised at the existing coal power stations.\n\n\u201cRenewable energy deployment will still grow responsibly under the Coalition\u2019s plan, but we will avoid the massive overbuild required for Labor\u2019s plan,\u201d the campaign told the ABC.\n\nBut energy expert Tony Wood says these projects will be needed before the Coalition's nuclear power stations would start running.\n\n\"They are becoming critical to maintaining the current reliability of the system,\" he said.\n\n\"As we find the coal-fired power stations becoming less reliable as they get older, the need to be able to move electricity between states when something does go wrong in one state becomes really important,\" Wood said.\n\n\"I think a Coalition government would be faced with some quite difficult challenges if they were to seriously try and slow down the building of some of those transmission lines.\"\n\nThe roll-out of transmission projects has sparked backlash in the regions. (Supplied: EnergyCo)\n\nWood says that Australia won't be able to connect enough renewables to meet its other targets without speeding up the transmission rollout.\n\n\"We haven't been building the necessary transmission to connect the expansion of renewable energy, wind farms, and solar farms, which have to be built in places we've never had generation before. So to connect those generators to the main grid needs more transmission.\"\n\nWhat could happen to climate after the election\n\nThe world is already halfway through what climate experts call the critical decade. In Australia, there are several climate issues that are likely to be prominent in the next parliamentary term.\n\nLabor dumped its plans to introduce a federal environmental protection agency before the election, and held off on proposing a climate trigger into the national environmental laws.\n\nThe election will have a significant impact on how Australia tackles climate change over the coming years. (Supplied: Spyrakot)\n\nCurrently, major developments can be assessed and rejected if they impact the surrounding ecosystems, threatened species, waterways, but not if they have a significant climate impact.\n\n\"It's 2025 and we don't have any way of stopping projects on a climate basis,\" Amanda McKenzie said.\n\nThe Australia Conservation Foundation ranked the major parties and key independents on their climate and environment policies, and gave the Coalition just 1/100, while Labor was rated 54/100.\n\n\"Labor scored points for its work on the clean energy and clean manufacturing transition and its strong stance against costly, thirsty, risky nuclear power, but lost points for its commitment to expanding the climate-wrecking coal and gas industries,\" ACF lead Kelly O'Shannassy said.\n\nIf it wins, Labor wants to host the major UN climate conference next year alongside Pacific countries as host, which will ratchet up the pressure on Australia to outline its position on fossil fuels.\n\nIn a statement to the ABC, climate minister Chris Bowen said that acting on climate change is in the national interest, calling its reforms \u201coverdue\u201d.\n\n\u201cAustralians don\u2019t want to see more tired, frustrating climate wars, that only see us miss the economic opportunities of the global push towards Net Zero.\"\n\nHow Australia faces the climate challenge over the next three years will be different depending on the outcome on May 3. If there is a hung parliament, climate policies will be a strong negotiating point with the teal independents and the Greens.\n\nAs Grattan's Tony Wood points out, three years is a long time in a world that's changing fast.\n\n\"If the current government was to be re-elected for another three-year term, that would almost make it impossible for the coalition's nuclear plan, as they've described it, to actually be implemented. It would be too late,\" Wood concluded.",

        "text": "With Wallabies coach Joe Schmidt holding his cards close to his chest (at least publicly), it remains anyone's guess as to who will start at fly half for the first Test against the British and Irish Lions in July.\n\nThe Western Force's Ben Donaldson has been the clubhouse leader, especially with Noah Lolesio showing inconsistent form for the ACT Brumbies in the Super Rugby Pacific competition.\n\nDonaldson's main challenger may prove to be Tom Lynagh, who produced a player-of-the-match performance in the Queensland Reds' 35\u201421 victory over the Blues in Brisbane on Friday night.\n\nLynagh \u2014 who made three Test appearances as a reserve for the Wallabies in 2024 \u2014 illustrated his ability to take the ball to the defensive line in attack when he scored the opening try of the match in the fourth minute.\n\nHis tactical kicking ignited the play that led to his second try only minutes later, sending the ball to the sky with a perfectly weighted bomb that resulted in the Blues messing up their kick reception.\n\nThe Reds pounced on the turnover from the defending champions, with Lynagh scoring in the ensuing phase play.\n\nLynagh was awarded the Sellars Dixon Medal after being named player of the match. (Getty Images: Chris Hyde)\n\nLike Donaldson, the Italy-born Lynagh poses a threat in the second line of attack, as he displayed against the Blues, while he's also a competent tackler who doesn't shirk from his defensive responsibilities.\n\nLynagh is still learning the craft at the professional level, so it's not surprising a degree of casualness can creep into his game.\n\nHe threw a lazy pass to Zane Nonggorr soon after half-time that handed possession over to the Blues, who were initially awarded a try in the following phase-play, only for it to be disallowed because of an earlier knock-on.\n\nThere are still five rounds left in the regular season and potentially a finals series for the fourth-placed Reds, giving Lynagh the opportunity to iron out chinks in his armour.\n\nIt would be a proud family moment should Lynagh earn selection to face the Lions, given his father Michael played in the 1989 series.\n\nWhile the Lions took the honours on that occasion, British and Irish rugby fans with long memories would be mindful of the misery Michael Lynagh inflicted on their respective nations during his decorated career.\n\nHe was an integral member of the Wallabies' Grand Slam-winning side in 1984 and helped orchestrate the last-gasp quarterfinal victory over Ireland in the successful 1991 World Cup campaign, which was iced by the 12\u20146 defeat of England in the tournament decider.\n\nMcDermott keeps on keeping on\n\nPerhaps enhancing Lynagh's selection hopes is the effective halves combination he has developed alongside Reds co-captain Tate McDermott.\n\nLast week's column argued McDermott is the frontrunner to play scrum half for the Wallabies against the Lions and he only boosted his chances with another sound knock for the Reds in the win over the Blues.\n\nHis highlights reel featured an outstanding try in the 51st minute when the Reds were nervously leading 14\u20147.\n\nFrom the base of a ruck, McDermott shaped to pass just outside the Blues' 22, but spotted a gap in the defensive line, through which he galloped on his way to crossing the stripe.\n\nTate McDermott's try effectively killed off any hope of a Blues victory. (Getty Images: Chris Hyde)\n\nMcDermott's try, converted by Lynagh, gave the Reds a 14-point advantage, which the Blues could not overcome.\n\nHe also impressed in defence, having teamed up with Lynagh to hold out Kurt Eklund over the line during a sustained period of attack from the Blues.\n\nMcDermott only started in one Test in 2024, but came off the bench in another 11 internationals, replacing Jake Gordon on most of those occasions.\n\nHis solid form this year \u2014 and the fact Gordon has missed a large chunk of the NSW Waratahs' season through injury \u2014 points to him having the inside running for the Wallabies' number nine jersey.\n\nBrumbies come up short\n\nDespite scoring the first try, the Brumbies always seemed to be a step behind the Hurricanes in their 35\u201429 loss to the visitors at Canberra Stadium on Saturday night.\n\nSuper Rugby Pacific results: Chiefs def Force 56\u201422 in Tauranga\n\nReds def Blues 35\u201421 in Brisbane\n\nMoana Pasifika def Fijian Drua 34\u201415 in Albany\n\nCrusaders def Highlanders 43\u201410 in Dunedin\n\nHurricanes def Brumbies 35\u201429 in Canberra\n\nThe Hurricanes scored five tries to four and enjoyed more time with ball in hand, having restricted the Brumbies to 42 per cent of possession.\n\nAs Brumbies captain Allan Alaalatoa said after the match, his side made good use of the ball they had, but it was a case of them needing \"more of it\".\n\nThey didn't help themselves defensively, missing 46 of their 232 tackle attempts, while coach Stephen Larkham admitted his troops was beaten by the Hurricanes in the breakdown battle.\n\nThe Brumbies also conceded 10 penalties to five, including seven inside their half.\n\nBut the line-out was on song, with each of their throws finding its target.\n\nIt was an up and down night for the Brumbies, who stay third on the standings but trail the Chiefs and Crusaders by eight points.\n\nTheir fortunes were reflected in Tom Wright's performance, with the Wallabies fullback balancing bright patches with lacklustre moments.\n\nThe Hurricanes forced the Brumbies to play catch-up for much of the match. (Getty images: Mark Nolan)\n\nWright's efficient work over the ball earned a breakdown penalty during the first half and he threw a well-timed lofted pass to Andy Muirhead for the Brumbies flyer's late try.\n\nBut missed tackles, giving up a penalty and a spilt high ball were examples of when Wright put the Brumbies under pressure.\n\nAs superbly as Wright played for the Wallabies last year, his hold on the fullback role may be under threat from Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii.\n\nSuaalii has started at fullback in all but one of his five appearances for the Waratahs this season, impressing in the position since returning from a toe injury.\n\nHe will figure in the Wallabies' backline against the Lions, however it's just a matter of whether it will be at fullback or in the centres.\n\nWright and Suaalii will face each other when the Brumbies play the Waratahs in Canberra on Saturday night.\n\nThe showdown will no doubt be seen by many as a form guide as to who will play 15 against the Lions.\n\nWaratahs to decide on Tupou\n\nThe Wright vs Suaalii plot-line will be among several enticing match-ups in the capital on the weekend.\n\nSet to create interest is the potential meeting between Australia's two most talented tight-head props \u2014 Alaalatoa and the Waratahs' Taniela Tupou.\n\nBut this will largely depend on Tupou starting against the Brumbies.\n\nHe played off the bench against Moana Pasifika and the Chiefs in rounds eight and nine, before being rested against Fijian Drua due to the national rotation policy.\n\nTaniela Tupou has not started for the Waratahs since their round-seven match against the Hurricanes. (Getty Images: Hagen Hopkins)\n\nDaniel Botha has started at tight-head in the Waratahs' past three matches.\n\nTupou's demotion to the reserves came after the Waratahs were hammered 57\u201412 by the Hurricanes in round seven, with coach Dan McKellar saying he wanted to get \"more out\" of the Wallabies bookend.\n\nThe ex-Melbourne Rebel has given up a lot of ground to Alaalatoa, who has been the best-performed Australian tight-head this season.\n\nForce hit with leadership void\n\nThe Western Force were already facing an uphill battle when they took the field against the Chiefs at Tauranga's Bay Oval of Friday night, missing Wallabies duo Jeremy Williams and Nic White.\n\nTheir leadership and experience were sorely missed in the 56\u201422 thumping handed out by the competition-leading Chiefs, who were without injured All Black Damian McKenzie.\n\nDespite being in front on the scoreboard twice in the first half, not much went right for the Force.\n\nPoor defensive reads were costly, as proven by Chiefs scrum half Cortez Ratima's back-to-back tries in the second term.\n\nHarry Potter scored a double in the Force's heavy loss to the Chiefs. (Getty Images: Michael Bradley)\n\nMissing skipper Williams, the Force's line-out was often dysfunctional, although a Darcy Swain steal did spark Bayley Kuenzle's try in the fifth minute of play.\n\nFrom a Wallabies perspective, there was scarcely a Force player who pushed their selection claims for the Lions series, although winger Harry Potter's second try showed a touch of brilliance.\n\nThe Force slipped to sixth on the standings, staying on 22 points, with the Waratahs (21 points) now seventh.\n\nAfter licking their wounds following the defeat to the Chiefs, the Force will conclude a testing road trip in New Zealand when they clash with the Blues at Eden Park on Friday night.",

(Getty: Paul Kane)\n\nHowever, she said friends of hers had been in similar situations to Merrett.\n\n\"I've also asked for help and often \u2014 and it's not the MCG staff's problem \u2014 but they often don't know where it is, or it'll be on the other side of the members, a million miles away,\" Brown said.\n\n\"If they left their kid at home, or if it's a night game, you still have to pump if you're feeding that way.\n\n\"So often, that's just you standing in a cubicle or sitting on the loo by yourself with the machine whirring in the background having not a nice or relaxed experience.\n\nYour stories of breastfeeding in public Photo shows Nicole and her youngest breastfeeding in the pool While some caregivers told us they don't hesitate to breastfeed in shared spaces, others explained it isn't always straightforward.\n\n\"And all those things can add stress because it's [already] very hard and stressful being a parent and there's lots of emotion involved in breastfeeding, lots of pain. It can be very difficult.\"\n\nDepending on the person and age of the child, Brown said pumping could take anywhere between 10 minutes to half an hour.\n\nAs Merrett experienced, mums often don't have a lot of time to find a room to feed or pump, especially if they don't know where they're going and in a crowded stadium.\n\nMcKimm said there were extra things that needed to be considered during a breastfeeding period, including planning around feeding or pumping times, having all the right equipment, and making sure the painful experience of mastitis (inflammation caused by blocked milk) is avoided.\n\nBrown said they were all reasons why it was important to remove as many barriers as possible for new mums going to the footy.",

Change in net general government debt \u2014 which includes the federal and state governments \u2014 had averaged just 2 per cent of gross domestic product since the global financial crisis of 2008-09.\n\nTreasurer Dr Jim Chalmers during a doorstop interview following the final leaders\u2019 debate.

        "text": "Loading The International Energy Agency had forecast that demand for oil would increase about 1.03 million barrels a day. After Liberation Day it cut that forecast by about a third, to 730,000 barrels a day, saying about half that reduction was attributable to lower demand in the US and China as a result of the trade war. Demand is, of course, only half of the equation that generates prices. The other half is supply, and it is increasing even as demand is falling. On the day Trump unveiled his new tariffs, OPEC+ said they would unwind the 6 million barrels a day or so of cuts they have made over the past three years at a faster pace than they had previously planned, adding about 411,000 barrels a day to supply from next month. The move is seen as an attempt by Saudi Arabia, which has borne the brunt of the past cuts to production, to punish those members of the cartel that haven\u2019t met their own commitments to constrain their production. Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Iraq have all been producing above their agreed caps.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cGolden Age\u201d for US oil \u2013 he has said he wants to double US oil production, which reached record levels during the Biden administration \u2013 is not going to happen if demand weakens even as supply increases. He may get the other thing he wished for \u2013 lower US gasoline prices \u2013 but for less palatable reasons than the giant surge in US production he anticipated. The US shale sector is unlikely to take any heed of his urgings to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d while domestic oil prices are languishing at their current levels. While break-even levels for shale producers vary according to the richness and productivity of the various basins, a rough guide is that to break even \u2013 pay all costs, including operating and financing costs and also pay a dividend \u2013 US onshore oil companies need a price of between $US62 and $US65 a barrel. Today, however, it isn\u2019t just the oil price that dictates whether they drill wells or not. Drilling rigs require lots of steel and there are also many components imported from China. Trump\u2019s steel tariffs and his 145 per cent tariff on most imports from China are driving up the sector\u2019s costs.\n\nToday\u2019s shale industry has been heavily consolidated and is financially disciplined, with a focus on returns on capital. Where once Wall Street rewarded shale oil and gas companies for their production, now it rewards them for their returns on capital and punishes sub-optimal activity. Loading According to energy technology company Baker-Hughes, there are about 23 fewer oil rigs operating today than there were a year ago and, at 483, only just over half the record number of rigs \u2013888 \u2013 set in 2018. Industry executives are warning that if prices fall back further, the number of operating rigs will fall much further. With the best fields\u2019 reserves declining and costs increasing, the US shale sector was never going to double its production. While production was expected to continue to grow incrementally, peak production was expected to occur before the end of the decade, although Trump\u2019s deregulation and opening of federal lands to exploration and drilling might have stretched the timeline.\n\nA US and, perhaps, global recession would, of course, further darken the outlook for demand and undermine the economics of production. While those recessions are not yet seen as probable, both the IMF\u2019s odds on a US recession and those of private forecasters have been shortening. The risk of a severe downturn in the economy adds another layer of uncertainty to the outlook for US energy companies, as does the potential for Trump to do a deal with Vladimir Putin that would lift the sanctions on Russian oil (Russian drilling has already begun increasing in anticipation) and add to the global surplus of supply. Early this month, Trump\u2019s energy secretary, Chris Wright, told the Financial Times that the shale producers could boost their output even at $US50 a barrel. Less than a fortnight later he said $US50 a barrel oil wasn\u2019t sustainable for producers. Wright, before taking up the role in the administration, was chief executive of Denver-based Liberty Energy \u2013 America\u2019s second-biggest \u201cfracker\u201d \u2013 which earlier this month announced a first-quarter profit of $US20 million, down from $US82 million in the same quarter last year and the $US52 million it earned in the December quarter last year. Liberty\u2019s share price was around $US22.60 when Trump took office again. Today\u2019s it\u2019s just over $US12. The company\u2019s market capitalisation has slumped from $US3.7 billion to $US1.97 billion over that period.\n\nLoading The current chief executive, Ron Gusek, believes that producers can maintain their drilling at current levels as long as the price remains in the low $US60s a barrel but are likely to start shutting down wells if the prices dropped any further. Maybe he had a chat with Wright, although the precipitous fall in his old company\u2019s share price might also have grabbed Wright\u2019s attention. Trump\u2019s \u201cbabies\u201d aren\u2019t going to increase their drilling and production at current prices. At best they will, regardless of his urgings, try to maintain current levels. At worst? Trump\u2019s tariffs, a US and global economic slowdown/recession and rising production volumes from OPEC+ will result in production cuts to a sector that generated more than 15 per cent of America\u2019s exports last year and gave the country a $US45 billion energy surplus. The billionaire donors to Trump\u2019s campaign should, perhaps, have been more careful of what they wished for, looking beyond his energy and tax policies to his wider platform, and the trade policies in particular.",

        "text": "Consider a missive sent out to NRL coaches ahead of round 8. It warned against a minor breach of \u201cswitching halves\u201d \u2013 that is, the practice of the man about to feed a scrum, placing the ball quickly on the ground, then racing to take a place as first receiver in the backline, while another player detaches from the scrum, picks up the ball and feeds it into the scrum. Insofar as teams are not permitted to have more than seven backs at a scrum, this is a breach.\n\nAnother warning related to non-warnings \u2013 that is, referees are not obligated to issue a caution ahead of sin-binning a player. Then followed a list of sins such as \u201cescorts\u201d, \u201cflops\u201d, \u201crolled ball\u201d, \u201cstripping\u201d, and marker depth.\n\nThese are not called crackdowns but \u201cfocus\u201d areas, as in the line to clubs from NRL referees coach, David Fairleigh ahead of round 7: \u201cYou can expect the referee to have a higher focus on this area.\u201d Then followed injunctions against \u201ccontact on the kicker\u201d, \u201claying in the ruck\u201d, \u201cflops\u201d and \u201cchecking of gear\u201d.\n\nBut note that in these two missives, there is no warning of action against high tackles, despite round 8 producing a historic high 18 sin bins, 15 for contact with the head. That warning came after round 4 when NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo conceded officials had missed four high tackles where they should have sent players to the sin bin. NRL headquarters subsequently sent a memo to clubs warning of an increased incidence of \u201cshoulder to the head\u201d contact.\n\nIn the Penrith v Manly match, Sharpe penalised a Sea Eagles player for this offence but his captain challenged it and the bunker agreed. While some will say Sharpe got it wrong, the NRL will argue that video referee Ashley Klein got it right when he over-ruled her. Furthermore, headquarters will contend the recent action against high tackles is not so much an over-reaction, as it was with the plethora of penalties in magic round 2021, but a \u201ccorrection\u201d to the incidents in round 4.",

        "text": "In France, child beauty salons, much like Moony\u2019s, are opening at pace and finding themselves booked for months. In the States, the Sephora hashtag caught on after social media reported growing numbers of kids flocking to the stores, although Sephora itself makes it clear it does not put on make-over events. (A spokesperson says the company \u201cdoes not offer a formal party programme for customers of any age\u201d in the UK, and stresses that \u201cchildren under 16 cannot sign up for or receive a beauty service without the permission and attendance of a parent.\u201d) Nevertheless, children\u2019s appetite for beauty products seems insatiable. Data from market research company NielsenIQ (NIQ) found US consumers under the age of 14 drove 49 per cent of drug store skincare sales in 2023. TikTok has a lot to do with it, say parents. Dewy-skinned children \u2013 many not yet teenagers \u2013 beam into their cameras demonstrating make-up and carefully curated beauty routines. The hashtag #GRWM \u2013 Get Ready With Me \u2013 has billions of views. Kim Kardashian\u2019s 11-year-old daughter North West, whose joint account with her mother has 19.3 million followers, is an icon of these so-called \u201cskinfluencers\u201d. The Garza Crew (@garzacrew) with five million followers is another, and features a mum and her pre-tween twins from Oklahoma posting avidly.\n\nData from Statista reveals the baby and child skincare market is expected to experience a yearly rise of around 7.71 percent from now until 2028, when it will reach \u00a3299 million in market volume worldwide. Popular products with children include the brand Drunk Elephant. Slaai Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser retails at \u00a337 ($AU77). \u201cNot every product in our line should be used by younger fans, 12 and under,\u201d the website small print warns. Even Christian Dior has launched a Baby Dior skincare collection. Alcohol-free Bonne \u00c9toile Scented Water retails at \u00a3230 ($AU479). Back in Havant, the birthday girl, five, is only concerned with one brand: Disney. Her outfit incorporates a yellow \u201cBelle\u201d dress and sparkly blue \u201cElsa\u201d shoes. She giggles as her hair is brushed because it tickles, and selects a \u201cdo\u201d from a picture menu. Coloured bands and glitter sit next to a very large can of \u201cultra strong power hold\u201d hair spray. From the array of make-up, it\u2019s the zany colours and glitter sticks that are chosen, but there are BB cream bases, mascaras, and blushers too, which I\u2019m advised are for older children. At the nail bar I\u2019m told the polishes are all child-friendly and peel off. The young customers exclaim when they feel the heat of the dryer, but bear with it with a surprisingly mature perseverance \u2013 albeit singing along to the Hokey Cokey.\n\nThe birthday girl\u2019s dad says her love of beauty has \u201cbeen more of a thing in the last year or so\u201d. \u201cShe just loves princesses,\u201d he says. \u201cBut she\u2019ll still make horrible faces and some days just wants to wear what she\u2019s picked off the floor.\u201d Loading Wanting to wear make-up like a grown-up is perhaps nothing new. But there\u2019s a shift at Moony\u2019s second party of the day, for an 11-year-old, her nine-year-old sister, and their 11-year-old friend. They\u2019re having facials and foot spas, and taking it seriously. They\u2019re each presented with a mirror and a range of cosmetics. First, they\u2019re instructed to cleanse their faces \u2013 I\u2019m assured it\u2019s water they\u2019re using \u2013 and then move on to jade stone facial rollers, yoghurt and cucumber face masks, and moisturiser, which I\u2019m told is emollient cream, suitable for babies. They stare intensely at their reflections as they sing along to Taylor Swift. After a quick face \u201cmist\u201d they are ushered to pink armchairs for brightly coloured \u201cjelly foot spas\u201d. No one can tell me what\u2019s in this, but it looks like slime.\n\nThe girls \u2013 one shows me the fake eyelashes she\u2019s wearing, a weekend treat \u2013 sigh as they sink their pale feet in. This is self-care, they say. The birthday girl\u2019s mother explains she wanted to give her daughter the party she craved, but is candid about her worries. \u201cShe\u2019s always on TikTok, and wants to use the new face serums, wear make-up at weekends,\u201d she says, adding that she insists on buying all her daughter\u2019s products and ensuring they\u2019re gentle. Her younger daughter has expressed concerns about her appearance. \u201cI tell her she\u2019s beautiful and too young (to worry),\u201d she says. Tessa Stevens, 49, is a skincare expert of 32 years. Over the past 18 months, she has received a growing number of enquiries about treatments like facials for children, but declines if they\u2019re under 12. Over 12, she will usually only consider a consultation if they have a skin condition, such as acne. \u201cI believe there is room for services in beauty clinics for our younger generation,\u201d she says. \u201cBut this should be very limited. And it should always start with an in-depth consultation, which should include the parent, guardian or carer. Teaching them how to take care of their skin and reassuring them the changes they are going through are very normal.\u201d\n\nTweens and teenage girls have long indulged in makeup and beauty treatments but the age group is now trending younger. Credit: Getty Images Many products aren\u2019t appropriate for younger kids, she says, especially those containing salicylic acids, vitamin A and hyaluronic acid, trendy on TikTok. \u201cWhy a 10-year-old needs to use hyaluronic acid [popular for its anti-ageing properties] is beyond me,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir skin\u2019s an organ and it can\u2019t tolerate those types of ingredients or daily exposure. It\u2019s not developed properly yet. You can cause long-term damage.\u201d She\u2019s not against playful hair and make-up, but believes the environment of a salon, psychologically, isn\u2019t appropriate for a young child. \u201cWe don\u2019t need children to direct their thought process onto the way they\u2019re looking,\u201d she says. \u201cMy daughter is nine and she doesn\u2019t even know what Sephora is.\u201d She admits she has allowed her to attend a pamper party to join her friends, but they spoke about how it \u201cwasn\u2019t for everyday\u201d. Tai was inspired by her own daughters, aged two and six, who adore beauty. \u201cGrowing up nowadays is so different,\u201d she says. She hosts around five to six parties every weekend. Boys come too, although it\u2019s primarily girls. She researches her products and emphasises the relaxation and bonding benefits of pampering, and the \u201cplayfulness\u201d.",

        "text": "Following the death of Pope Francis, the Catholic Church is preparing for one of its most sacred traditions: The conclave.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe process is where cardinals from around the world gather to elect the next pope.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the conclave is, how long it lasts, and when it will take place.\n\n\n\nWhat is the conclave?\n\nOver its 2,000-year history, spanning three millennia, the Catholic Church has had 266 popes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a pope dies, cardinals arrive at the Vatican to elect a replacement in a process called the conclave.\n\n\n\nIt's a centuries-old tradition that takes place in the Sistine Chapel \u2014 the famous hall decorated with Michelangelo's art. Here, cardinals from around the world gather to cast anonymous votes for who they believe the next pope should be.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sistine Chapel is sealed off during the conclave to ensure total secrecy. No phones, media, or contact with the outside world is permitted.\n\n\n\n\n\nCardinals vote up to four times a day. They write their nominated names on white slips, which are counted by officials.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter each round of voting, the ballots are burned in a custom stove. If no pope is elected, black smoke rises from the chapel chimney \u2014 a sign to the outside world that voting is continuing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite smoke signals a new pope has been elected, and the process is over.\n\n\n\nEdward Berger's 2024 film, Conclave, starred Ralph Fiennes in a fictional exploration of the conclave process. Source: AP / Philippe Antonello\n\nHow many cardinals vote in the conclave?\n\nOnly cardinals under the age of 80 can cast their vote for the new pope.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2025, there are 252 cardinals. While all of them can take part in the deliberations about who should be chosen, only those under 80 years old can vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means there are only 135 eligible cardinal electors.\n\n\n\nThe country with the most eligible cardinal voters is Italy, with 17, followed by the United States with 10 and Brazil with seven.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust four are from the Oceania region, including Ukrainian-born Australian-based Bishop Mykola Bychok.\n\n\n\nWhen will the conclave take place?\n\nThe conclave usually begins between 15 to 20 days after the pope's death. This means the conclave is expected to gather between 6 May and 11 May.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Vatican will confirm the exact date once the official mourning rituals, or 'novemdiales', are completed.\n\n\n\nHow long does the conclave last?\n\nThere's no set time period that conclaves last for. Voting continues until a candidate receives a two-thirds-plus-one majority.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the past, conclaves have ranged from just one day to years. The longest was nearly three years (from 1268 to 1271) with the election of Pope Gregory X.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn more recent times, the process is typically resolved within a few days. The conclave that elected Francis in 2013 took five rounds of voting.\n\n\n\n",

It means that we can help families with the cost of living crisis that this government's created. We live in the best country in the world, but we do know that many families are doing it tough, and as we've moved around the country, we've spoken to families, literally in tears, they can't afford to put food on the table, they've stopped the registration renewal on their motor vehicle or on their house. They have had a tough three years under this government.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were times when the debate took a personal turn, with Peter Dutton accusing Anthony Albanese of being a liar, and saying he should be ashamed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, Peter can attack me, but I tell you what I won't let him do, I won't let him attack the wages of working people. I won't let him attack the changes that were put in place for cheaper childcare. I won't let him abandon free TAFE so that people can get an opportunity in life. I won't get let him get away with this nonsense about economic management.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Albanese pointed to two budget surpluses delivered by Labor, and inflation's return to the Reserve Bank's target band to defend his government's record on economic management.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton countered by saying increased real wages don't compensate for the growing cost of groceries, suggesting that in fact, core inflation remains stubbornly high.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were some rare points of agreement, though, including when host Mark Riley asked this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"RILEY: Australia Day, should we change the date?\n\n\n\n\n\nALBANESE: \"No.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDUTTON:: \"No.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond that, the leaders were less aligned on questions relating to Indigenous people.\n\n\n\n\n\nRILEY: \"Mr Dutton, as Prime Minister, we know you won't stand in front of the Indigenous flag. Will you have Welcome to Country ceremonies? Will you have smoking ceremonies? Will you acknowledge the traditional owners at your official events?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDUTTON: Well, Mark the point I've made in relation to the flag is that I don't believe that we can be the best country we can be if we're asking people to identify under different flags. No other country comparable to ours does that. I want to unite our country I want every Australian to be equal.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Dutton says it's \"fair enough\" to have a Welcome to Country ceremony for the opening of parliament as a mark of respect, but Australians have told him they're overdone, and this can cheapen the ceremony's significance.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Opposition Leader says Welcome to Country ceremonies have the potential to divide the nation, also suggesting Anthony Albanese divided Australia with the failed referendum on an Indigenous Voice to Parliament.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor his part, Mr Albanese says he accepts the outcome of the Voice referendum, saying he has moved on, and preferring to frame Welcome to Country as a matter of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Well, from my perspective, it's a matter of respect, but it's also, of course, up to the organisations that are hosting an event of whether they have a Welcome to Country or not. It's up to them, and people will have different views, and people are entitled to their views, but we have a great privilege, from my perspective, of sharing this continent with the oldest continuous culture on Earth.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leaders were also asked some lighter questions, including the price of one dozen eggs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"DUTTON: About $4.20.\n\n\n\n\n\nRILEY: \"No, you might get half a dozen.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBARR: \"Mr. Albanese?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nALBANESE: \"$7 If you can find them, because it's hard to find them at the moment. \"\n\n\n\n\n\nRILEY: \"Yeah, you're looking at, I reckon you're looking at eight plus. Nat?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBARR: \"Yeah, there you go. It's the Sunny Queen 12 eggs from Woollies, they're $8.80. From Coles, they're slightly cheaper, at about $8.50.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the first thing they think of when shown a picture of US billionaire, Elon Musk, whom US President Donald Trump has tasked with cutting government spending:\n\n\n\n\n\nALBANESE: \"Tesla, and a very rich man.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRILEY: \"Mr Dutton?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDUTTON: \"I think evil genius.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a follow up question, Peter Dutton was asked whether he's done enough to distance himself from the Trump administration's style, given Labor has sought to suggest the Coalition is adopting similar policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I haven't sought to be anybody other than myself. And I believe very strongly that based on my experience working with John Howard very closely. He's been my political mentor, and I want to make sure we manage the economy, as he did.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the election set for May 3, we will know soon enough how the style and message of both major parties resonates with Australian voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 13 per cent of ballots have already been cast through early voting, and with millions more expected in coming days, time's running out for the leaders to win voters over.\n\n\n\n\n\nChanel 7's panel of 60 undecided voters gave Mr Albanese the win, with half backing him, while 25 per cent picked Peter Dutton, and the final quarter said they remain undecided.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's those voters the leaders will still hope to win over.\n\n\n\n",

For the opening of parliament, fair enough, it's respectful to do, but for the start of every meeting at work, or the start of a football game, I think a lot of Australians think it's overdone and it cheapens the significance of what it was meant to do. It divides the country, not dissimilar to what the Prime Minister did with the Voice.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said it's up to individual organisations whether they hold Welcome to Country ceremonies, saying he sees them as being about respect.\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 11 people have died in Vancouver, after a car drove into a crowd at a Filipino festival In Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 30-year-old man has been taken into custody.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Filipino community had gathered to celebrate the Lapu Lapu Festival that honours their Indigenous leader Datu Lapu-Lapu, who fought against Spanish colonisation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMable Elmore is the first Filipino elected as Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the community is shattered by what's happened.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our community is grieving. I'm heartbroken. We're in incredible pain. The Filipino community will show true resilience. And we will come together out of this catastrophe. I also want to say that I encourage everyone who has been impacted. Please reach out. Talk to your friends and family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nCanadians head to the polls today in an election that has been overshadowed by the fallout from U-S President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe election was called earlier than expected, after former leader of the governing Liberal Party, Justin Trudeau, stepped down as his popularity slumped.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Trudeau was replaced by former banker Mark Carney, who helped his party gain a narrow lead over the conservative opposition after becoming PM.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince then, the polls have tightened to become neck-and-neck, with Mr Carney campaigning on imposing tariffs in response to those imposed by Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is a time for serious leadership. It's time to come together and unite as a country because we need to fight, we need to protect, and we need build. We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter-tariffs of our own that cause maximum damage in the United States with minimum impact here.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael has struck the southern suburbs of Lebanon's capital Beirut in the latest violation of a November ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\n\n\n\n\nA huge plume of smoke rose above the city skyline as firefighting trucks and Lebanese soldiers were deployed to the site.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was no immediate information on casualties.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Israeli army says it struck the southern Beirut building because it believed it was being used to store precision missiles belonging to Hezbollah - but they have so far not provided evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is the third Israeli strike on Beirut since the late November ceasefire.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal resident Hussein al-Mokdad says the situation has become intolerable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm here, 50 metres away from the strike, this is the second time that we leave home, with our children and family.

It's a trend he hopes continues in 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That will continue because people are fed up with the major parties. They want alternatives,\" he said.\n\n\n\nWhat does the Trumpet of Patriots stand for?\n\nAccording to its website, the party's key policies are:\n\n\n\nLaunch an investigation into wasteful government spending;\n\nCut immigration;\n\nAllow Australians to use their superannuation to buy housing and cap interest rates at 3 per cent;\n\nRepeal the ban on nuclear energy;\n\nExit the Paris Agreement on climate change action;\n\nGet the 'woke agenda' out of schools;\n\nHigh-speed rail;\n\nWithdraw from global organisations such as the World Health Organization and United Nations; and\n\nPlace a 15 per cent licence fee on all iron ore exports from Australia.\n\nTrumpet of Patriots chairman Clive Palmer at the party's campaign launch on 19 April. Source: AAP / Danny Casey\n\nControversy over adverts\n\nIn recent weeks the party has also caused controversy over its election advertisements, spending on which Palmer says has already reached $60 million.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the party's YouTube videos, which questions climate change and uses footage from a documentary, has been described as misleading because the footage was taken more than 20 years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nA newspaper advert stating \"there are only two genders \u2014 male and female\" was also removed from the online edition of the Newcastle Herald after causing controversy.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline ads stating \"We don't need to be welcomed to our own country\" were also run on the same day that booing during a Welcome to Country was reported at an Anzac Day service in Melbourne.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Party Time: The Players SBS News 10/04/2025 29:05 Play\n\nClive Palmer 'wants to help people'\n\nThe controversies have not impacted Loke's support for Palmer and his party.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are a lot of misconceptions. I would like to say Clive is a really good person. I have met Clive,\" Loke said of the party's leader.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He could just sit there in his mansion and do nothing, but he wants to help people.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLoke also explained that while the party name references US President Donald Trump, the Trumpet of Patriots does not take his policies.\n\n\n\nIf you look at our policies, they're different. But if Clive likes Trump, there's nothing wrong with it. [Trump's] trying to mediate to stop the war in Ukraine and Russia.\n\n\"So there are some good things that Trump is doing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe added that he personally was not totally against or for Trump's policy decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the party's website, the cost of living is high as Australians are \"being ripped off\" by the political system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the USA, government waste and corruption is finally being exposed. For too long, Australians have suffered from a Labor and Liberal duopoly of power supported by the Greens and now the Teals,\" it reads.\n\n\n\nPalmer says he is not worried about being compared to Trump and vowed the party would \"make Australia great again\", referencing Trump's campaign slogan.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has also defended the party's candidate in the seat of Dickson (currently held by Opposition leader Peter Dutton), who is on bail for stalking and weapons charges.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We believe that everybody's innocent until they're proven guilty,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the Trumpet of Patriots launch earlier this year, Palmer said the major parties were too focused on arguing over tax cuts and ignoring homeless people and those going hungry.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe has pledged $90 million to campaigning and is fielding more than a hundred candidates across the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n\n\n'I would come to your house ... to help'\n\nLoke came to Australia from India in 1999, saying he had only $500 to his name and limited support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Twenty years back, I came to Australia with nothing. If I'm elected, I would like to be more accessible than the current MP,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would come to your house if you have any issue to help you. That's what I want to change.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince emigrating, Loke has started an IT training business and manages a film production company.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a candidate, his priorities are to bring down the cost of living, improve access to healthcare and reduce immigration.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe also values entrepreneurship, which is a trait he admires in Palmer.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "In just three decades, the Greens have transformed from what was essentially an environmental protest movement to Australia's third largest party by vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the 2022 election, the federal Australian Greens secured 12.2 per cent of the primary vote \u2014 an almost 2 per cent increase from the party's primary vote in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens are looking to achieve even greater success on 3 May , capitalising on the bloc of generally more progressive Gen Z and millennial voters, who outnumber baby boomers for the first time this election.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs thousands flock to pre-polling centres, Greens leader Adam Bandt says the party is feeling confident.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're getting a terrific response on the doors, the streets and the polling booths to our plan to get dental and mental health into Medicare, finally tackle the housing and rental crisis, make child care free, and stop opening up new coal and gas mines in the middle of a climate crisis,\" the member for Melbourne says.\n\n\n\nWhat are the Greens' main policies?\n\nProfessor Rodney Smith from the University of Sydney says the Greens have been able to position themselves quite successfully as an alternative for disenchanted Labor voters who are looking for a more solid, leftist, or progressive policy package.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey promises from the Greens include:\n\n\n\nCancelling all student HECS debt;\n\nExpanding Medicare to cover dental;\n\nBanning new coal and gas projects; and\n\nIntroducing higher taxes on billionaires and big corporations.\n\nGreens leader Adam Bandt outside Melbourne's Luna Park earlier this month. The Greens have long campaigned for dental treatment to be covered by Medicare. Source: AAP / Nadir Kinani On the campaign trail, the party has also pledged to make HIV prevention medications PrEP and PEP free \u2014 a policy announced on the adult social media site OnlyFans , in a headline-grabbing move by Brisbane MP Stephen Bates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey've also unveiled a national plan to provide free school meals.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Greens MP Max Chandler-Mather, the party's housing and homelessness spokesperson, says housing is the \"defining issue\" of the election.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party has put forward its own measures to tackle the housing crisis, including discounted mortgage rates and capping rents.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will also scrap negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount for investors with more than one property.\n\n\n\n(From left) Ryan MP Elizabeth Watson-Brown, Greens leader Adam Bandt, Griffith MP Max Chandler-Mather and Brisbane MP Stephen Bates. Source: SBS News \"There's certainly a lot of people voting Greens for the first time in their lives because we're the only party with policies to make housing affordable,\" Mather says.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany voters have also voiced frustration with the major parties' handling of international issues, particularly the conflict in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Greens have taken a firm stance, pledging to continue calling for an end to the occupation of Palestinian territories and urging Israel to halt what they describe as an ongoing genocide in Gaza, a description backed by several prominent international organisations but repeatedly denied by Israel .\n\n\n\nHow powerful are the Greens?\n\nJill Sheppard, a professor of Australian Politics at the Australian National University, says the Greens' popularity in the Senate is particularly important.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Greens can't form government on their own, their policies are more an indication of how party members may vote on legislation, she says, and the number of seats they secure will determine how much power they'll wield over legislation in the upper house.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Although we focus on the House of Representatives, particularly around an election because that's where government is won and lost, the Senate is still really important for passing legislation after the election,\" Sheppard says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There, the Greens have held the balance of power for quite a while. They are very experienced Senate negotiators, and so even if they are sidelined in some kind of independent-Labor minority government, they will still be strong in the upper house.\"\n\n\n\nPolls suggest the Greens are likely to retain the five Senate seats they are contesting in this election, meaning it's likely the party will retain its powerful 11-seat upper house voting bloc.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has insisted he won't do a deal with the Greens to form government if Labor fails to win a majority.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has frequently raised the prospect of a Labor-Greens alliance as a point of concern for voters, pointing out that the Greens and Labor usually recommend that voters put the other party in the second position on how-to-vote cards.\n\n\n\n\n\nSheppard says that, if Labor falls short of the 76 seats it needs for a majority, it will likely first look to independents to form government.\n\n\n\n\"They probably feel like they can work with [Independents] more easily ... without offering the Greens a spot in cabinet, which would be about the worst-case scenario for the ALP,\" Sheppard says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The major parties want you to think that a hung parliament is bad because they desperately want majority government for themselves. But a hung parliament isn't bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We saw between 2010 and 2013 a minority government last the full term quite successfully.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBandt has said that seeking a ministerial position would not be a priority for the party in the event of a hung parliament.\n\n\n\nThe Greens' relationship with Labor\n\nThe relationship between the Greens and Labor has also been fraught with tension, with both parties fighting to capture votes on the left side of politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"At the national level, the relationship between the Greens and Labor has never been a particularly happy one,\" Smith says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Initially, it was because there was a tension between Labor's union base and many of the environmental concerns and policies of the Greens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"More recently, it's had to do with that trend of left voters moving their support away from the Labor Party to the Greens, and the Greens using their position to pressure Labor to shift its legislative agenda in a more progressive direction.\"\n\n\n\n'They didn't see us coming'\n\nThe Greens are defending their record number of lower house seats, three of which turned Green for the first time at the last election, shocking both major parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three were inner-city Brisbane electorates. Griffith was won from Labor, while Brisbane and Ryan flipped from the Liberal National Party.\n\n\n\n\n\nRyan, once considered a rock-solid Liberal seat, is now a key battleground the Coalition is determined to reclaim.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The LNP thinks they own that seat.

Source: SBS News Naji, who is the daughter of Palestinian refugees and grew up in Jordan before moving to Australia 12 years ago, also points to the Palestinian territories being a key issue, especially among the 7,000 Muslim voters in the electorate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're traditionally Labor voters and they're switching to the Greens,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nElsewhere in the country, the Greens have their eyes on five other electorates.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are the safe Labor seats of Wills and Macnamara in Victoria, as well as Richmond in NSW and Perth in WA.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso in their sights is the marginal Liberal seat of Sturt, South Australia.\n\n\n\nSheppard says the Greens are targeting seats with specific voter demographics, seeking to emulate their success in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe points to the Greens success in the seat of Ryan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ryan has a really nice mix for the Greens of university students who are frustrated about job security, housing security, and concerned about the environment,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"[It also has] wealthier people who are a little bit older, who have job security, quite a lot of wealth \u2014 and they are worried about the kinds of issues that affect their grandchildren, like access to education, health and climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's that concentration of wealthy boomers and Gen X voters, alongside university students, that makes Ryan so perfect.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "One of the world\u2019s biggest credit ratings agencies, S&P Global, has put the major parties on notice that Australia could lose its triple A credit rating if their election promises result in larger structural budget deficits.\n\nIn a statement this morning, the agency said sound budget management had underpinned Australia\u2019s triple A rating for years. Change in net general government debt \u2014 which includes the federal and state governments \u2014 had averaged just 2 per cent of gross domestic product since the global financial crisis of 2008-09.\n\nTreasurer Dr Jim Chalmers during a doorstop interview following the final leaders\u2019 debate. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nBut S&P believes growing risks to the global economy, plus the use by both parties of off-budget commitments to meet their spending pledges, was putting the budget at risk.\n\n\u201cThe budget is already regressing to moderate deficits as public spending hits post-war highs, global trade tensions intensify and growth slows,\u201d it said, \u201chow the elected government funds its campaign pledges and rising spending will be crucial for maintaining the rating.\u201d\n\nAccording to the agency, \u201clax fiscal discipline at the state level\u201d \u2013 of the states and territories, only WA has a triple-A rating \u2013 on top of the turmoil created by Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war and growing demands in federally supported areas such as the NDIS, defence, health and aged care would likely increase general government deficits.\n\n\u201cIf major election commitments aren\u2019t funded via additional revenues or savings, the deficit could widen further,\u201d it said.\n\nLoading\n\nAnother concern raised by the agency is the use of off-budget items for major spending. The Albanese government has created several, such as its $19 billion Rewiring the Nation Fund and its $10 billion Housing Australia Fund.\n\nPeter Dutton is promising to axe both of these funds, but has promised to create his own Regional Australia Future Fund and a Future Generations Fund.\n\nS&P said the use of these funds was \u201cincreasingly obfuscating Australia\u2019s fiscal position and borrowing needs\u201d. In the March 25 budget, Treasurer Jim Chalmers forecast a deficit of $27.6 billion for the current financial year, widening to $42.1 billion in 2025-26. The budget is expected to remain in deficit for the rest of the decade and well into the 2030s.",

        "text": "Loading The International Energy Agency had forecast that demand for oil would increase about 1.03 million barrels a day. After Liberation Day it cut that forecast by about a third, to 730,000 barrels a day, saying about half that reduction was attributable to lower demand in the US and China as a result of the trade war. Demand is, of course, only half of the equation that generates prices. The other half is supply, and it is increasing even as demand is falling. On the day Trump unveiled his new tariffs, OPEC+ said they would unwind the 6 million barrels a day or so of cuts they have made over the past three years at a faster pace than they had previously planned, adding about 411,000 barrels a day to supply from next month. The move is seen as an attempt by Saudi Arabia, which has borne the brunt of the past cuts to production, to punish those members of the cartel that haven\u2019t met their own commitments to constrain their production. Kazakhstan, the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Iraq have all been producing above their agreed caps.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cGolden Age\u201d for US oil \u2013 he has said he wants to double US oil production, which reached record levels during the Biden administration \u2013 is not going to happen if demand weakens even as supply increases. He may get the other thing he wished for \u2013 lower US gasoline prices \u2013 but for less palatable reasons than the giant surge in US production he anticipated. The US shale sector is unlikely to take any heed of his urgings to \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d while domestic oil prices are languishing at their current levels. While break-even levels for shale producers vary according to the richness and productivity of the various basins, a rough guide is that to break even \u2013 pay all costs, including operating and financing costs and also pay a dividend \u2013 US onshore oil companies need a price of between $US62 and $US65 a barrel. Today, however, it isn\u2019t just the oil price that dictates whether they drill wells or not. Drilling rigs require lots of steel and there are also many components imported from China. Trump\u2019s steel tariffs and his 145 per cent tariff on most imports from China are driving up the sector\u2019s costs.\n\nToday\u2019s shale industry has been heavily consolidated and is financially disciplined, with a focus on returns on capital. Where once Wall Street rewarded shale oil and gas companies for their production, now it rewards them for their returns on capital and punishes sub-optimal activity. Loading According to energy technology company Baker-Hughes, there are about 23 fewer oil rigs operating today than there were a year ago and, at 483, only just over half the record number of rigs \u2013888 \u2013 set in 2018. Industry executives are warning that if prices fall back further, the number of operating rigs will fall much further. With the best fields\u2019 reserves declining and costs increasing, the US shale sector was never going to double its production. While production was expected to continue to grow incrementally, peak production was expected to occur before the end of the decade, although Trump\u2019s deregulation and opening of federal lands to exploration and drilling might have stretched the timeline.\n\nA US and, perhaps, global recession would, of course, further darken the outlook for demand and undermine the economics of production. While those recessions are not yet seen as probable, both the IMF\u2019s odds on a US recession and those of private forecasters have been shortening. The risk of a severe downturn in the economy adds another layer of uncertainty to the outlook for US energy companies, as does the potential for Trump to do a deal with Vladimir Putin that would lift the sanctions on Russian oil (Russian drilling has already begun increasing in anticipation) and add to the global surplus of supply. Early this month, Trump\u2019s energy secretary, Chris Wright, told the Financial Times that the shale producers could boost their output even at $US50 a barrel. Less than a fortnight later he said $US50 a barrel oil wasn\u2019t sustainable for producers. Wright, before taking up the role in the administration, was chief executive of Denver-based Liberty Energy \u2013 America\u2019s second-biggest \u201cfracker\u201d \u2013 which earlier this month announced a first-quarter profit of $US20 million, down from $US82 million in the same quarter last year and the $US52 million it earned in the December quarter last year. Liberty\u2019s share price was around $US22.60 when Trump took office again. Today\u2019s it\u2019s just over $US12. The company\u2019s market capitalisation has slumped from $US3.7 billion to $US1.97 billion over that period.\n\nLoading The current chief executive, Ron Gusek, believes that producers can maintain their drilling at current levels as long as the price remains in the low $US60s a barrel but are likely to start shutting down wells if the prices dropped any further. Maybe he had a chat with Wright, although the precipitous fall in his old company\u2019s share price might also have grabbed Wright\u2019s attention. Trump\u2019s \u201cbabies\u201d aren\u2019t going to increase their drilling and production at current prices. At best they will, regardless of his urgings, try to maintain current levels. At worst? Trump\u2019s tariffs, a US and global economic slowdown/recession and rising production volumes from OPEC+ will result in production cuts to a sector that generated more than 15 per cent of America\u2019s exports last year and gave the country a $US45 billion energy surplus. The billionaire donors to Trump\u2019s campaign should, perhaps, have been more careful of what they wished for, looking beyond his energy and tax policies to his wider platform, and the trade policies in particular.",

        "text": "Consider a missive sent out to NRL coaches ahead of round 8. It warned against a minor breach of \u201cswitching halves\u201d \u2013 that is, the practice of the man about to feed a scrum, placing the ball quickly on the ground, then racing to take a place as first receiver in the backline, while another player detaches from the scrum, picks up the ball and feeds it into the scrum. Insofar as teams are not permitted to have more than seven backs at a scrum, this is a breach.\n\nAnother warning related to non-warnings \u2013 that is, referees are not obligated to issue a caution ahead of sin-binning a player. Then followed a list of sins such as \u201cescorts\u201d, \u201cflops\u201d, \u201crolled ball\u201d, \u201cstripping\u201d, and marker depth.\n\nThese are not called crackdowns but \u201cfocus\u201d areas, as in the line to clubs from NRL referees coach, David Fairleigh ahead of round 7: \u201cYou can expect the referee to have a higher focus on this area.\u201d Then followed injunctions against \u201ccontact on the kicker\u201d, \u201claying in the ruck\u201d, \u201cflops\u201d and \u201cchecking of gear\u201d.\n\nBut note that in these two missives, there is no warning of action against high tackles, despite round 8 producing a historic high 18 sin bins, 15 for contact with the head. That warning came after round 4 when NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo conceded officials had missed four high tackles where they should have sent players to the sin bin. NRL headquarters subsequently sent a memo to clubs warning of an increased incidence of \u201cshoulder to the head\u201d contact.\n\nIn the Penrith v Manly match, Sharpe penalised a Sea Eagles player for this offence but his captain challenged it and the bunker agreed. While some will say Sharpe got it wrong, the NRL will argue that video referee Ashley Klein got it right when he over-ruled her. Furthermore, headquarters will contend the recent action against high tackles is not so much an over-reaction, as it was with the plethora of penalties in magic round 2021, but a \u201ccorrection\u201d to the incidents in round 4.",

        "text": "In France, child beauty salons, much like Moony\u2019s, are opening at pace and finding themselves booked for months. In the States, the Sephora hashtag caught on after social media reported growing numbers of kids flocking to the stores, although Sephora itself makes it clear it does not put on make-over events. (A spokesperson says the company \u201cdoes not offer a formal party programme for customers of any age\u201d in the UK, and stresses that \u201cchildren under 16 cannot sign up for or receive a beauty service without the permission and attendance of a parent.\u201d) Nevertheless, children\u2019s appetite for beauty products seems insatiable. Data from market research company NielsenIQ (NIQ) found US consumers under the age of 14 drove 49 per cent of drug store skincare sales in 2023. TikTok has a lot to do with it, say parents. Dewy-skinned children \u2013 many not yet teenagers \u2013 beam into their cameras demonstrating make-up and carefully curated beauty routines. The hashtag #GRWM \u2013 Get Ready With Me \u2013 has billions of views. Kim Kardashian\u2019s 11-year-old daughter North West, whose joint account with her mother has 19.3 million followers, is an icon of these so-called \u201cskinfluencers\u201d. The Garza Crew (@garzacrew) with five million followers is another, and features a mum and her pre-tween twins from Oklahoma posting avidly.\n\nData from Statista reveals the baby and child skincare market is expected to experience a yearly rise of around 7.71 percent from now until 2028, when it will reach \u00a3299 million in market volume worldwide. Popular products with children include the brand Drunk Elephant. Slaai Makeup-Melting Butter Cleanser retails at \u00a337 ($AU77). \u201cNot every product in our line should be used by younger fans, 12 and under,\u201d the website small print warns. Even Christian Dior has launched a Baby Dior skincare collection. Alcohol-free Bonne \u00c9toile Scented Water retails at \u00a3230 ($AU479). Back in Havant, the birthday girl, five, is only concerned with one brand: Disney. Her outfit incorporates a yellow \u201cBelle\u201d dress and sparkly blue \u201cElsa\u201d shoes. She giggles as her hair is brushed because it tickles, and selects a \u201cdo\u201d from a picture menu. Coloured bands and glitter sit next to a very large can of \u201cultra strong power hold\u201d hair spray. From the array of make-up, it\u2019s the zany colours and glitter sticks that are chosen, but there are BB cream bases, mascaras, and blushers too, which I\u2019m advised are for older children. At the nail bar I\u2019m told the polishes are all child-friendly and peel off. The young customers exclaim when they feel the heat of the dryer, but bear with it with a surprisingly mature perseverance \u2013 albeit singing along to the Hokey Cokey.\n\nThe birthday girl\u2019s dad says her love of beauty has \u201cbeen more of a thing in the last year or so\u201d. \u201cShe just loves princesses,\u201d he says. \u201cBut she\u2019ll still make horrible faces and some days just wants to wear what she\u2019s picked off the floor.\u201d Loading Wanting to wear make-up like a grown-up is perhaps nothing new. But there\u2019s a shift at Moony\u2019s second party of the day, for an 11-year-old, her nine-year-old sister, and their 11-year-old friend. They\u2019re having facials and foot spas, and taking it seriously. They\u2019re each presented with a mirror and a range of cosmetics. First, they\u2019re instructed to cleanse their faces \u2013 I\u2019m assured it\u2019s water they\u2019re using \u2013 and then move on to jade stone facial rollers, yoghurt and cucumber face masks, and moisturiser, which I\u2019m told is emollient cream, suitable for babies. They stare intensely at their reflections as they sing along to Taylor Swift. After a quick face \u201cmist\u201d they are ushered to pink armchairs for brightly coloured \u201cjelly foot spas\u201d. No one can tell me what\u2019s in this, but it looks like slime.\n\nThe girls \u2013 one shows me the fake eyelashes she\u2019s wearing, a weekend treat \u2013 sigh as they sink their pale feet in. This is self-care, they say. The birthday girl\u2019s mother explains she wanted to give her daughter the party she craved, but is candid about her worries. \u201cShe\u2019s always on TikTok, and wants to use the new face serums, wear make-up at weekends,\u201d she says, adding that she insists on buying all her daughter\u2019s products and ensuring they\u2019re gentle. Her younger daughter has expressed concerns about her appearance. \u201cI tell her she\u2019s beautiful and too young (to worry),\u201d she says. Tessa Stevens, 49, is a skincare expert of 32 years. Over the past 18 months, she has received a growing number of enquiries about treatments like facials for children, but declines if they\u2019re under 12. Over 12, she will usually only consider a consultation if they have a skin condition, such as acne. \u201cI believe there is room for services in beauty clinics for our younger generation,\u201d she says. \u201cBut this should be very limited. And it should always start with an in-depth consultation, which should include the parent, guardian or carer. Teaching them how to take care of their skin and reassuring them the changes they are going through are very normal.\u201d\n\nTweens and teenage girls have long indulged in makeup and beauty treatments but the age group is now trending younger. Credit: Getty Images Many products aren\u2019t appropriate for younger kids, she says, especially those containing salicylic acids, vitamin A and hyaluronic acid, trendy on TikTok. \u201cWhy a 10-year-old needs to use hyaluronic acid [popular for its anti-ageing properties] is beyond me,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir skin\u2019s an organ and it can\u2019t tolerate those types of ingredients or daily exposure. It\u2019s not developed properly yet. You can cause long-term damage.\u201d She\u2019s not against playful hair and make-up, but believes the environment of a salon, psychologically, isn\u2019t appropriate for a young child. \u201cWe don\u2019t need children to direct their thought process onto the way they\u2019re looking,\u201d she says. \u201cMy daughter is nine and she doesn\u2019t even know what Sephora is.\u201d She admits she has allowed her to attend a pamper party to join her friends, but they spoke about how it \u201cwasn\u2019t for everyday\u201d. Tai was inspired by her own daughters, aged two and six, who adore beauty. \u201cGrowing up nowadays is so different,\u201d she says. She hosts around five to six parties every weekend. Boys come too, although it\u2019s primarily girls. She researches her products and emphasises the relaxation and bonding benefits of pampering, and the \u201cplayfulness\u201d.",

Change in net general government debt \u2013 which includes the federal and state governments \u2013 had averaged just 2 per cent of GDP since the global financial crisis of 2008-09.\n\nTreasurer Dr Jim Chalmers during a doorstop interview following the final leaders\u2019 debate. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nBut S&P believes growing risks to the global economy, plus the use by both parties of off-budget commitments to meet their spending pledges, was putting the budget under risk.\n\n\u201cThe budget is already regressing to moderate deficits as public spending hits post-war highs, global trade tensions intensify, and growth slows,\u201d it said, \u201chow the elected government funds its campaign pledges and rising spending will be crucial for maintaining the rating.\u201d",

        "text": "A young couple renting in Frankston North paid $900,500 for a family home in the suburb at a heated auction on Saturday, beating eight other bidders, including four investors from New South Wales.\n\nThe four-bedroom property at 10-11 Timbertop Court drew a crowd of about 75 people.\n\nIt was listed with a price guide of between $700,000 and $770,000. The reserve was set within that range, though the exact figure was not disclosed.\n\nSituated on a 1126-square-metre block, the home attracted a range of other bidders, including a mix of first-home buyers and downsizers.",
