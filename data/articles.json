        "text": "Laine Bradley was just 10 months old when she contracted the measles - too young to be vaccinated.\n\nHer mother, Cecily Johnson, had taken her on a trip from Western Australia to Sydney.\n\n\"I didn't know there was an outbreak. If I had known I would had have had her immunised early,\" Johnson said.\n\nLaine Bradley contracted measles as a baby during a trip to Sydney. (Supplied)\n\nWhen the pair returned to Western Australia, little Laine broke out in a rash.\n\nAs a paediatric nurse, her mother immediately recognised the signs of measles.\n\nAfter a few grizzly days of being unwell, Laine recovered.\n\n\"She was fine and over it. She had no real problems. I never thought any more of it until she was seven,\" Johnson said.\n\nIt was at that age when Johnson began to think something was wrong with her daughter, but it was hard to pinpoint what exactly.\n\nLaine was naturally smart and bright girl, who even taught her brother to read and write before he went to school.\n\n\"One day she said to me, 'I can't go to school anymore. I feel dumb',\" Johnson said.\n\n\"That's when I went, oh my God, there's something wrong here.\"\n\nLaine began to show signs of confusion.\n\n\"I would say, 'Oh, come on, have a shower.' And she would answer, 'Where's the shower?'\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson said she took Laine to multiple doctors and had her seen at the hospital, but everyone told her there was nothing wrong with her daughter.\n\nIt was only when Johnson desperately appealed for help from a specialist doctor she knew that she got some answers.\n\n\"He said one thing: 'Did she have measles as a baby?'\" Johnson said.\n\nCecily Johnson with her daughter Laine when she was ill with the measles. (Supplied)\n\nLaine was diagnosed with Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare and fatal neurological disorder caused by the measles virus she contracted as an infant.\n\nWithin two weeks of her diagnosis Laine went blind, and then lost the ability to walk or speak.\n\nLaine hung on for five more years, but for much of that time she was completely bedridden and unable to do anything for herself.\n\nShe died when she was 12 in 1995.\n\nDuring Laine's illness and after her death, Johnson began sharing her story, raising important awareness about SSPE, measles and the importance of immunisation.\n\n\"If more people knew that having measles isn't just having a rash getting over it, that kids can die with it, they would make sure their kids were vaccinated,\" Johnson said.\n\nSpeaking out has made Johnson a target of anti-vaxxers who do not care to hear her message.\n\nIn an appalling move, a group of anti-vaxxers even showed up at Laine's funeral, Jonhson said, adding police officers were needed to escort them away.\n\n\"They were yelling, 'She didn't die of that, it's something else. She's a liar.'\"\n\nJohnson has had to put aside her feelings about people who oppose vaccinations when she helps children with SSPE through a support group.\n\n\"I've helped anti vaxxers when their kids have gotten ill. I put it all away, and I think of the child,\" Johnson said.\n\nWhile anti-vaccination sentiment had waxed and waned over the decades since Laine's death, Johnson said she had noticed a marked uptick since the pandemic.\n\nShe has noticed it particularly with her interactions online.\n\n\"I just had a guy laugh at Laine's photo, a dead child's photo,\" she said.\n\n\"I have to go past all the comments because they will break my heart.\"\n\nCecily Johnson nursed her daughter for 5 years before she passed away. (Supplied)\n\nJohnson is sharing Laine's story again as Australia is experiencing the highest number if measles cases in six years.\n\nSo far this year, there have been 137 cases of measles, federal health records show.\n\nThe last peak before then was back in 2019, when 284 were recorded for the full year.\n\nOn Thursday, Queensland Health issued a measles alert for South East Queensland after several cases were reported, including a school student.\n\nEarlier this month, multiple alerts have been issued across Queensland and Western Australia stemming from infected travellers returning from Bali.\n\nMeasles was considered to have been eradicated in Australia in 2014, when The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared Australia free of the disease.\n\nAustralia's thorough childhood vaccination program has largely kept any subsequent outbreaks to a minimum over the intervening years.\n\nMeasles is one of the most contagious human diseases and WHO recommends at least 95 percent of the total population receive two doses of the measles vaccine in childhood to achieve \"herd immunity\".\n\nIn Australia, doses of the measles vaccine are given at 12 months and 18 months.\n\nLeading up to the pandemic, Australia had its highest level of vaccination rates ever, with 94.85 percent of 1-year-old children fully vaccinated and 92.55 percent of two-year-olds.\n\nHowever, since the pandemic that number has been steadily declining.\n\nIn 2024, there were 92.14 percent of 1-year-old's fully vaccinated and 90.44 percent of 2-year-olds.\n\nWriting in a joint piece for The Conversation last month, University of Sydney's public health associate professor Frank Beard and Katherine Macartney, a professor of Paediatrics and Child Health at the same university, said the trend was concerning.\n\n\"In terms of overall herd immunity, the impacts at this stage may be relatively small. But measles immunity gaps are much greater in some parts of Australia, such as the north coast of New South Wales and the Gold Coast in Queensland,\" the pair wrote.\n\n\"Measles immunity is also lower in some adults, because vaccination rates were lower when they were children. A second dose of measles vaccine was not added to the National Immunisation Program until 1992.\"\n\nAustralia is not the only country to see increased rates of measles. In the US, cases of measles are at their highest level since 2000, when the disease was declared eliminated there.\n\n\"Amid a global resurgence of measles and more cases in travellers, supporting international efforts to boost immunisation rates in all countries is critical. This will further reduce the chance of outbreaks here,\" Beard and Macartney said.",

        "text": "Have you heard how The Rocks precinct in Sydney was nearly demolished in the 1960s and 70s?\n\nIt boggles the mind to think about it.\n\nThat historic precinct is the pride of Sydneysiders today. It's one of the things that makes the city special.\n\nWalk its streets, and visit its old pubs built from local stone, and you'll travel back in time to Sydney's colonial beginnings.\n\nBut watch this short video from 1967 to see what city planners of that era had in mind for the area.\n\nIt was pure vandalism.\n\nAs the voiceover in the video acknowledges: \"The Rocks area is as old as Sydney itself. Part of the city's earliest history.\"\n\nYet the wisdom of 1960s planners determined that the area should be bulldozed to \"beautify\" it.\n\nThe redevelopment plans wanted to exploit the area's prime waterfront real estate. (Supplied: The Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority)\n\nSo why didn't The Rocks get demolished?\n\nIn recent years, we've heard a lot of talk about the NIMBY movement (Not In My Backyard) and the YIMBY movement (Yes In My Backyard) in our national debate about our housing affordability problems.\n\nBut let's remember what Australia's cities looked like before both of those movements existed.\n\nWhat's driving Australia's YIMBYs? The relatively new YIMBY movement is beginning to make an impact.\n\nIn Sydney in the early 1960s, architects like Harry Seidler were calling for the historic Queen Victoria Building in the CBD to be torn down.\n\nThey wanted to replace it with a \"civic square\" and underground parking station.\n\n\"It is an architectural monstrosity, a wasteful, stupid building,\" Seidler said (according to the Daily Mirror in 1961).\n\nThat type of attitude was extremely common towards our historic buildings.\n\nThe Rocks was another target.\n\nPoliticians and developers in the 1960s wanted to bulldoze the suburb to exploit its prime waterfront real estate.\n\nBut their plans were thwarted by the \"green bans\" movement.\n\nThe opinion of a famous economist\n\nWhat were the \"green bans\"?\n\nIn 1975, when the radical free market American economist Milton Friedman came to Australia for a speaking tour (his trip was organised by Maurice Newman), he made this observation about a local social movement he'd heard about:\n\n\"In my opinion unions do a great deal of harm,\" he told a Sydney audience. \"They do a great deal of harm in my country and I assume your country is no different [...] \"I have come across a new one in this country called 'green bans' which seems to me an excellent example of the kind of harm which is done by arbitrary private power.\"\n\nArbitrary private power? That statement was severely dismissive of democratic life.\n\nIt's worth unpacking.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Sydney was experiencing a building boom.\n\nJack Mundey dies aged 90 Veteran unionist Jack Mundey, who was best known for orchestrating the green bans across Sydney in the 1970s, dies aged 90. He was credited with stopping several developments at The Rocks.\n\nIt was being transformed from a city of low-rise buildings with a 45-metre height limit (imposed in 1912), to one in which skyscrapers were suddenly allowed to pierce the sky.\n\nDevelopers and building companies had dollar signs in their eyes after new planning laws stripped the rights of tenants and gave developers more power.\n\nThe enormous height of buildings introduced new dangerous work practices, and many workers were being killed.\n\nAnd residents were becoming so frustrated with governments rushing ahead with bulldozers to demolish historic urban and green areas of the city, without listening to the concerns of locals, that they sought help from the NSW Builders Labourers Federation (BLF).\n\nMany of the BLF's workers could have found work on the big redevelopments.\n\nBut the BLF's leadership, led by people like Jack Mundey, Joe Owens, and Bob Pringle, were starting to talk about a \"new concept of unionism,\" arguing that workers had the right to insist that their labour couldn't be used in harmful ways.\n\nIn 2005, Mundey recalled what was happening to the city:\n\n\"Buildings that were part of our heritage were being knocked down, there was no legislation, there were no acts of parliament to stop buildings being destroyed. \"At the beginning of the boom there was a tendency to say 'This is good, bigger is better, biggest is best, we are going to become another Chicago, New York, we are going to reach for the sky.' \"But others of the more thinking segment said, 'Well come on, is this good? Look what's happening. These fine buildings are being knocked down and people are not being consulted'.\"\n\nThe green ban on Kelly's Bush\n\nThe idea of \"green bans\" emerged in that context.\n\nIn 1971, in a small wealthy suburb called Hunters Hill, on a peninsula of land that juts into Sydney Harbour on the lower north shore, a group of local women had been campaigning to protect a tiny patch of bushland on the peninsula, called Kelly's Bush.\n\nA developer, AV Jennings, had bought the land in the late 1960s and planned to build luxury units and apartments on the site.\n\nKelly's Bush at Hunters Hill. (ABC News: Fletcher Yeung)\n\nThe women had fought for years to save the bushland, raising concerns with the local council, the mayor, their local State MP, and the NSW government led by the Liberal Premier Bob Askin. But their pleas fell on deaf ears.\n\nOut of desperation, they turned to the BLF for help. And it changed the course of Sydney's history.\n\nThe BLF stopped the development from going ahead, and it led to more local resident groups popping up around the city and asking the BLF to help them protect other green spaces and historic buildings.\n\nThe union would help if the resident groups could demonstrate that they had widespread community support.\n\nAs Mundey recalled in 2005 again:\n\n\"We were inundated with requests for the green bans and our success was always that, even though we were being accused by Askin and the developers of flexing our muscles and being power-drunk and imposing green bans, we always set a pattern that the residents had to come to us, or the people opposing construction of a new development had to come to us, or people opposing demolition of buildings had to come to us. \"We would then go and talk to either mass meetings, or executive meetings of the Builders\u2019 Labourers, and then a ban would be imposed. That was the pattern we followed and that won us credibility [...] \"The bans were very different in some ways because some of the bans were against any development taking place, other bans were for residents and architects and others to have a say in modifying buildings that [were] taking place, others were just a blanket ban because of the heritage regulation and a call that governments should be introducing legislation so as to allow ordinary people to have a say in what should happen.\"\n\nThe net result was significant.\n\nThe green bans eventually helped to change officials' attitudes towards historic buildings and green urban spaces, leading to a change in legislation and planning rules.\n\nThe NSW Heritage Act was established in 1977, followed by the NSW Land and Environment Court in 1980.\n\nInside Arthur King's abduction After his abduction, Arthur left the fight to save his Kings Cross street. Juanita Nielsen\u2019s murder brought him back.\n\nSome of the precincts, green spaces, and buildings in Sydney that were saved by green bans included The Rocks, Woolloomooloo, Centennial Park and Moore Park, and Pitt Street Uniting Church.\n\nThere was a huge list of areas that were protected.\n\nAnd it wasn't easy. Some developers resorted to extreme violence to crush some green bans, with police support.\n\nA green ban imposed on Victoria Street in King's Cross in the early 1970s led to the disappearance (and suspected murder) of Juanita Nielsen, a young local journalist, in 1975. Nielsen's neighbour, a young man called Arthur King, was abducted by henchmen for two days. One of the many suspicious house fires that occurred on that street in that period killed a young indigenous woman, Esther George.\n\nBut similar green bans, inspired by Sydney's, sprang up around Australia.\n\nAnd in The Rocks in the early 1970s, locals drew up a People's Plan for the precinct, detailing their ideas for how the area could absorb new development while maintaining the area's historic character.\n\nAs Meredith Burgmann and Verity Burgmann wrote in 2011, regarding that movement in The Rocks:\n\n\"By the 1990s, the Ministry for Planning admitted that the green ban had resulted in the plans for the area being 'an overwhelming success', reflected in the millions of tourists who visit the historic area each year.\"\n\nDid the unions do harm?\n\nSo what should one make of Milton Friedman's claim that Australia's green bans were another example of the \"harm\" that unions do to society?\n\nDo we think Sydney would be a better city without The Rocks?\n\nThe value that the historic precinct adds to the city is incalculable today.\n\nAnd you could ask similar questions about Kelly's Bush in Hunters Hill (which is facing a new fight), Woolloomooloo, Glebe, the historic buildings preserved in Martin Place, and so many other examples of successful preservation.\n\nBut there's another point worth making.\n\nSydney locals say harbour marina plans 'a disaster waiting to happen' Locals have argued if the expansion in Woolwich were to go ahead it \"would be like putting a bus station in the middle of a children's playground\".\n\nWhat Friedman criticised as the \"arbitrary private power\" of unions was not arbitrary, and it wasn't private.\n\nIt was deliberative and it was public.\n\nGovernments in the 1960s and 70s were failing to keep up with changes in community expectations about what our cities should be.\n\nThe community-led green bans helped to change official attitudes about heritage, conservation, and environmentalism.\n\nThey were part of the messy democratic reality of living in a city where developers had become too powerful and politicians had forgotten how to listen to their constituents.\n\nOf course, one could now have a debate about whether or not those green bans also left a negative legacy for our cities, given the argument YIMBYs make today that overzealous heritage protections are currently locking young people out of inner city areas.\n\nBut that's a very different argument.\n\nIf there's truth to that claim, it may just need the pendulum to swing back a bit.\n\nBut the more serious question is: would the green bans of the 1970s have been necessary in the first place if governments had been more responsive to residents' concerns?\n\nFriedman didn't consider that angle.",

        "text": "It's a fairly safe bet that you won't find too many Nottingham Forest fans mention Ange Postecoglou in the same breath as legendary coach Brian Clough.\n\nGranted, both men have managed the club in European competition \u2014 two of the only men to have done so in the club's entire history.\n\nBut where the late Clough led Forest in 994 games through the club's golden era, winning back-to-back European Cups in 1978-79 and 1979-80, as well as claiming the 1977-78 First Division title, Postecolgou's experience in the East Midlands lasted just eight winless games.\n\nThere is no doubt that Postecoglou was on a hiding to nothing.\n\nReplacing the hugely popular Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo didn't exactly put him on a comfortable footing with the home fans, who have turned on him with surprising vehemence during his unsuccessful stint.\n\nTaking charge without a pre-season and after the transfer window had already shut limited Postecoglou's options even further.\n\nAnge Postecoglou was on a hiding to nothing. (Getty Images: MI News/NurPhoto/Jon Hobley)\n\nAnd managing his first six games in the space of 23 days gave him virtually no time to work with his new players, a severe handbrake when trying to implement a radically new style onto a group of players that were simply not suited to it, the increased demands being placed on the defence further hampered by injuries to Murillo and Ola Aina.\n\nPostecolgou was bullish as recently as Friday's pre-match press conference.\n\nBut that was the last time he would talk to the press as Forest coach.\n\nThe Australian had been removed from his post before he could even hold his post-match presser, the announcement coming just 17 minutes after his side lost 3-0 to Chelsea at an increasingly venomous City Ground.\n\nThe famously hot-headed owner, Evangelos Marinakis, has to take the brunt of the criticism.\n\nEvangelos Marinakis left his seat after the hour mark in the match against Chelsea, not a good sign. (Getty Images: PA Images/Mike Egerton)\n\nIt was he who pulled the trigger to dismiss Nuno.\n\nIt was he who bought in Edu as the curiously-titled global head of sport in June, sparking the grievances that made Nuno's position untenable despite his success.\n\nIt was the appointment of the former Arsenal midfielder that so irked Nuno that, despite the S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9an guiding the club to a seventh-placed finish in the Premier League and delivering European football to the club for the first time in 30 years, he was out the door so soon into the new season.\n\nIt was Marinakis who appointed Postecoglou in the first place, a bewildering decision based on the coaches' respective playing styles, made to look all the more baffling by the fact that the favourites to replace Postecoglou are the defensively minded Sean Dyche or Roberto Mancini.\n\n\"Ultimately the results haven't been good enough and that is on Ange,\" former Newcastle and England striker Alan Shearer told the BBC.\n\n\"But the owner has to take some responsibility too. He chose Ange, it was his appointment.\n\n\"How can you go from a manager in Nuno with one style of play to someone like Ange who everyone knows wants his teams to play in a completely different way?\"\n\nEx-Spurs star Glenn Hoddle, meanwhile, said on TNT Sports that he felt for Postecoglou.\n\n\"I'm surprised he [Marinakis] has done it so quickly after the game \u2026 they've not gone well, but after eight matches as a manager, it's no time at all,\" Hoddle said.\n\n\"Surely he has got to be given more time than that?\"\n\nThe Damned Forest: Wrong club, wrong time\n\nThe simple fact is that Postecoglou was never the right fit for the Forest job.\n\nAnge Postecoglou reportedly had the backing of the players. (Getty Images: PA Images/Mike Egerton)\n\nThis is where the admittedly strained comparison with Clough does bear fruit.\n\nIn 1974, before the rambunctious and egotistical coach had ever come close to managing Forest, Clough was appointed as manager of Leeds United.\n\nHe too had replaced an iconic manager at the club in Don Revie, who had been given the England job.\n\nHe too tried to change the style of Leeds, moving them away from the sort of physicality that wouldn't now look out of place across town at Headingley when Super League's Leeds Rhinos take to the field to a more skilful passing game that had brought Clough so much success at Derby County.\n\nSure, Clough did so with all his typical bulldozer-like subtlety, instigating a furious player revolt that left the Leeds hierarchy no choice but to dismiss him.\n\nMeanwhile, Postecolgou was far more contrite when taking charge, respecting the feelings his new charges had for their old boss by giving them time and space to, essentially, grieve his loss.\n\nPostecoglou largely had the players on side too, a feature of his entire coaching career.\n\nMorgan Gibbs-White even said that when Forest finally clicked, they would be \"unstoppable\" under Postecoglou.\n\nThe click never happened though. Just as the seemingly random whims of the owner ensured he got the job, it was those same whims that cost him it.\n\nThe atmosphere at the City Ground had decidedly turned against Ange Postecoglou. (Getty Images: Shaun Botterill)\n\nRegardless of the details \u2014 which in Clough's case were muddled by the popular yet contested novelisation of his Leeds stint, the Damned United \u2014 neither of their approaches, half a century apart, worked.\n\nClough was out of Elland Road in 44 days. Postecoglou lasted 39, the shortest of any manager in Forest's history.\n\nPostecoglou cannot be blamed for jumping at the chance to return to the Premier League so soon after he was sacked by Spurs.\n\nThat's part of the deal with the top-level managerial merry-go-round \u2014 if you're off it for too long, the queue is too long and you can never quite find your way back.\n\nMore concerning for him will be the somewhat defensive, defeatist quotes coming out of Postecoglou in the lead-up to his dismissal from Forest.\n\nPostecolgou is a man who has had to fight tooth and nail for every opportunity he has been given.\n\nHis rise from struggling to get an assistant role in the nascent A-League in 2008, right the way to the Europa League title in 2025, his entire journey has been unorthodox to those in the establishment.\n\nAnge's rise from the failed dream of the NSL to European glory In 2008, Ange Postecoglou was a Fox Sports pundit who felt unemployable. Now he's the first Australian football manager to win a major European club trophy.\n\nThe mocking tone of many in Europe, particularly England, has not helped his outlook, despite his demonstrable success in an enormous variety of leagues.\n\n\"I guess from my perspective, I just don't fit \u2014 not here, just in general,\" Postecolgou said the day before his sacking.\n\nIt's a sad yet understandable comment from a man who must feel that nothing is good enough.\n\nEx-Celtic striker Chris Sutton told BBC Sport before the game that it was \"ridiculous\" the amount of grief Postecoglou was getting.\n\n\"It saddens me, actually,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't think it's fair at all.\"\n\nBut football, as he and everyone else knows, is far from fair.\n\nBrian Clough is Nottingham Forest's greatest ever manager. (Getty Images: Offside/Mark Leech)\n\nIn any football situation, and quite a few non-footballing ones to boot, there is normally a quote from Clough that fits perfectly, and this is no different.\n\n\"Sorry lads,\" Clough is supposed to have said at half-time in a match that Forest were trailing during his spectacular tenure at the City Ground.\n\n\"All my fault. I picked the wrong team.\"\n\nForest was doubtless the wrong team for Postecoglou.\n\nAnd although a desperately short stint at one top-flight club turned Clough from a brilliant manager into a legend, whether the same can happen to Postecoglou is anyone's guess.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

(ABC News: Grace Burmas)\n\nHuman Urban's appeal win means the section of the ledge that offers the best skating will now be destroyed to make room for a doorway.\n\n\"Finding out that we got to keep the skate park was totally drowned out by the loss of the Woolstore's ledge \u2026 it's a blow to the entire skate community around the world,\" WASA's Rowan White said.\n\nRowan White and Zachary Tilghman have called for more collaboration with developers. (ABC News: Grace Burmas)\n\n\"We all work full time outside of this campaign, and we've put hundreds and hundreds of hours into this, particularly around this condition with the doorways.\n\n\"If you remove these sections, it just won't work the way it did before. It would be as if you were to put a hole in the middle of a football field and say you can still play a game there.\"\n\n'Must be reopened'\n\nIn a statement, the director of Human Urban, Kyle Jeavons, said 93 per cent of the ledge would remain, which he said would allow the skate community to continue to use it.\n\n\"This has never been in question,\" the statement read.\n\nImages used in a campaign called \"Woolstores Forever\" that aimed to save the site.

This is routine when patterns in patient presentations are identified. \"\n\nBrodifacoum is commonly found in rat poison and reduces vitamin K, which is essential for blood to clot.\n\nIt can cause bleeding if ingested by humans, such as bleeding gums, easy bruising and blood in urine or stool.\n\nAuthorities are urging all hospitals, GPs and pathology laboratories to be alert to the possibility of brodifacoum poisoning following the possible poisoning cluster.\n\nHealth Minister Tim Nicholls said the detail he could provide while investigations were under way was limited, but did say the people attended Queensland Children's Hospital, Logan Hospital and Princess Alexandra Hospital this week.\n\n\u201cThe immediate warning went out on Friday night, we\u2019ve been on the alert and haven\u2019t seen any presentations since,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the source of it yet, I know there has been speculation, but we have not been able to identify the point source of the poison.\n\n\u201cThe health service is continuing to investigate to find out where it came from, but our primary concern is making sure those involved are well on their way to recovery and are in a position to be interviewed.\"\n\n'Nothing to be alarmed about'\n\nDr McDougall said there was \"nothing for the community to be alarmed about at this time\" and Queensland Health would notify the community if there was a risk to public health.\n\nCatherine McDougall says clinicians have been asked to monitor for presentations with similar symptoms.

(ABC News: Monte Bovill)\n\nACRRM and the Rural Doctors Association of Tasmania (RDAT) have told the ABC that while the hospitals will hire rural generalists, it is only as locums, and, depending on the field of their advanced skill, some of them will not be allowed to work to their full scope of practice.\n\nRural generalist obstetricians, for example, will be treated as junior doctors and are expected to work under the supervision of specialists \u2014 something that does not occur in interstate hospitals.\n\nThe state's district hospitals, like Deloraine and St Helens, have embraced rural generalists, but the opportunities are limited because those hospitals offer a reduced range of services.\n\nDr Hawkins said that when graduates could not use their advanced skills, they often left the state.\n\n\"They're all finishing their training in Tasmania and then moving over to the mainland, to Queensland, New South Wales and, to a lesser extent, Victoria and South Australia, where they've got really, really established endpoints for these positions,\" he said.\n\nThe ACRRM says rural generalist graduates are leaving for states where they can use their advanced skills. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nAnd it was not just the hospitals missing out.\n\n\"They're all GPs that would be working part time in the north-west and instead we're losing them as well,\" Dr Hawkins said.\n\n\"[That] has an incredibly direct impact on the load in the emergency departments and the flow through the hospitals.\"\n\n'It's baffling'\n\nClaire Griffiths is one of those trainees, forced to choose between \"turning away\" from the career she has worked towards or moving her family interstate.\n\n\"It's difficult to look at the options in front of me,\" she said.\n\nDr Griffiths grew up in Burnie and has been in training for four years.\n\nShe was drawn to becoming a rural generalist because of the diversity of work and the focus on delivering care to rural areas.\n\nShe has trained at both the NWRH and the Mersey, but has been told there would not be a place for her to use her advanced emergency care skills at NWRH when she finished.\n\nClaire Griffiths wants to stay in Tasmania but will not be able to use her skills in emergency medicine.

(ABC News: Mackenzie Heard)\n\n\"We know that there are dire workforce shortages of \u2026 specialists in rural and remote Tasmania,\" Dr Dodds said.\n\n\"We saw that exacerbated quite significantly during COVID where the Mersey had to reduce its hours because we couldn't fly locums in and out of the state, and certainly this comes at quite an expensive cost to the state.\"\n\nHe estimated the Mersey and NWRH spent more than $100 million on locums in the past financial year. The health department did not provide a figure when asked by the ABC.\n\nDr Dodds wants Tasmania to adopt a workforce model where hospitals hire a combination of rural generalists and sub-specialists. The rural generalists would work independently and sub sub-specialists would deal with more complex cases.\n\nThe state government is on board, with Premier Jeremy Rockliff promising more than a year ago that Tasmania would embrace the model, but Dr Dodds said the health department and hospitals had been resistant to change.\n\n\"We've really hit major barriers with that, in terms of the senior executive at the Tasmanian Health Service not understanding how this could be an ideal solution for Tasmania to increase Tasmanians' access to health care and reduced costs on the health system,\" Dr Dodds said.\n\nBen Dodds and Claire Griffiths say rural generalists would help with Tasmania's medical workforce shortage. (ABC News: Mackenzie Heard)\n\nIn a statement, a health department spokesperson said further work was underway to create new opportunities for rural generalists in the public hospital system \"once they have completed appropriate training\".\n\n\"New roles will be trialled across the North West Regional Hospital and the Mersey Community Hospital, aligned with current areas of need in the region's medical workforce,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThat trial was announced in May and is yet to be advertised.\n\nThe four roles are only 0.2 full-time equivalents and emergency department only, not the full scope of practice.\n\n\"The department is also exploring similar opportunities for rural generalists that have advanced training in other medical specialties,\" it said.\n\n\"We have also implemented a state-wide policy that considers a rural generalist for a certain role before a locum is engaged to fill that position.\"\n\nDr Dodds said feedback was that the department was \"still selecting locum specialists over permanent and locally trained rural generalists\".\n\nRural generalists are fully qualified general practitioners with training in emergency care and at least one other advanced skill. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nTasmania 'needs to move with the times'\n\nWhen he left Tasmania for work, Dr Richardson missed his island home, and he was not alone.\n\nHe knows of at least four other rural generalists who, like him, chose to live in Tasmania but work elsewhere.\n\n\"It needs to move with the times,\" he said.\n\n\" Every other state in Australia uses rural generalists in one way or another \u2026 but Tasmania is not set up for that. \"\n\nWorking in regional Tasmania, Dr Griffiths said she felt like there was a disconnect between what the community wanted and the \"barriers\" she said the THS was putting up.\n\n\"When I tell family and friends that I'm not able to work once I finish my training in Tasmania, they become really puzzled and confused because everything in my training sounds like it's exactly what the community wants,\" she said.\n\n\"We don't want doctors who are flying in and flying out.

(Supplied: Ben Parkinson)\n\nOne example spotted by Mr Parkinson was in a one in 100 chance flood, depending on if residents were in the Logan City catchment or Gold Coast City Council area of the Logan River, they may experience up to a metre of difference in flood water height.\n\n\"There's properties that are [a couple] hundred metres apart \u2026 with modelling done by the exact same company,\" he said.\n\n\"We're seeing quite a disparity based on what city you live in.\"\n\nLogan flood maps updated Logan City Council says updated flood mapping will provide better information.\n\nIt's prompted him to take his concerns to the state government, launching a petition to suspend changes to local government flood overlays, a movement that has garnered about 4,500 signatures at the time of writing.\n\nCouncils taking different approaches\n\nThe state government provides framework to individual councils who are responsible for flood mapping.\n\nIn Brisbane, mapping is based on a slew of factors, including ground level surveys and historic flood and rainfall records.\n\nThe city council said it works closely with its neighbours to develop flood studies and share data.\n\nChair for Environment, Parks and Sustainability, Councillor Tracy Davis said although flood events cannot be prevented, being prepared can make a world of difference.\n\n\"No two floods are the same, but we are committed to giving residents the most up-to-date information, so they can make confident decisions to be prepared and protect their properties,\" Ms Davis said.\n\nMore than 10,000 Brisbane properties to be added to Brisbane flood maps In its latest modelling, council finds 10,129 more properties across Brisbane are now at risk of creek and waterway flooding.\n\nIn Logan, a nine-week long community consultation is drawing to a close to inform the city's draft plan, including feedback on the way it implements the TLPI introduced in 2023.\n\nA Logan City Council spokesperson said the tool helped to \"make better decisions about where future homes and services can be safely located\".\n\n\"The proposed Flood Overlay in the draft Logan Plan guides what is permitted for future development in each flood risk area, and what mitigation measures apply to ensure the safety of people and property,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nMr Parkinson said the Logan City Council has allowed him to raise his home in 2025, an exemption to planning legislation. (Supplied: Ben Parkinson)\n\nIn the bordering City of Gold Coast council, historic flood events are utilised to inform modelling, including rainfall and gauge levels, with climate change factors also considered.\n\nThe latest flood model is also informed by a city-wide scan in 2022 which created a 3D model of the area.\n\n88,000 Gold Coast properties at flood risk The mapping shows many more properties than previously thought will be at flood risk in a \"worst-case\" weather scenario, prompting concerns over insurance premiums.\n\nA council spokesperson said it endorsed a long-term flood hazard resilience approach but was in the process of adopting the state's \"risk-based approach to planning for flood.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said there are not blanket bans on building across the city, but waterfront areas where inundation is permanent or deep in regular flooding faces restrictions.\n\n\"[Experts] can work with landowners to appropriately develop flood-affected land, where the risks to people and property can be adequately mitigated to an acceptable or tolerable level,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nImportant to maintain at local level\n\nUniversity of Queensland hydraulic engineering professor Hubert Chanson said local governments had a responsibility to residents and were best placed to offer flood resourcing.\n\n\"It has to be a joint process. You cannot expect the state government to provide guidelines that will be valid across our entire state,\" Mr Chanson said.\n\nMr Chanson's work sees him offer advice to consultants and the state government on issues relating to floods. (Supplied: Hubert Chanson)\n\n\"Queensland is the second largest state in Australia, so flooding in north west and western Queensland is totally different to flooding in Townsville or Logan.\n\n\"I think local governments know best. [They know] their catchment, their local topography.\"\n\nBut he said issues can arise where some councils are better resourced than others.\n\n\"Some could be very rich, have plenty of money to develop advanced studies and protect their communities, and some may run with very restricted financial means,\" Mr Chanson said.\n\n\"[For this reason] I think you should expect to see differences in terms of potential flood risk depending where you are along the waterway.\"\n\nMr Bleijie says he has prioritised meeting with Logan City Council to \"fix\" the council's approach to flood mapping. (ABC News)\n\nThe Queensland government is currently reviewing the State Planning Policy which guides flood risk assessments, in an effort to maintain property rights and achieve better planning outcomes.\n\nIn a statement, Deputy Premier Jarrod Bleijie said he hoped to see change in the Logan City Council's approach to flood mapping.\n\n\"I have prioritised a meeting with Mayor (Jon) Raven to fix the current flood mapping which prohibits development, and should instead deliver development certainty for Logan residents, with applications assessed on their merits,\" Mr Bleijie said.",

        "text": "The Ashes summer is well and truly under way, with barbs flying between the two Test camps as regularly as leather off the bat of Marnus Labuschagne.\n\nThat's right, because Labuschagne is very much back in form with yet another hundred \u2014 his fourth in all formats in the past month.\n\nIf the Queenslander is firming as a selection lock, here's how the rest of the wannabes and hopefuls faced up around the country in round two of the Sheffield Shield.\n\n1. Marnus is very much back\n\nMarnus Labuschagne must be licking his lips at the prospect of scoring runs every time he walks out to bat. (Getty Images: Mark Brake)\n\nIn our round one round-up, we postulated that the excitable Queensland batter may well be back.\n\nWell, since then, he's scored another two centuries and is firming as an absolute lock for a spot in the batting line-up when the Ashes get underway in Perth.\n\nHis 197-ball 159 in Adelaide once again outlined how rich a vein of form Labuschagne has found to mine at the start of this season \u2014 even if he did make just 18 in the second innings.\n\n\"Quality players get runs,\" Travis Head said on Labuschagne's recent resurgence.\n\n\"He's shown that when he's gone back to domestic level.\"\n\nNow, Labuschagne has been promoted back into the ODI squad for the confusingly timed three-match series against India.\n\nThe question many will be asking is where will he slot in to the battling line-up upon his return?\n\nInjury to Cameron Green could open his favoured number three spot, but given the paucity of options elsewhere, is opening off the cards?\n\n2. 'Elite' Boland shows Australia won't be lacking for pace options\n\nScott Boland was at his brilliant best for Victoria in their win over NSW. (Getty Images: Graham Denholm)\n\nNothing stirs the fire in the belly quite like an Ashes series, and Scott Boland seems to be getting well into the spirit with a tremendous send-off of Oliver Davies at Junction Oval.\n\n\"It's not the Scotty Boland I know,\" Blues coach Greg Shipperd said.\n\nWell, the send-off was maybe out of character \u2014 although Boland is far from a shrinking violet in the middle. However, the wicket-taking looked like prime Boland at his best.\n\nThat was Boland's first wicket as he claimed a hugely impressive 5-67 to help the Vics to a 38-run victory.\n\nWith Pat Cummins looking like he will miss at least the first Test in Perth, Australian selectors will be heartened to see this sort of bowling from Boland early in the season.\n\n\"If you'd [asked] an hour-and-a-half ago, I would have said he still has a bit of work to do,\" Victoria coach Chris Rogers said of Boland.\n\n\" It's amazing how class players step up when the moment counts. \"\n\nShipperd, meanwhile, simply described the Test bowler as \"elite\".\n\nThere were a handful of other impressive displays around the grounds from the quicks, not least recent Australia A medium pacer Fergus O'Neill, whose 5-26 in the first innings at Junction Oval showed his attributes.\n\nAt Adelaide Oval, Michael Neser's 4-30 at a miserly economy of 1.93 was eye-catching, while Wes Agar was a fair bit more expensive in his 5-88 from 18 overs.\n\nMeanwhile Western Australia's veteran paceman Matthew Kelly took 3-51 and 6-49 in Hobart, his second five-fer of the season following his 5-43 against New South Wales.\n\n3. Konstas's cute ramp nets him welcome half ton\n\nSam Konstas's timely 50 couldn't have come soon enough. (Getty Images: Graham Denholm)\n\nTravis Head leaped to Sam Konstas's defence this week, saying that a lot of the conversation around the youngster has been \"pretty brutal\".\n\nHe pointed out that he might have failed on a tasty WACA track in round one and how \"harsh\" it was to judge someone based on a couple of innings.\n\nAnd he's absolutely right.\n\nBut that's the lot of a player in the Test match spotlight with a hotly anticipated Ashes series coming up.\n\nKonstas's timely 53 \u2014 as part of a 90-run partnership with Blake Nikitaras, the second-highest opening stand of the season \u2014 couldn't have come at a better time, with his ramping of Boland a suitable headline shot for what is a first first-class 50 on home soil this season.\n\nFollowing on from his first innings duck, this flamboyant 53 may just be enough to keep his head above water in terms of selection for that second opener spot.\n\n\"He's a baby cricketer in terms of experience \u2026 there's a lot of learning to be done,\" Shipperd said of Konstas's performance in Melbourne.\n\nThe question remains, is there enough time for those lessons to take hold before the Ashes opener?\n\n4. Is Jake Weatherald in the opener conversation?\n\nJake Weatherald has performed very well so far this Sheffield Shield season. (Getty Images: Steve Bell)\n\nWith a spot, theoretically at least, available in the Australian Test team, there cannot be a worse time to have form abandon you.\n\nAnother low score for Kurtis Patterson has surely ended any chat of him getting a look in for the Test team in the foreseeable future.\n\nHis dismissals for 5 and 1 at Junction Oval means he has failed to advance into double figures this season in the Sheffield Shield, with scores of 8, 4, 5 and 1 to his name.\n\nThat is, it must be said, in stark contrast to his white ball form this year, in which he has scores of 110, 73 and 67 that may just about make selectors keep an eye hovering near the two-Test batter.\n\nBut when it comes to red-ball form from a genuine opener this year, perhaps the selectors could cast an eye at Tasmanian opener Jake Weatherald.\n\nThe 30-year-old former Redback has never been capped but averages a solid 37.83 in his first-class career.\n\nIf his scores of 67 and 57 at Allan Border Field in the opening round showed he was in good touch, his 94 out of a total of 259 in Tasmania's second innings against WA confirmed it.\n\nThat score was essentially a match-winning one \u2014 the Tigers securing a dramatic three-run victory despite half centuries from WA's middle-order batters Aaron Hardie and Richard Curtis.\n\n5. Maybe Murphy needs more love? Or perhaps it's Swepson's time to shine?\n\nMitch Swepson had a great four days out at Adelaide Oval. (Getty Images: Sarah Reed)\n\nAn interesting footnote to the Victoria-New South Wales clash was the head-to-head battle between Australia's two premier tweakers, Nathan Lyon and Todd Murphy.\n\nNow, we know that nothing that happens in the Shield short of a catastrophic injury will dislodge Lyon from the Test line-up.\n\nBut Murphy gave selectors a helpful reminder of his quality should the fast-bowling injury curse spread any further than the back-up quicks.\n\nMurphy claimed the wickets of the NSW top three in the deciding fourth innings, prevailing where the quicks could not to dismiss the well-set Konstas (53) and Blake Nikitaras (39) as well as the woefully out of form Patterson (1).\n\nHis spell of 8 overs for 3-17 broke the game open for Victoria and just gave selectors a little reminder that there is a succession plan in place for when the king of spin has had enough.\n\nWhen it comes to spin options though, Mitchel Swepson also stood up for Queensland at Adelaide Oval.\n\nTaking 4-50 in his first innings, Swepson then bowled out South Australia with a career best 6-109 in a marathon 42.2 overs in the second innings.\n\nHe dismissed the top three as well, before coming back to mop up the tail in another impressive display.\n\nSheffield Shield standings\n\nSheffield Shield player rankings\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

It's not a dog whistle any more. It's a set of bag pipes coming over the hill,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are a multicultural nation, and when people sledge multicultural Australia, there are a whole lot of Australian citizens who hear it, feel it deeply.\"\n\n\n\nAnti-immigration and counter-protesters on the march\n\nThousands of people are expected to rally across the country at counter-protests against anti-immigration demonstrations on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnite Against Racism: Migrants and Refugees Are Welcome events will be held in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganisers say the March for Australia rallies, which are also being held in most capital cities about the same time, are racist, with Nazis involved in some events .\n\n\n\n\"The far right is organised, violent and on the march,\" Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yet political leaders refuse to grapple with the reality of white supremacy and racism that is threatening and harming First Nations people and people of colour every day.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA collection of unions and community groups has organised the counter-protest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The danger posed by the far-right is imminent and rising,\" Labor for civil liberties convenor Shannen Potter said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Labor needs to wake up to the threat posed by fascism, and join with the community in showing Nazis and the far-right that they aren't welcome here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our democracy won't defend itself.\"\n\n\n\nThe counter-demonstration organisers allege the March for Australia social movement wants to introduce Trump-style deportation laws that allow the government to send non-citizens to Nauru.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey said it was shameful that politicians such as Pauline Hanson and Bob Katter spoke at March for Australia rallies in August and alleged former opposition home affairs spokesman Andrew Hastie was fuelling racism with false claims about the housing crisis being caused by migrants.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rallies come after ABC News published a video appearing to show a key March for Australia organiser co-coordinating with a Neo-Nazi at the movement's first rally in Sydney in August.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 50,000 people reportedly gathered at March for Australia events across the nation in August, gaining significant media attention.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "A potential verbal spray from Donald Trump towards Anthony Albanese during talks at the White House would not mean the alliance between the US and Australia is damaged, a federal minister says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prime minister is set to depart for Washington on Sunday for his long-awaited in-person meeting with the US president on Tuesday (AEDT).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fate of the AUKUS defence agreement and tariffs are set to dominate the bilateral talks, but the prime minister will be hoping to avoid the criticism other world leaders have experienced during their encounters in the Oval Office.\n\n\n\nEducation Minister Jason Clare dismissed suggestions a testy meeting with Trump would be a setback to the relationship with the US.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I doubt that's a problem. I think most Australians understand the importance of the relationship between America and Australia,\" he told Sky News on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've got different views on different things, Medicare, gun laws are good examples of that, but we've got more in common than we have that separates us or divides us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's these sorts of values and those sorts of interests that will drive the conversation and the relationship between President Trump and Prime Minister Albanese.\"\n\n\n\nAlbanese would face challenges in dealing with Trump on his home turf, Australian National University political academic John Hart said, alluding to other world leaders who'd faced tense exchanges with the president.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Trump's behaviour is entirely unpredictable and that is an issue as far as the prime minister is concerned,\" he told the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\nA statement from Albanese framed the trip as an opportunity for the two nations to deepen ties, including on trade on investment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prime minister will be joined by Resources Minister Madeleine King and Industry and Innovation Minister Tim Ayres for parts of the trip.\n\n\n\n\n\nA critical minerals deal with the US is likely to be used as leverage to seek lower tariffs on exports .\n\n\n\n\n\nClare said any possible critical minerals deal would not mean the relationship with other countries, such as China, would be strained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're in favour of free and fair trade. China is our biggest trading partner. The US is our greatest and most important ally,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A big part of our responsibility as a mature government is to work with both nations in Australia's interest.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO China dominates the rare earths supply chain. What role could Australia play in the sector?

It's great it's happening, albeit too late,\" he told Sky News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some strong agreements that deliver for our community and our economy and national security, I think are must-haves out of this meeting.\"\n\n\n\n",

I was born on Ngunnawal Country. Growing up, it\u2019s obviously not something that I celebrated, but it\u2019s an honour to be married to a Punjabi man and raising Sikh Punjabi children. So I think it's paying homage to that culture and making sure it continues on through our family.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nInderjit migrated from Punjab, India more than a decade ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo children later, the family is creating a new way to celebrate culture, identity, and love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not just about being guests in each other's culture, but it's participating it, learning in it so that we're demonstrating that strength to our children. Both Punjabi culture and Aboriginal culture are very inclusive and open and I'm a part of his culture and his family and he's a part of mine.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTogether for 10 years, the couple say they\u2019ve found common ground in both of their cultural backgrounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is Inderjit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The similarity is the earth, water and the sky and obviously nature. Aboriginal culture is depending on what we have and sharing with everyone else, same as our Punjabi culture, that we come from a state of agriculture where we totally depend on nature as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Punjabi culture is beautiful. South Asian culture is beautiful, and Aboriginal culture is deeply rooted in country, in connection and it's the foundation of all Australian culture. So I think coming together to celebrate Diwali together, all of us is really important.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the 2021 Census, more than a million Australians identify with South Asian heritage, and about 700,000 people in Australia celebrate Diwali each year \u2014 a number that continues to grow.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Punjabi community is Australia\u2019s fastest-growing language group.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many families, Diwali isn\u2019t just about lights and food; it\u2019s about how love, culture, and celebration can bridge differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Take the moment to spend with the family and make sure we teach the kids why we are celebrating and why it is important.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Lighting the diyas, but also going to Mela eating, sharing food either with our friends or our family. It means going to Gurdwara. It's talking about the history and what that looks like for our children and for us as a family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMelas are public Diwali celebrations which include cultural performances, traditional food and market stalls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The strength of Diwali is about inclusivity. Triumphing good over evil and the more we learn about each other's cultures and the more we come together, we can make a positive change.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Australia\u2019s Diwali, where every light tells a story of cultures coming together.\n\n\n\n",

There are very much cultural nuances that inform how people are willing to accept and access that information.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFalls are the leading cause of injury hospitalisations nationwide and costing about $5 billion last year.\n\n\n\n\n\nMost involve people aged 85 and over.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn a vibrant morning at Perth\u2019s Chung Wah Community Centre, a group of elderly Chinese residents gather.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome over taichi, some over a few games of mahjong, while others enjoy a good old karaoke.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter lunch they lean in as the two students get up the front - they are delivering the Safe Recovery Program in-language: Mandarin.\n\n\n\n\n\nPictures on-screen show the key to preventing a fall in hospital is simple: ask for help to move, wait for assistance, and never rush or go alone.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong those listening is Liu Xuxiang, an 80-year-old retired worker originally from China\u2019s Jiangsu province.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says these lessons are opening his eyes to risks he never considered and to recognise risks and take action long before a hospital admission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some people think the hospital is a safe place and assume they won\u2019t fall. In reality, falls still happen there quite often. For example, when you go to the bathroom, even a small wet patch on the floor can make you fall. One fall can lead to serious consequences. Since coming to Australia, I\u2019ve seen that people take this issue of older adults falling very seriously and I think that\u2019s great, because awareness is the first step to prevention.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Fang Linkun, who helps run programs at the community centre, the workshops are breaking down more than just barriers - they\u2019re also reshaping attitudes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They give older people a different kind of experience, not really formal teaching, more like sharing their experiences. This helps older people feel, oh, if I do this, I might lower my chances of falling. If I do that, I might avoid a fall, and I might not trouble my children so much. This is because of our Asian cultural background, once people reach a certain age, they try not to bother their children.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nResearcher Dr Loo says it\u2019s about inclusion, making sure everyone, regardless of background, has the knowledge to stay safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"One of the things they've said to us was that they felt like this information was created for them. And it was that sense of sincerity and appreciation that they were visible. It pays homage to the fact that Australia is a very diverse country. And we've got older people being admitted to hospital that may not necessarily speak English.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of its success, this initiative is now growing.\n\n\n\n\n\nResources have been translated into Vietnamese and Arabic, with Greek and Italian versions next in line.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Dogs can become so attached to particular toys they display behaviour that would be associated with addictions such as gambling and internet gaming in humans, researchers have said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a study of 105 dogs published in Scientific Reports this month, when certain dogs were deprived of their toys, they became so fixated on what they'd lost that their blood pressure increased and they ignored everything else.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Austrian veterinary researchers behind the study described this behaviour as a compulsive engagement with a specific activity regardless of any negative consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore this study, there was only anecdotal evidence to suggest that dogs had addiction-like behaviour towards toys that was similar to human addictions, the researchers said.\n\n\n\n\n\nStefanie Riemer, one of the authors of the study, said: \"It's a very commonly known phenomenon in kind of the dog world that dogs are called ball junkies.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Junkie would imply addiction, but of course, is this just a saying, or is there some truth behind it?\" said Riemer, a behavioural biologist at the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Barking bad: The ruff road to recovery SBS News 05:36 English\n\n\"So, we wanted to see if these highly motivated, highly focused, over-hyper-motivated dogs may fulfil addiction criteria that we have from the human literature, and yes, that's what we did find.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA third of the dogs reportedly displayed behaviour similar to addiction in humans, with the most obsessive breeds being traditional working dogs like German Shepherds or Collies.\n\n\n\n\n\nToy-obsessed dogs displayed high levels of frustration and \"had very little self-control\", Reimer said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even in our cool-down period, when all the toys, all the food, everything had been removed from the room ... some of these dogs stayed highly roused.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They kept focusing on the door through which the toys disappeared, or on the shelves where toys had been stored. And interestingly, when we measured heart rate, their heart rate remained very elevated the whole 15 minutes of this period after the test.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, Riemer said the study shouldn't be treated as a \"diagnostic tool\" to label certain dogs as addicts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We did discover some behaviours which would be consistent with addiction criteria from the human literature. But behavioural addictions are difficult even in humans ... so, there's always a grey area,\" she said.\n\n\n\nWhy could dogs get addicted to toys?\n\nProfessional dog trainer Una McEvoy said dog addiction had everything to do with dopamine.\n\n\n\n\n\nDopamine is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the brain's reward and motivation system. It's released during pleasurable activities and reinforces those behaviours.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's also a factor in addictive behaviour in humans, with alcohol and other addictive drugs appearing to trigger dopamine release.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut dogs don't need drugs. Instead, they get a dopamine release from actions like catching and biting down on a ball or chasing an animal, McEvoy said.\n\n\n\nDifferent breeds will obtain this dopamine release in different ways, she said. For some, it will be from a ball, for others it will be eating, following a scent or playing with a toy.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said dog owners aren't always prepared for what comes naturally to their pet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What I find quite often in my work is that we may have a human that finds a behaviour, an unwanted behaviour, and I do have to break it to them gently that this is this breed's behaviour.\"\n\n\n\nDog toys are big business\n\nIf dogs are getting addicted to their playthings, that's good news for those who produce them.\n\n\n\n\n\nPet toys and accessories have become a big business globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2022, the Australian pet industry was worth $13 billion, covering food, vet bills and, of course, toys.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat also means owning a dog \u2014 something nearly half of Australian households do \u2014 can get expensive, with a dog costing its owner approximately $25,000 over its lifetime.\n\n\n\nMcEvoy said there's no better way to keep your dog happy than to play with them yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I look at two-player toys, so I'm not a fan of a ball, but there's certain toys that have a longer handle and that you can play with your dog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes they have a ball attached to them so you can still throw them if your dog wants to have that chase, but they come back to you, you're still playing tug with them, which means that you are increasing the value of being back to you.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "In recent days, hundreds have been lining up outside retailers across Australia, but not for the latest iPhone or a flash sale.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, they're waiting hours to buy and sell gold.\n\n\n\n\n\nThose queuing up have been spurred by bullion prices hitting record highs, with an ounce of gold reaching over $6,700 on Friday, on top of a 70 per cent price surge in this year alone.\n\n\n\nQueues have started stretching out in front of gold retailers across the country. Source: Twitter / X / Destination Investing In other words, at the start of 2025, it would've been about $2,500 cheaper to buy an ounce of gold \u2014 and about half of this upswing happened in the past 30 days.\n\n\n\n\n\nA similar trend is playing out with other refined precious metals, with silver breaking a 45-year-old record on Tuesday by hitting $80.77 per ounce.\n\n\n\nWhy are gold prices increasing?\n\nVarious explanations have been put forward to explain the rise in gold prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsaac Poole, the global chief investment officer at Oriana Private Wealth, told SBS News: \"When you look at what's really been pushing demand in gold at the moment, it's been ETFs (exchange-traded funds).\"\n\n\n\n\n\nETFs are funds that own a group of assets like stocks or bonds and are bought and sold like individual shares on stock markets. According to the World Gold Council, September was the strongest month on record for gold ETF flows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You are seeing this huge financialisation of gold bullion through ETFs and retail investors racing out to buy after the market's already up 70 per cent,\" Poole said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think that's been the big story over this year and particularly the last month.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to some experts, economic uncertainties around government debt levels and the US government shutdown are part of the picture.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome also suggest that central banks are turning to gold to replace currency assets like the US dollar.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023 and 2024, central banks demonstrated an unprecedented appetite for gold, purchasing over 1,000 tonnes of gold each year, according to the World Gold Council.\n\n\n\n\n\nPoole is suspicious about this narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I would caution buying into the narrative that it's been central bank buying. I think that was a story in 2022, 2023, and 2024,\" he said.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Gold price warning as some traditional buyers tap out at record levels SBS News 07:34 English\n\n\"This is not about central banks: That buying has slowed down. What I think you're seeing now is a trickle-down effect to retail buyers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile people in China and India buying gold jewellery has been one of the main reasons behind the gold surge in the last decade, \"at these prices, at these levels, they're not buying anymore\", Poole said\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So the traditional driver of demand has dropped away, which really leads to that point that it is retail demand. It's investors racing to buy bullion from shops.\"\n\n\n\nWill gold prices fall?\n\nThere are differing predictions of where gold prices will go from here.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an analysis earlier this month, the World Gold Council said it's \"confident that gold will hold its ground\" and would \"perhaps see further uplift\" if share prices declined.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Goldman Sachs, the largest investment bank in the world by revenue, also raised its December gold price prediction to US$4,900 ($7,545) per ounce, from US$4,300 ($6,621).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an article in The Conversation, Luke Hartigan, a lecturer in economics at the University of Sydney, noted that \"ongoing demand from Russia and China\" could also lead to further increases in prices.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australian families could be sitting on a goldmine, but many are torn about selling\n\nHowever, Poole said, the public \"should really approach [the gold market] with caution\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think there's a warning here. I would put this down to momentum and sentiment.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile momentum and sentiment can drive commodity prices up, \"it's really critical to remember that gold can go down and stay down for a very long period of time,\" he cautioned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm not going to be able to pick a turning point, but it feels like a melt-up over the last month. When you see a melt-up like that, it means that prices can fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What is really critical to remember for gold is that if you go back over the last 40 years, there have been at least three periods where gold has fallen 50 per cent from its peak and then stayed at those lower prices for up to a decade.\"\n\n\n\n",

Credit: John Paul Janke He was born at the Alice Springs Telegraph Station Aboriginal Reserve in the Northern Territory in 1936.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the age of 10, he was sent to a home for boys in Adelaide, where he completed his schooling.\n\n\n\n\n\nA talented soccer player, Perkins played as a professional with English club Everton.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn his return to Australia, he played with the Croatian club, Adelaide and the Pan-Hellenic club, Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile studying at the University of Sydney, Perkins became increasingly active in Indigenous rights issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1965 he gained notoriety by leading a group of fellow students on the Freedom Ride \u2014 a tour of rural NSW centres to highlight the discrimination that existed for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in many country towns.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerkins was one of the early leaders for Aboriginal rights and will be particularly remembered for leading the freedom rides in the 1960s.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE On the 60th anniversary of the Freedom Ride, Walgett locals reflect on its enduring legacy\n\nThe Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs in Sydney, which Perkins played a significant role in establishing in the 1960s, spawned a new generation of Aboriginal activists.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerkins combined activism and public service into one.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis appointment as the first Indigenous senior executive in the Australian Public Service in the 1970s, his leadership as a departmental head and chairperson of the Aboriginal Development Commission in the 1980s, and his work as ATSIC commissioner all confirmed his place in the forefront of modern Australian history.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the age of 55, he was initiated as an Arrernte wadi, a man at the beginning of his journey.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor his children, his bureaucratic achievements spoke for themselves \u2014 they wanted their words to focus on the gift of a kidney that extended their dad's life.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time of his passing, Perkins was the longest post-transplant survivor in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement in hand, we walked out to face the large media pack that had gathered outside their house.\n\n\n\n\n\nCameras, microphones, and reporters filled the street. Aboriginal leader Christine Williams, then deputy chair of ATSIC's Sydney Regional Council, spoke first.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams reflected on knowing Perkins since she was 11 years old, saying: \"He ruffled and plucked some feathers, whatever had to be done. He was listened to because he said it with a heart and he meant what he said \u2014 and he walked alongside his people, not above them.\"\n\n\n\nFor decades, Charles Perkins combined Indigenous activism and public service into one. Source: Supplied The Perkins children huddled together, standing side by side \u2014 stoic, proud, and with a quiet strength.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen his eldest daughter Hetti spoke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Dr Charles Nelson Perkins, Arrernte and Kalkadoon man, passed away today at about 10am from complications related to renal failure,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He was surrounded by his family and friends in Sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The last 30 years of his life were made possible by a kidney donation.

And that is the most unbelievable thing of all, that it's all there waiting for us all. White people can inherit 40,000 or 60,000 years of culture, and all they have to do is reach out and ask for it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThose words continue to resonate \u2014 a reminder of the enduring impact of Charles Perkins' fight for equality and justice, and of the unfinished work that still lies ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Charles Nelson Perkins AO \u2014 the champion of champions \u2014 was aged 64.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "A disgraced doctor jailed for trafficking a \u201cbreathtaking\u201d amount of prescription drugs to a bikie gang using his Brisbane-based clinic has suffered another court blow while trying to appeal his sentence.\n\nDr Robert John Ullman is serving a 6\u00bd year jail term after pleading guilty to one count of trafficking in dangerous drugs between January 1, 2018 and September 22, 2020, and nine counts of supplying a dangerous drug.\n\nOver the two years, Ullman unlawfully trafficked schedule 2 prescription drugs \u2013 mostly benzodiazepines \u2013 through his Chermside clinic and through an unqualified gym owner who handed out drugs and received cash payments from the customers.\n\nDr John Robert Ullman trafficked dangerous drugs through his Brisbane clinic, often to members of the Comanchero bikie gang. Picture: NewsWire/ Dan Peled\n\nThey were predominantly sold to members of the Comanchero outlaw motorcycle gang, at times booked in for normal appointments.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAt his sentencing in April, Brisbane Supreme Court was told Ullman sold the drugs to 31 different people on 76 occasions.\n\nThe court was told the turnover was more than $1.5m.\n\nSix months after his sentence was imposed, Ullman launched an appeal to challenge his 2028 parole eligibility date \u2013 claiming the sentence was \u201cmanifestly excessive\u201d.\n\nHe argued the sentencing judge\u2019s reasons did not reveal how the mitigating circumstances had been taken into account in arriving at the parole eligibility date.\n\nUllman submitted there was a departure from the norm of imposing a parole eligibility date of one-third of that sentence with no explanation.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIn its published judgment, the Court of Appeal dismissed Ullman\u2019s appeal, stating his legal team had not demonstrated why the sentence was excessive.\n\nUllman argued his sentence was \u2018manifestly excessive\u2019 due to a 2028 parole eligibility date. Picture: NewsWire/ Dan Peled\n\nJustices Bradley, Doyle and Wilson said it was wrong to view the \u201cstarting point\u201d of Ullman\u2019s sentence \u2013 being the 6\u00bd year period \u2013 as the head sentence when his mitigating factors were taken into account, then to ask whether a standard non-parole period should be applied.\n\n\u201cThis requires an approach which artificially fragments the sentencing process,\u201d Justice Doyle wrote in the judgment.\n\n\u201cThe sentencing judge retains the discretion to determine the appropriate early parole date, and that discretion is not so rigidly fettered in the way that the applicant\u2019s case assumes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAt the end of the police operation targeting Ullman, his house and clinic were searched.\n\nPolice located luxury products, cash in the amount of $338,760 and a large amount of benzodiazepine and testosterone.\n\n\u201cIt was accepted that his professional earnings, apart from his trafficking and supply earnings, were significant and would have either enabled or contributed to the collection of the luxury products,\u201d the judgment states.\n\nThe Court of Appeal noted some of the circumstances of Ullman\u2019s offending and how serious they were.\n\nThey included Ullman being a medical practitioner \u201cin whom the public reposed faith and confidence, abused that to traffic drugs on a sustained scale\u201d, that he did it for commercial gain and the trafficking was \u201ccarried out in an attempted clandestine form, being paid in some instances in cash, using encrypted communication devices\u201d.\n\nUllman was caught with luxury products and more than $338,000 worth of cash when his home and clinic were searched by police. Picture: NewsWire/ Dan Peled\n\nUllman only stopped when detected by police and he encouraged customers to turn to the black market for drugs he could not supply, the judgment continues.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cEverything that could sensibly be urged in mitigation was said on the applicant\u2019s behalf and taken into account by the sentencing judge,\u201d the judgment states.\n\n\u201cThe result is not in my view manifestly excessive.\n\n\u201cThe outcome \u2026 would not be disturbed if this court was called upon to re-exercise the sentencing power.\u201d\n\nUllman\u2019s mitigating factors included the loss of his professional standing and career, the loss of his family relationship and his rehabilitation efforts in the four years since.\n\nIt was also submitted that he may have been in over his head being involved with supplying customers \u201cwho were members of an outlaw motorcycle gang\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe trafficking charge carried a maximum penalty of 25 years\u2019 jail.\n\nIn 2020, the Health Ombudsman suspended Ullman\u2019s registration as a medical practitioner when the charges were first laid.\n\nHe has no approval to practise in any employment or practice location.",

(Lukas Coch/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"I never want to have a situation where we feel committed because we announced this is where we'd be three years earlier, and we lose some of the flexibility we need to take advantage of exactly what Australia needs.\"\n\nIn September, the federal government announced 185,000 permanent visas would be made available in 2025/26, leaving the rates unchanged from the previous financial year.\n\nMr Burke said the overall migration rate would be tailored to what the country needs.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"The net overseas migration figure we're expecting will continue to soften ... and that's just getting us to appropriate levels post-pandemic,\" he said.\n\nOpposition home affairs spokesman Jonathon Duniam said the government should carry out a methodical process for determining what future migration levels looked like.\n\n\"It's time for (the government) to be transparent about how they're factoring all of these things in, like housing, health, education, public services, as to how they get the numbers,\" he told Sky News.\n\nThe minister appealed for debate around immigration levels to be done in a respectful way. (Darren England/AAP PHOTOS)\n\n\"Australians broadly agree, and indeed the minister himself has said, that (the migration level) is too high.\"\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe minister stressed the need to keep the debate surrounding migration respectful.\n\n\"People used to talk about being able to engage in dog whistle politics, and you give a message, and only certain people would really hear what you were saying. It's not a dog whistle any more. It's a set of bag pipes coming over the hill,\" he said.\n\n\"We are a multicultural nation, and when people sledge multicultural Australia, there are a whole lot of Australian citizens who hear it, feel it deeply.\"",

        "text": "Next time you visit your local beach, take a moment to look around for a small white capsule. They're usually attached to fences or trees near beach entrances, and though they may look unassuming, they could save your life.\n\nThe $120 capsules are packed with medical equipment to help in the event of a shark bite. While they were only launched a year ago, strong community support has seen the initiative expanded to more than 85 beaches around the country \u2013 with dozens more on the way.\n\nThe shark bite kits were the brainchild of Danny Schouten, who almost lost his friend Kai McKenzie to a shark attack at North Shore Beach in Port Macquarie last year. Kai lost his leg in the incident, but was there to support Danny on the day he launched the kits and has since returned to surfing.\n\nDanny (left) and Kai in October last year after installing the first shark bite kit on the same beach where Kai was attacked. Source: Instagram.com/communitysbk/\n\nParamedic raises thousands for more shark bite kits\n\nParamedic, ex-lifeguard and keen surfer Liam Brett has never met Danny in person, but felt compelled to help the cause to give beachgoers immediate access to equipment that could make the difference between life and death.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"Ever since I became a paramedic, I have kept two tourniquets in my car for myself and my friends. And just a thought crossed my mind that no one else would do that. No one else has that there,\" he told Yahoo News.\n\nLiam set out with a goal to raise about $4,000 for 35 new kits to install himself at beaches between Tweed Heads and Ballina. In just a few weeks, his goal was surpassed with an extra $2,300 raised.\n\nAll additional funds will be put towards more shark bite kits, which will be installed at even more beaches further north.\n\nThis map pinpoints the exact locations of all current shark bite kits. So far, most of them have been installed along the east coast. Source: Instagram.com/communitysbk/\n\n\"It's been unreal, it's gone even beyond what I was aiming for, which is great,\" Liam said, praising the Tweed and Byron communities for their support.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"It's now being expanded to the islands, south and north Stradbroke, hopefully K'gari and Moreton as well. Places that need it.\"\n\nThe exact locations of all the current kits can be found on this map.\n\nWhy are the kits needed?\n\nWith his medical background, Liam knows every second matters when dealing with trauma \u2013 especially if an artery has been severed.\n\nHe referenced an incident in June at Cabarita Beach when a 16-year-old boy was bitten by a shark on his right arm and right leg. There happened to be off-duty paramedics on the beach at the time, who made a makeshift tourniquet to stop the bleeding, but he feared the outcome could've been different if there were no health professionals around.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"You can bleed out in less than a minute from your femoral artery. A smaller artery, obviously the longer it takes to bleed out and it depends what pressure is applied, but it can be well under a minute if you sever a major artery,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's important that people have the right equipment because even if there's an ambulance around the corner, they're not going to be on the beach with the tourniquet with the patient in less than a minute.\"\n\nThe tourniquets inside the kit could be the difference between life and death. Source: Instagram.com/communitysbk/\n\nWhat's in the kit?\n\nLiam's raised funds get sent to Danny, who then supplies the kits completely ready for installation.\n\n\"He [Danny] is doing an amazing job. He has made it really easy for someone like me to help out and jump on board. This is absolutely Danny's thing, I'm just helping get them to this particular area, and hopefully more people will do that for their local area,\" he said.\n\nEach kit contains:\n\n\u2022 2 tourniquets\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u2022 2 large dressings\n\n\u2022 2 compression bandages\n\n\u2022 Thermal blanket\n\n\u2022 Amputated parts bags\n\n\u2022 Whistle\n\n\u2022 Gloves\n\n\u2022 Step-by-step shark bite management card\n\nTo fund a shark bite kit, visit Liam's GoFundMe page here.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
