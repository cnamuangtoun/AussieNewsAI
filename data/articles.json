        "text": "The Kennedy Centre is ending the year with a new round of artists saying they are cancelling scheduled performances after US President Donald Trump's name was added to the facility, prompting the institution's president to accuse the performers of making their decisions because of politics.\n\nThe Cookers, a jazz supergroup that has performed together for nearly two decades, announced their withdrawal from \"A Jazz New Year's Eve\" on their website, saying the \"decision has come together very quickly\" and acknowledging frustration from those who may have planned to attend.\n\nDoug Varone and Dancers, a dance group based in New York, said in an Instagram post this week they would pull out of a performance slated for April, saying they \"can no longer permit ourselves nor ask our audiences to step inside this once great institution.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Granddaughter of John F Kennedy dies weeks after terminal cancer reveal \ufeff\n\nUS President Donald Trump's name has been added to the Kennedy Centre for Performing Arts. (AP)\n\nThose moves come after musician Chuck Redd canceled a Christmas Eve performance last week. They also come amid declining sales for tickets to the venue, as well as news that viewership for the December 23 broadcast of the Kennedy Centre Honours \u2013 which Trump had predicted would soar \u2013 was down by about 35 per cent compared to the 2024 show.\n\nThe announcements amount to a volatile calendar for one of the most prominent performing arts venues in the US and cap a year of tension in which Trump ousted the Kennedy Centre board and named himself the institution's chairman.\n\nThat led to an earlier round of artist pushback, with performer Issa Rae and the producers of Hamilton cancelling scheduled engagements while musicians Ben Folds and Renee Fleming stepped down from advisory roles.\n\nIssa Rae cancelled an engagement at the venue. (Getty)\n\nThe Cookers didn't mention the building's renaming or the Trump administration but did say that, when they return to performing, they wanted to ensure that \"the room is able to celebrate the full presence of the music and everyone in it,\" reiterating a commitment \"to playing music that reaches across divisions rather than deepening them.\"\n\nThe group may not have addressed the Kennedy Centre situation directly, but one of its members has.\n\nOn Saturday, saxophone player Billy Harper said in comments posted on the Jazz Stage Facebook page that he \"would never even consider performing in a venue bearing a name (and being controlled by the kind of board) that represents overt racism and deliberate destruction of African American music and culture. The same music I devoted my life to creating and advancing.\"\n\nThe centre was originally named for President John F Kennedy after his assassination. (Wikipedia)\n\nAccording to the White House, Trump's handpicked board approved the renaming. Harper said both the board \"as well as the name displayed on the building itself represents a mentality and practices I always stood against. And still do, today more than ever.\"\n\nRichard Grenell, a Trump ally whom the president chose to head the Kennedy Centre after he forced out the previous leadership, posted Monday night on X, \"The artists who are now canceling shows were booked by the previous far left leadership,\" intimating the bookings were made under the Biden administration.\n\nIn a statement to The Associated Press, Grenell said the \"last minute cancellations prove that they were always unwilling to perform for everyone \u2013 even those they disagree with politically,\" adding that the Kennedy Centre had been \"flooded with inquiries from real artists willing to perform for everyone and who reject political statements in their artistry.\"\n\nThere was no immediate word from Kennedy Centre officials about whether the entity would pursue legal action against the latest round of artists to cancel performances. Following Redd's cancellation last week, Grenell said he would seek $US1 million ($1.49 million) in damages for what he called a \"political stunt.\"\n\nNot all artists are calling off their shows. Bluegrass banjoist Randy Barrett, scheduled to perform at the Kennedy Centre next month, told the AP he was \"deeply troubled by the politicisation\" of the venue and respected those who had canceled but feels that \"our tribalised country needs more music and art, not less. It's one of the few things that can bring us together.\"\n\nPresident John F Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law the following year naming the centre as a living memorial to him. Scholars have said any changes to the building's name would need congressional approval; the law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees from making the center into a memorial to anyone else, and from putting another person's name on the building's exterior.",

(Getty)\n\nWelfare payments rise\n\nMore than a million Australians are set to receive an increase to their payments from January 1, 2026 .\n\nThe changes will apply to those receiving \ufeffyouth allowance, Austudy, ABSTUDY, youth disability pension and carer allowance payments.\n\nThe amount will differ depending on your circumstances.\n\nA full list of the changes is available on the Department of Social Services website.\ufeff\n\nBusinesses must take cash\ufeff\n\nThis year Treasurer Jim Chalmers\ufeff announced that Australia would introduce a cash mandate for grocery and fuel retailers from January 1.\n\nUnder the new rules, \ufeffbusinesses that sell fuel and groceries must accept cash payments for these essential purchases.\n\nThe mandate will mostly apply to retailers such as supermarkets and service stations.\n\nAustralia will introduce a cash mandate for grocery and fuel retailers from January 1. (iStock)\n\nCheaper medicines through the PBS \ufeff\n\nAustralians can expect their medicine bills to be slashed in the new year.\n\nThe general patient co-payment for medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) will be capped at $25 per script from January 1 , a decrease from $31.60.\n\nThe change is a key election promise from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and is coming through with bipartisan support from the Coalition.\n\nMedicare safety net increases\n\nThe Medicare safety net will rise on January 1, pushing up the amount Australians and their families will need to pay before they are provided with increased public health subsidies.\n\nThe original safety net is increasing from $576 to $594, while the extended safety net has gone from $834 to $861 for concession card holders and from $2615 to $2699 for those without concession cards.\n\nThe Medicare safety net will rise on January 1. (Justin McManus/The Age)\n\nDental costs\n\nA trip to the dentist can be costly but there will be some additional support for some Australians. \ufeff\n\nThe child dental benefits schedule will cover $1158 every two years for eligible families from January 1, an increase of $26.\n\nThe government program was set up to cover part or all of the cost of basic dental services for eligible children aged 17 or under .\n\nChildcare subsidy change \ufeff\n\nFamilies who are eligible for the childcare subsidy will get at least 72 hours of subsidised childcare per fortnight regardless of how much they work.\n\nMeanwhile families can get 100 hours if they work more than 48 hours a week.\ufeff\n\nThe changes will come into effect on January 5, 2026.\ufeff\n\nACCC merger laws\n\nAustralia's merger laws will undergo a significant overhaul on January 1 aimed at preventing anti-competitive price rises for consumers and industry concentration.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the federal government will make it mandatory for businesses to notify the ACCC about certain acquisitions and receive subsequent approval from the regulator.\n\nA merger deal between businesses must be reported to the ACCC if it meets certain requirements, including where the companies involved have a combined Australian turnover of $200 million or more.\n\nThe previous system \ufeffwas voluntary and informal.\n\nEnergy bill discount ends\n\nTreasurer J\ufeffim Chalmers has confirmed the federal government's energy bill discount will end in the new year.\n\nThe much-needed $300 power bill relief was \ufeffoffered to households during the 2024/25 financial year, aimed at curbing cost of living pain for Australian families.\n\nAn extra $150 subsidy was then offered to Australians from July, however Chalmers revealed it would not be extended beyond December 31, 2025.\n\nTreasurer J\ufeffim Chalmers has confirmed the federal government's energy bill discount will end in the new year. (Alex Ellinghausen)\n\nCentre for Disease Control launch\n\nAustralia will establish a \ufeffpermanent Centre for Disease Control (CDC) from January 1 to help the nation prepare for and prevent public health emergencies.\n\nThe opening comes almost 40 years after the first calls for the country to establish the service .\n\nThe Public Health Association of Australia (PHAA) called it the \"most important piece of public health infrastructure in generations\", and Health Minister Mark Butler said the CDC would \"help protect Australia from diseases and public health threats\".\n\nPassport price change\ufeff\n\nIf you need to renew your passport, you will be paying more in the new year.\n\nPassport prices are set to increase increase in line with inflation.\n\nThe cost of a 10-year adult passport is currently $412, which means the price could rise to $422 in 2026.\n\nNSW toll cap to be made permanent\n\nIf you live in NSW and regularly drive on toll roads, you could save some money on your commute in the new year.\n\n\ufeffNSW Premier Chris Minns confirmed in November the state's $60-a-week toll cap would continue beyond January 1, 2026 to help motorists with the cost-of-living.\n\nThe rebate allows \ufeffmotorists to claim up to $340 back a week after spending $60 per vehicle.\n\nHowever he \ufeffwarned there could be a major change to how the Sydney Harbour Bridge is tolled to pay for the relief.\n\nMinns also announced the trial demerit point reward program would be made permanent in the new year.\n\nThis means unrestricted licence holders who incur no traffic infringements for a full calendar year will have one demerit point removed from their licence.\n\nVictorian public transport changes\n\nFrom January 1, metro public transport fares in Victoria will rise.\n\nThis includes the daily fare cap which will increase from $11 to $11.40 on weekdays and from $7.60 to $8 on weekends.\n\nPeople under 18 with a youth Myki card can travel free of charge in the new year, while concession card holders can travel for free on weekends.\ufeff",

        "text": "Cath Armstrong is not a fan of grocery shopping, so the Victorian mum uses a method that allows her to do it as little as possible.\n\nEach year between December 27 and 30, the founder of the popular Cheapskates Club dedicates a few days to a yearly shop to save her \"time, grey hairs, frustration and stress\".\n\n\"I loathe grocery shopping,\" Armstrong said.\n\nThe bulk of Cath Armstrong's grocery shopping for the entire year is done in just three days. (Polly Hanning/Nine/Cheapskates Club)\n\n\ufeff\"People wander up and down, they park their trolleys, they stop in the middle of the aisles, it nearly sends me spare.\"\n\nArmstrong switched from a weekly shop to a monthly shop years ago to avoid the chore but had to rethink her approach when life became busier with work and family.\n\n\"I stretched it out to three months, then I thought, 'Well, I can do this for six months',\" she said.\n\n\"When I hit shopping once every six months, it was just bliss.\n\n\"It took a full day but then it was just one day and for six months I didn't have to go back.\n\n\"Then I thought 'I'm going to try this for a whole year'.\"\n\nArmstrong, pictured on A Current Affair in 2015, has shared her money-saving tips with Australians for decades. (A Current Affair)\n\nArmstrong now does a yearly pantry re-stock and smaller fresh food shops every few weeks.\n\nThe annual shop costs about $1200 and consists of enough staples for her family for the year.\n\n\"All I simply did was look back over what I'd been buying and multiplied everything so it equaled a year's worth,\" she said.\n\nArmstrong finds her calculations are \"pretty accurate\", which helps her avoid food waste.\n\nDuring the yearly shop, she buys mostly generic brands from Aldi, Coles and Woolworths.\n\n\"It doesn't take up a lot of space, I've got one shelf unit in my laundry and that's about it,\" she said.\n\nREAD MORE: Cash boost for more than a million Australians\n\nArmstrong's grocery shopping method allows her to cut down on trips to the supermarket. (A Current Affair)\n\nArmstrong also comes up with an annual meal plan, which follows a similar pattern every week.\n\nDuring a typical week, the family will have a roast dinner on Sunday, meat and vegetables on Monday, pasta on Tuesday, meat and vegetables on Wednesday, homemade pizza on Thursday, fish on Friday and Mexican food on Saturday.\n\nShe then shares dinner ideas with thousands of Cheapskates Club followers to help them slash their grocery bills and navigate meal times with ease.\n\nFood is one of the biggest household expenses for Australian families but making small changes to the way you shop can have a big impact on your budget in the new year.\n\nBut Armstrong emphasises people don't necessarily need to go shopping once a year to reap the benefits.\n\n\"I try to tell people just because I do something doesn't mean it's right for you,\" she said.\n\n\"Pick the things that work for you and keep doing them.\"\n\nAustralian grocery shopping habits have changed\n\nWhen you enter a supermarket, every product is competing for your hard-earned cash.\n\n\ufeffFrom the essentials to the treats on the end-of-aisle displays, shop layouts are designed to get you to spend more, according to University of Sydney retail expert Lisa Asher.\n\n\"All of these key ingredients that we would normally buy, they're all so far apart that you have to cross the store often,\" Asher said.\n\n\"That causes you to go down the back aisle or go down the front aisle.\n\n\"You're seeing these end displays, which prompt impulse purchases.\n\n\"They're designed to make you buy and they're very effective.\ufeff\"\n\nSupermarket layouts are designed to maximise customer spend. (Getty)\n\nAnother factor that contributes to impulse spending is the current economic climate.\ufeff\n\n\"The use of promotions has become more prevalent and people, through the cost-of-living crisis, have become more deal-prone,\" Asher said.\n\n\"We've shifted from everyday low pricing, although there are everyday low products, but you've really got to look for them.\n\n\"This shift to half price, it hasn't always been like this.\"\n\nGrocery shopping habits have also changed in Australia, which has increased the likelihood of impulse buying.\n\n\"It used to be that people might do one big shop a week or once a fortnight,\" Asher said.\n\n\"The more frequently people are going now, the more there's temptation.\"\n\nSimple ways to save\n\nArmstrong has shared her money-saving tips with thousands of Australians for decades to help them live \"debt-free, cashed up and laughing\".\n\nFor Australians who want to reset their budgets in the new year, she offers a few simple suggestions to kick-start the journey.\n\nHer first tip is to take a look at your utility bills and see if there is a better deal.\n\n\"Don't be afraid to swap, it's really easy, it's painless,\" she said.\n\nHer second tip is to adjust your grocery shopping habits as necessary.\ufeff\n\n\"If you shop weekly, think about moving to fortnightly or monthly,\" Armstrong said.\n\n\"If you don't try it, you'll never know.\"\n\nHer third tip is to write a shopping list, take it to the supermarket and stick to it.\n\n\"If you've forgotten something, add it to the list for next time and make do,\" she said.\n\n\"The less money you spend in the shops, the more money you're going to keep in your purse.\"\n\nThe information provided on this website is general in nature only and does not constitute personal financial advice.

(AP Photo/Rick Rycroft)\n\n\"Outside of academic authenticity, students are opting into an 'easy way out' mentality towards their learning,\" Micallef said. \ufeff\n\n\"Also, schools are spending a considerable amount of money and funding on eSafety workshops for students that could be better spent on other endeavours.\"\ufeff\n\nThere is a growing concern that kids may begin to rely too much on artificial intelligence, particularly chatbots, following the absence of social media on their phones.\ufeff\n\n\"We know that kids are already using AI tools, whether that's talking to ChatGPT or companion apps that are actually sort of designed to make friends with people,\" director of the Centre for Human-AI Information Environments Professor Lisa Given said.\ufeff\n\n\"We know that there are people who get really taken in by the way that those systems engage with us.\n\nREAD MORE: Three words this CEO swears will help you land a better job \ufeff\n\nThe absence of social media could have teens turning towards artificial intelligence.

        "text": "Former England cricketer Alex Hartley says women \"shouldn't be scared to talk about their periods\" after she was taken aback by criticism for briefly mentioning it while commentating on the third Ashes Test for the BBC.\n\nTest Match Special (TMS) shared a 24-second clip of Hartley, who played 32 internationals for England from 2016 to 2019, talking to co-commentator Daniel Norcross on day three at the Adelaide Oval.\n\nHartley said on the live coverage that she was feeling a bit more optimistic after being \"very grumpy\" the previous day, which might have had something to do with the first day of her period.\n\n\"I think that might explain my mood yesterday,\" she said.\n\nNorcross continued his play-by-play call and added that it could not have been the reason for the \"equally grumpy\" mood of ex-England men's spinner Phil Tufnell.\n\nTo which Hartley jokingly replied: \"Well, we've all spent enough time together. Maybe we've all synced up.\"\n\n\"Could be that,\" Norcross said.\n\nThe brief interaction attracted attention from listeners and even some media outlets, which Hartley and current England bowler Kate Cross addressed on their No Balls podcast on the BBC TMS feed.\n\n\"I honestly couldn't believe it,\" Hartley said.\n\n\"I have talked about being on my period many, many, many times on TMS and the cricket must have been so boring that people decided to write about it. It's utterly nuts.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n\"I have no problems in talking about this sort of thing because I think it should be normalised. How is it not normalised?\n\n\"If a young girl is listening to the radio and hears that I'm on my period then she'll go, 'Oh, it's totally normal for people to talk about it.'\n\n\"It shouldn't be taboo.

However, she said she also received thousands of direct messages thanking her for trying to normalise the topic.\n\n\"Females shouldn't be scared to talk about their periods,\" Hartley said.\n\n\"I had, I want to say, 4,000 DMs from people being like, 'This was amazing, thanks for talking about it.'\n\n\"Even though, in my mind, I didn't talk about it, I just mentioned it.

(ABC News)\n\nThe breach by BNC occurred in the final two nautical miles of the 628-nautical-mile race.\n\nThe rule states:\n\n\"No sail sheet be sheeted over or through any device that exerts outward pressure on a sheet or clew of a sail at a point from which, with the boat upright, a vertical line would fall outside the hull or deck [except in some conditions].\"\n\nIn sailing, a sheet refers to a rope or cable used to control the movable corners, or clews, of a sail.\n\nA pole, highlighted in orange by the ABC, in use by BNC during the finish. (CYCA/ABC News)\n\nHeading into the hearing, Ms Lin said she wanted to ensure the result was \"fair\".\n\n\"A rule is a rule,\" she said.\n\n\"People started sending over a video of the finish, so we thought, 'Oh, that's interesting'.\n\n\"[We] just wanted to do, in my personal view, the right thing.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nThe Min River co-skippers lodged a protest over BNC but it is understood a competitor can only protest over a breach if they personally witnessed it during the race.\n\nIt had only seen a photograph of the issue.\n\nHowever, the race committee can lodge its own protest, which it did this morning after BNC declared to the committee that it had broken a rule.\n\nThat protest against BNC was upheld, while Min River withdrew its protest after learning of the international jury's decision.\n\nRace committee chair Lee Goddard said that once the breach by BNC was confirmed, a \"proportionate\" penalty had to be applied.\n\nHe said the rules were clear.\n\n\"Essentially, they've actually used their spinnaker in an inappropriate way which is perceived as an advantage,\" Mr Goddard said.\n\n\"They did not deliberately do it, they probably did not understand fully that they were going to break the rule, but it was photographed.\"\n\nMin River co-skippers Alexis Loison and Jiang Lin entering the protest hearing this morning.

(Supplied: Rolex/Kurt Arrigo)\n\nBNC accepts rule break but challenged penalty\n\nBNC crew Michel Quintin and Yann Rigal said they respected the decision of the international jury.\n\nThey had measured their estimated gain as between three and five minutes, but it ultimately resulted in a penalty of more than an hour.\n\nMr Rigal said they carried out the technique in order to clean the boat near the finishing line.\n\n\"Because it was just the finishing line, we wanted to prepare the boat, to clean the boat \u2026 because we knew the media was here,\" he said.\n\n\"We decided together, let's put the pole so I don't have to stand like that until the finishing line, so I can prepare the boat for the media and for everything after.\n\n\"The speed is nearly the same.\"\n\nThe double-handed crew said they were unaware at the time that they were breaking a rule.\n\n\"It's sport, it's life, we respect the decision of the international jury,\" Mr Quintin said.\n\n\"We thought we could manage to have a smaller penalty, but that's the choice.\"\n\nHandicap winner separate to line honours\n\nWhile Comanche, the first of the large 100-footer supermaxis, has been in port at Hobart since Sunday evening after taking out the line honours win, the overall winner of the Sydney to Hobart on handicap takes out the Tattersall Cup, which is seen by sailors as the \"crown jewel\" of prizes.\n\nWhat decides the overall victor is a number of factors such as boat size, sail size, mast size, the amount of water that the boat displaces when fully loaded and its expected speed.\n\nThe boat\u2019s final finish time takes on these factors as well as the time on the clock when it crossed the finish line.\n\nThe handicap system is seen as an equaliser for the fleet, meaning victory becomes much more about sailing ability than what sort of boat you are able to enter into the race.\n\nMin River completed the race in just under four days. (ABC News)\n\nRight conditions for double-handers\n\nThis year, three of the four contenders for the handicap honours were double-handers.\n\nBNC appeared to have won the overall honours when it arrived on Tuesday morning, and when fellow double-hander Crux failed to arrive by 9:45pm in the evening, after southerlies slowed its progress near Tasman Island.\n\nMichel Quentin and Yann Rigal appeared to have claimed handicap honours after they arrived in Hobart on Tuesday morning. (Supplied: CYCA/Salty Dog)\n\nAfter crossing the line, BNC crew Yann Rigal and Michel Quentin described it as \u201ca magic moment\u201d.\n\n\"Just finishing line of honour double-handed is incredible for us,\" Quintin said.\n\nDefending overall winner Celestial V70, crossed the finish line in sixth place for line honours with a time of 2 days, 16 hours, 14 minutes and 34 seconds.\n\nSailors tell of 'horrendous' ordeal in yacht race Those now safely onshore after finishing the 2025 Sydney to Hobart tell of \"horrendous\" conditions, resulting in injuries, broken boats and seasickness \u2014 even among experienced crew members.\n\nThe yacht was pipped to take out the overall victory again, but the cohort of double-handeds challenged expectations by the fourth day.\n\nThe weather conditions after the first boats finished also affected the handicap win, as good winds favoured the smaller boats.\n\nCruising Yacht Club of Australia (CYCA) commodore Sam Haynes put the result of the double-handers down to the hard southerly driven by a high-pressure system that occurred during most of the race.\n\nSam Haynes says this year's weather favoured the smaller yachts. (AAP: Ethan James)\n\n\"The smaller boats have just been in the pressure longer and been able to keep going,\" he said.\n\n\" But all the boats in this race have had periods where they've been in very light wind zones. \"\n\nThis year's race saw 17 double-hander entrants out of a fleet of 128.\n\n'Different type of sport'\n\nDouble-handed yachts were first given their own category in the race in 2021 and were eligible to win the overall prize from 2022, forming one of the race's six divisions.\n\nHaynes said the category was becoming increasingly popular.\n\n\"We tend to see about 25 per cent of the fleet as double-handed,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a great way for people to be able to access the sport with potentially less expense and so forth. It's a very particular style sailing, obviously. Big overseas, double-handed sailing, it's a different type of sailing experience.\"\n\nComanche takes out line honours in Sydney to Hobart race Master Lock Comanche claims line honours in the 80th edition of the gruelling Sydney to Hobart yacht race, with a stunning daylight hours finish.\n\nThe demands on a two-person crew are greater than on larger craft, as the round-the-clock duties of navigating, steering and sail changes, as well as sleeping, have to be shared.\n\n\"It's not the same sport,\" BNC co-skipper Quintin said.\n\n\"You are doing everything onboard, and you are a team together a lot more than with a big crew.\n\n\" Always there's something to do. Sleeping is extra. We have to sleep and to rest but that is difficult to manage but that is part of the sport. \"\n\nSailing in the 2021 race, Tasmanian GP John Saul and co-skipper Rob Gough were the inaugural two-handed line honours champion in their yacht Sidewinder.\n\nYour guide to the Sydney to Hobart yacht race Everything you need to know about the Sydney to Hobart yacht race as the 80th edition takes place.\n\nDr Saul, who is competing this year on a Huon pine yacht named Tradition, said it was exciting to see an increase in the number of smaller crews competing.\n\n\"It'd be sensational to see some variety in the winners on the winners' platform, and a double-hander would be great,\" he said.\n\n\"There's some really good quality double-hander racers in the event this year, and obviously they're really trying to ring the most that they can out of their boats.\"\n\nLine honours, the title given to the first yacht to cross the finish line, was taken out by Comanche, which soared up the River Derwent to complete the race at 6:03:36pm on Sunday.\n\nThe 100-footer led for much of the race, but had to fend off a cat-and-mouse chase with fellow competitors LawConnect and Scallywag for a thrilling finish.\n\nFollow the yachts as they sail for Hobart with the official race tracker.",

        "text": "When the clock strikes midnight tonight, fireworks will herald the start of a new year.\n\nAt the same time, a host of new laws, guidelines and price changes will quietly come into effect.\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of some of what's changing from January 1.\n\nApprenticeship payments\n\nA licensed electrician training an apprenticeship at a construction site in Sydney. ( )\n\nEmployer incentives\n\nA new payment encouraging employers to bring on apprentices in some trades will become available.\n\nIt's part of the federal government's plan to build a clean energy and housing workforce.\n\nTo be eligible, employers need to be training apprentices in a key apprenticeship priority (KAP) occupation.\n\nYou can see the list of KAP trades here.\n\nPayments of up to $5,000 will be made in two instalments during the apprentices' first year.\n\nMeanwhile, the ongoing Priority Hiring Incentive will be reduced.\n\nThis applies to employers of apprentices working towards a Certificate III or above in an occupation on the Australian Apprenticeship Priority List but not the KAP list.\n\nThe maximum payment will drop from $5,000 to $2,500.\n\nTraining support payments\n\nMany apprentices in trades listed on the Australian Apprenticeship Priority List are eligible for training support payments.\n\nBut the maximum payment will be halved to $2,500.\n\nYou can read more about the changes to apprenticeship payments here.\n\nCash payments\n\nCarolyn Hocking had to wait 15 months to receive her deceased husband's superannuation from CBUS ( )\n\nMany retailers that sell groceries and fuel will be required to accept cash payments for these essential goods.\n\nThe rule doesn't cover every store though.\n\nSmall businesses with an annual turnover of less than $10 million will be exempt, meaning they will be allowed to take payments by card only, if they choose.\n\nThe federal government announced plans to introduce the mandate in 2024.\n\nCheaper medication\n\nAustralia's medicines regulator is considering restrictions over how much paracetamol can be bought and who it can be sold to after data raised concerns about misuse and self-poisoning. ( )\n\nIf you take a prescription medication, your next visit to the chemist could be cheaper.\n\nThat's because the price of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will be capped at $25 per script, down from $31.60.\n\nPensioners will still only have to pay $7.70 per script.\n\nThe change stems from an election promise by the federal government.\n\nChildcare subsidies\n\nGeneric child toys at a childcare center in Devonport. Still taken for Young Motherhood NFT in Easy Devonport on 1 July, 2024. ( )\n\nThe federal government's Child Care Subsidy (CCS) is changing.\n\nFamilies that receive the CCS will be entitled to at least 72 hours of subsidised child care each fortnight.\n\nThis is called the 3 Day Guarantee.\n\nSome families will be entitled to 100 hours if:\n\nParents and guardians each do more than 48 hours of recognised participation every fortnight\n\nThey have a valid exemption.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children can also receive 100 hours of subsidised child care each fortnight.\n\nThis change technically starts on January 5, but with a difference of four days, we've included it here.\n\nEnergy bills\n\nSome groups, like single parent families, were less likely to have a financial buffer. ( )\n\nThe federal government's energy bill rebate scheme will expire.\n\nThe cost-of-living relief package has given a $75 rebate on household and small business bills each quarter since mid-2023.\n\nBut Treasurer Jim Chalmers announced in December it would not be extended into the new year.\n\nGas appliances\n\nChanges to the rules around gas appliances come into effect on January 1. ( )\n\nIndoor gas appliances will no longer be allowed in new residential builds in Sydney.\n\nThat includes cooktops, ovens and indoor heating and cooling systems.\n\nThe city's council plans to prohibit outdoor gas fittings down the line too.\n\nIt's all part of a measure voted on by the City of Sydney council back in 2023.\n\nLord Mayor Clover Moore said at the time the change would help \"address global boiling\".\n\nResearch has also shown gas stoves can lead to negative health effects due to the indoor air pollution they cause.\n\nPassports\n\nAn Australian passport. ( )\n\nAustralia already has the most expensive passport in the world, and the cost of one is about to rise even higher.\n\nPassport prices are adjusted annually on January 1 in line with the Consumer Price Index.\n\nThe price of a 10-year adult passport will jump by $10 to $422.\n\nFive-year passports for children and adults aged 75 will cost $213 \u2014 up $5 on last year's price.\n\nThe Australian passport remains one of the strongest in the world, though.\n\nIt allows its holders to travel to 185 destinations without a visa.\n\nThe Henley Passport Index ranked it equal seventh in October, alongside Czechia, Malta and Poland.\n\nStreaming\n\nA person holds a TV remote while sitting on a couch. ( )\n\nExpect more Australian-made film and television on streaming platforms in the future.\n\nFrom tomorrow, streaming services with more than 1 million Australian subscribers will need to invest a chunk of their revenue into making local drama, documentary, arts, educational and children's programs.\n\nThat's because of an amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act passed by federal parliament last year.\n\nIt stipulates these businesses must commit at least 10 per cent of their local expenditure, or 7.5 per cent of their revenue, to local content.\n\nYou can read more about the new rule here.\n\nWelfare payments\n\nThanks to indexation, government payments lift slightly twice a year.\n\nSome of those fortnightly pensions are getting a boost tomorrow.\n\nYou can check which allowances are increasing here.",

        "text": "When Donald Trump enforced a 10 per cent tariff on Australian beef earlier this year, there were some concerns it would impact trade.\n\nThe opposite happened.\n\nAustralia has exported a record amount of beef this year and is on track to surpass 1.5 million tonnes for the first time.\n\nThe biggest customer has been the United States, importing about 412,000 tonnes (January to November) which is up 17 per cent year-on-year.\n\nThe United States also paid record money in 2025 to import our lean beef.\n\nThe US imported beef price for lean (90CL) beef hit a record high this year. (Supplied: MLA)\n\nAccording to Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), the US paid a peak of more than $13 a kilogram for imported Aussie lean beef this year, which was up 34 per cent on the previous year, and up 64 per cent compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nThis record money flowed into the Australian cattle market, it would seem, with the national processor cow indicator reaching a record high of nearly $4 a kilogram.\n\nWhat about the tariff?\n\nDonald Trump's 10 per cent tariff on Australian beef was dumped in November.\n\nSo what did it achieve?\n\nAccording to meat analyst Simon Quilty, not much.\n\n\"If tariffs were meant to persuade people from shipping [beef to the US], it did quite the opposite, for Australia at least,\" he told the Country Hour.\n\n\"Australian lean beef is a necessity [for the United States] because they simply don't produce enough of their own.\n\n\"Because of drought they've been liquidating their herd to a 70-year low, and with fewer cows comes less lean beef.\"\n\nMr Quilty said US consumers bore the cost of the tariffs this year.\n\n\"To me it was all passed through to the US consumer at the other end,\" he said.\n\n\"The humble hamburger is in huge demand and ground beef continues to be the number one item sold throughout America's retail sector.\n\n\"The tariffs have now been removed, but I think the demand will continue, just perhaps not at the same pace in 2026.\"\n\nWhat about imports?\n\nEarlier this year, Donald Trump incorrectly stated that \"Australia bans American beef\".\n\nAs explained by ABC Landline, Australia did not have a ban.\n\nAustralia allowed imports of US beef as long as it was from cattle born, raised and slaughtered in the US.\n\nThe sticking point was the US's demand for expanded access, which would allow it to export beef from cattle sourced out of Canada and Mexico and processed in the US.\n\nLoading...\n\nWhen Australia agreed to this request in July, there were some concerns it would open the gate to large consignments of imported American beef.\n\nThe opposite has happened.\n\nAccording to trade data up to the end of October, Australia has imported just 150 kilograms of US beef and 18 tonnes of Canadian beef.\n\nABC Landline has sought more details from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, but is yet to receive a response.\n\nAustralian beef took centre stage at the SIAL food trade show in Shanghai this year. (Supplied: MLA/ABC Landline)\n\nThen there's China\n\nTrump's tariff war with China created ripple effects across the global beef trade \u2014 which benefited Australia.\n\nSince March, about 300 abattoirs in the United States have been unable to export beef to China, which opened the door to Australian grain-fed beef exports.\n\n\"Australia's largest beef market has been the United States, but 2025 has not been a one-market story,\" MLA's Andrew Cox said.\n\n\"China beef imports have increased 44 per cent [year-on-year] and has been Australia's second largest beef market.\"\n\nAt a major trade show in Shanghai this year, MLA's Murray Davis said it was obvious Australian beef was having its moment.\n\n\"Australia is absolutely centre stage [here in China] and we are dominating the premium end of the beef market,\" he said.\n\n\" Our major competitor over the last few years has been the United States, but with the trade disputes between China and the US, the US is effectively out of the market. \"\n\nBeef in 2026\n\nOverall, it has been a good year for Australian cattle producers.\n\nThere has been drought in parts of Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales, which meant some producers were forced to sell stock.\n\nBut they received strong money thanks to good overseas demand and producers further north having a great season.\n\nIn fact, there was record money for processor cows, thanks mostly to the huge demand for lean beef in the United States.\n\nAustralia produced a record amount of beef, exported a record amount of beef and 2026 is shaping up well for those with green grass and stock to sell.\n\nBut markets can do funny things, so fingers crossed.\n\n\n\nABC TV's Landline will return in 2026.

        "text": "Ashton Turner joined one of the Big Bash's unluckiest clubs as he helped revive Perth's season, his unbeaten 99 leading the Scorchers to a 71-run win over the Sydney Thunder.\n\nAfter coming to the wicket with the visitors 3-34 in the sixth over, Turner became just the fourth player in BBL history to be stranded on 99 not out as he took his side to 8-202 at Sydney Showground.\n\nThe Thunder was then bowled out for 131 in reply in the 18th over, with the hosts unable to capitalise on a hot start from David Warner (25) and Matthew Gilkes (33).\n\nAfter one win from its opening three games, Perth was staring down the barrel of its worst start to a season in five years with defeat on Tuesday night.\n\nBut the BBL powerhouse is now back in the top four, with the Thunder 1-4 and its season all but over.\n\nThat was largely thanks to Turner, who blasted eight sixes from his 41 balls and narrowly missed out on the fifth-fastest century in BBL history.\n\nWith Perth in early trouble, Turner changed the game when he smashed three off the ninth over from Chris Green.\n\nHe then hit Tanveer Sangha for another six down the ground, before taking down Daniel Sams late in the innings.\n\nBig Bash League Stranded on 99 not out Shaun Marsh, Perth vs Melbourne Renegades, 2011-12\n\nJosh Philippe, Sydney Sixers vs Melbourne Stars, 2021-22\n\nColin Munro, Brisbane Heat vs Melbourne Stars 2023-24\n\nAshton Turner, Perth vs Sydney Thunder, 2025-26\n\nAfter starting the final over on 86, Turner smashed Sams for two big sixes over long on to move within touching distance of his maiden BBL ton.\n\nBut after driving the left-armer for a single, Ashton Agar hit a boundary of his own and was then caught in the deep on the penultimate ball to deny Turner the strike.\n\n\"I've been getting single-figure scores the last couple of games, so it's better than that,\" Turner quipped.\n\n\"Once I got to 20, I was like, 'At least I've done something tonight'.\n\n\"I knew what I was on, but I also had 200 in my mind as a really good team score and we were approaching that.\n\n\"We had 260 chased down a week ago, so you're never thinking you have enough runs. We wanted to scrap together every run we could.\"\n\nIn the end, the Scorchers' total was plenty enough.\n\nWarner and Gilkes shot out of the blocks to be 0-60 after 6.3 overs, before the former was well caught in the deep by Finn Allen.\n\nGilkes was then run out in a mix-up with Sam Konstas (21), with the Thunder's chase never really looking likely beyond that.\n\nInstead, Aaron Hardie, Cooper Connolly, Joel Paris and Brody Couch all took over with the ball, taking two wickets each to completely derail the hosts' innings.\n\nThe Scorchers also caught supremely well, in a return to their best after an off few nights in the field.\n\nAAP",

        "text": "With 2025 almost over, now is perhaps as good a time as any to look back at where we could have invested our hard-earned money \u2014 but probably did not.\n\nThose who had the foresight (or luck) to buy mining stocks at the start of the year would have seen the value of those investments double, or even triple.\n\nTake, for example, Liontown Resources \u2014 a battery minerals company that reported a $193 million loss in the previous financial year.\n\nDespite its lacklustre financial performance, Liontown counts mining billionaire Gina Rinehart as its largest shareholder (with an almost 20 per cent stake through her company Hancock Prospecting).\n\nGold miners dominate the list of best performing stocks in 2025. (Bloomberg, ABC News)\n\nThe company has also inked lithium supply deals with Tesla, Ford and LG. And it received a $50 million investment from the federal government in August as part of its Future Made in Australia strategy to prop up certain industries in the national interest.\n\nIt is no wonder the share price of this unprofitable, partly taxpayer-funded lithium miner has surged 180 per cent since January, making it one of the best performers on the Australian share market.\n\nShares of its rivals Core Lithium (up 220 per cent), PLS (up 89 per cent) and IGO (up 65 per cent) have also enjoyed strong gains.\n\nThe rally was also driven by a rebound in lithium prices (since crashing in 2023 on concerns about an oversupply of the battery mineral) and expectations of strong demand for electric vehicles in the years ahead, particularly in China.\n\nSkyrocketing gold miners\n\nAnother surprise was the sheer number of gold miners in the list of this year's best-performing stocks. They included Regis Resources, Genesis Minerals, Evolution Mining and Newmont Corporation.\n\nShares of mining companies surged in 2025. (Bloomberg, ABC News)\n\nThe value of their shares has roughly tripled in the past year as the price of physical gold has hit new record highs throughout the year, even climbing as high as $US4,532 an ounce last week.\n\n\"What's driving the price higher in the last two years is mainly central banks buying gold as they move away from the US dollar and US dollar assets like Treasury bonds,\" said Gemma Dale, nabTrade's head of investor behaviour.\n\nGold is seen as a safe-haven asset that tends to do well in times of global uncertainty.\n\nFinancial commentators often cite US President Donald Trump's erratic policymaking and ever-changing tariff policies as reasons for gold's relatively recent popularity.\n\nAnother concern is whether the Federal Reserve will continue to make interest rate decisions independently, free from the White House's interference, particularly given the US president's recent efforts to appoint rate-cutting loyalists.\n\nGemma Dale expects President Trump to have less influence on the markets in 2026. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\nOn top of that, the Fed has already slashed America's interest rates three times in 2025 and is likely to keep cutting them next year, which has contributed to the US dollar losing 10 per cent of its value this year.\n\nSo all this, along with concerns about US economic exceptionalism and geopolitical conflict, has led to huge demand for bullion, which in turn has led to the share prices of many Australian gold mining companies rising to their most expensive levels ever.\n\nTrump, TACO and the ASX\n\nOverall, the local share market has done reasonably well, with the ASX 200 up 10 per cent (when dividends are included), and the broader All Ordinaries index gaining 7 per cent.\n\nBut for those who bought into the Australian market in early April, after Mr Trump caused a global crash with his so-called liberation day tariff, and sold at a record high in late October, their gains would be much higher at about 24 per cent.\n\nWhen asked to describe 2025, the words \"volatility\" and \"stress\" were what came to mind for Ten Cap's lead portfolio manager and stock picker, Jun Bei Liu.\n\nJun Bei Liu expects 2026 to be a volatile year for markets. (ABC News: John Gunn)\n\n\"It's been very stressful because of the unexpected nature of the tariff negotiations,\" she said.\n\nShe said: \"No-one expected Trump to be negotiating tariffs so openly, which has been the cause of all this volatility on the markets\" \u2014 as evidenced by the extreme swings in share prices (up and down) that have regularly occurred throughout the year.\n\nMs Dale also found 2025 to be quite a stressful year for share investing.\n\n\"We had so much concern about what the implications of those particular tariff announcements were going to be, and whether there'd potentially be a catastrophic collapse in global trade, something like we saw during COVID,\" Ms Dale said.\n\nDonald Trump with his 'reciprocal tariffs' chart on April 3, 2025. (Reuters: Carlos Barria)\n\n\"As those fears failed to materialise \u2026 everyone jumped on the TACO trade.\"\n\nTACO is an acronym that stands for \"Trump always chickens out\", and is used by traders to describe the US president's tendency to make grand tariff threats that cause investor panic \u2014 only for him to then backflip to some degree, giving time for markets to rebound.\n\nThe TACO trade \u2014 which is essentially the belief that markets will recover after Mr Trump's initial shocking announcements \u2014 has helped push many countries' share markets to their highest levels ever.\n\nUnderperforming compared to foreign markets\n\nHowever, the ASX appears to have underperformed against its overseas peers, particularly Wall Street's S&P 500 (up 18 per cent), Japan's Nikkei (up 28 per cent) and South Korea's KOSPI (up by a whopping 76 per cent).\n\nGold up again in 'extraordinary global scenario' The price of gold has hit another record and is set to become Australia's second most valuable resource export after iron ore.\n\nUnlike those nations, Australia's technology sector is much smaller, making up only 3 per cent of the local share market's value.\n\nSo the ASX has not benefited as much from the artificial intelligence (AI) investment boom, which has led to the share price of Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet and Tesla (\"the Magnificent Seven\"), as well as the broader US stock market, soaring to new heights.\n\nAnother difference is that those foreign stock markets belong to countries that have seen significant falls in their exchange rates because they are likely to be recipients of further stimulus in 2026 (whether it is interest rate cuts or massive government spending).\n\nIn contrast, Australia is more likely to see interest rates rise next year due to the return of higher inflation, which is expected to stick around for longer than what the RBA is comfortable with.\n\nThe Australian market had much smaller gains than its overseas peers. (Refinitiv, ABC News)\n\nAs a general rule, lower interest rates (and cheaper borrowing costs) usually lead to stock markets rising as investors pile into riskier, speculative investments \u2014 and feel more comfortable overpaying for stocks. Rate hikes, on the other hand, tend to have the opposite effect (that is, investors \"selling down\" and taking profits as the cost of money becomes more expensive).\n\nOvervaluation worries\n\nConcerns about the share market (or certain companies and sectors) being overvalued have grown louder over the past year.\n\nCommonwealth Bank, for instance, has developed a reputation for being the most expensive bank in the world, especially when judged by its price-to-earnings ratio (basically, the amount of money people are willing to pay for each dollar of profit it earns).\n\nAfter hitting a record high of $191.40 in June, CBA's share price has undergone a major correction, having dropped 16 per cent in six months.\n\nThe ASX 200 crashed in April, then scaled a new record high within months. (Refinitiv)\n\nWorries about the market being too expensive have also led to the collective value of the ASX's technology and healthcare stocks falling by more than 20 per cent this year.\n\nIndeed, tech and health care are the worst-performing sectors on the local share market \u2014 largely due to steep falls in the share price of biotech giant CSL (-39 per cent), bookkeeping software firm Xero (-33 per cent) and logistics software company WiseTech Global (-45 per cent).\n\nWiseTech, meanwhile, has also taken a hit from personal scandals involving its founder Richard White, which led to him being forced to step down as CEO \u2014 though he has since taken up the executive chairman role.\n\n\"Valuations are too high for some of the tech and AI-related stocks, and we're seeing a little bit of a reality check for those sectors,\" Ms Liu said.\n\nThe tech and healthcare sectors had the steepest falls in 2025. (Refinitiv, ABC News)\n\nShe does, however, expect companies like NextDC and Goodman Group, both AI data centre owners, to earn strong profits next year, which will support their share price.\n\nWhat to expect next year\n\nMs Liu expects \"resources [stocks] should continue to do well, led by copper and gold prices\".\n\n\"Airlines should do better because oil prices are reasonably low and some of the 'oversold' tech companies could make a comeback,\" Ms Liu said.\n\nPenguin permacrisis as economic norms go in Trump\u2019s shredder This year saw economies survive tariff shocks and markets burst through record highs, but it doesn't feel like a party because so many people aren't invited.\n\n\"I think the share market will do OK next year and should deliver a return between 8 and 10 per cent. That's pretty much an average year.\"\n\n\"We expect there'll still be volatility because we still haven't got the final outcome for the China and US tariffs. All we've got from both sides is just a framework.\"\n\nAlthough Mr Trump's unpredictability had a significant impact on markets this year, Ms Dale believes he will have far less influence in 2026.\n\n\"The markets don't believe him anymore,\" she said.\n\n\"They believe that everything he does is a negotiating tactic, so it's no longer credible. So he can make these big dramatic announcements and they won't be market-moving anymore.\"\n\n\"And I think that's a really interesting outcome because people trust that he will back down. Trump has flooded the airwaves to the point where the market is just a little bit more relaxed.\n\n\"At this point, 2026 looks like it could be a solid, boring kind of year with the major sectors holding up OK, but not sensational levels of growth.\"",

        "text": "More than half of Queensland's automotive repair businesses say they are struggling to find skilled staff, with some advertising for more than six months without success.\n\nA new report on the state of the industry has found attracting and keeping skilled workers is its biggest challenge, despite consistent growth in demand.\n\nThe industry-commissioned Capricorn report surveyed 989 business owners around the country as part of its annual state of the nation release.\n\nScott Wilmington and his brother have operated their own garage in Morayfield, north of Brisbane, for more than 20 years.\n\nHe said he was not surprised by the statistics.\n\n\"We're constantly looking,\" he said.\n\nMechanic Scott Wilmington says it is difficult to find qualified workers. (ABC News: Stephen Clarke)\n\n\"We had an ad for a couple of years and would have had 200 applications.\n\n\"Out of them, there were probably only a handful that we would possibly interview.\"\n\nMr Wilmington said the vast majority of applicants did not have the skills needed to suit a busy workshop.\n\n\"They say, 'look, I've worked on my car at home a little bit and I know my way around a car,' or some of them are plumbers wanting to change [fields],\" he said.\n\n\" We're too busy to have someone that's not qualified. \"\n\nChief executive of the Motor Trades Association of Queensland, Rod Camm said labour and skill shortages were the \"number one issue\" for the industry.\n\nThat is despite a post-pandemic boost in demand for mechanic services, with a 13 per cent increase in the number of registered motor vehicles on Queensland roads between 2020 and 2024, according to the Queensland government's latest State of the Environment report.\n\nSome mechanics say they have been advertising for more than six months without finding a skilled worker. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\n\"During COVID when no one could travel, everyone pivoted and started investing in their vehicles, making sure they were maintained, so our industry's still really, really busy,\" Mr Camm said.\n\nThe latest data from the state Department of Trade, Employment and Training showed 1,825 people completed their automotive apprenticeships in 2023-24.\n\nMr Camm said the challenge of attracting young people to take up a career in the automotive industry was \"multi-layered\".\n\n\"Schoolkids often nowadays don't have parents working on cars in the backyard, so they don't have a modern perspective of what an automotive career would look like,\" he explained.\n\nAutomotive industry warn of skills crisis Lack of workers and apprentices, long waits for parts and an increasingly complex market are driving waiting times for car repairs through the roof.\n\nHe said the base rate of pay in the industry could also turn young people away.\n\n\"My message to them ... is that is not what you will earn in the industry,\" he said.\n\n\"As you become productive and develop your skill set, you can earn really, really good money.\"\n\nSome businesses turning overseas\n\nSome business owners have been willing to pay more than $20,000 to bring in skilled mechanics from overseas.\n\nThe Philippines has proven particularly popular, due to widespread English-speaking skills.\n\nMr Wilmington said he turned to recruiting overseas workers \"out of desperation\".\n\n\" I think we had no choice. We really were running out of options and we needed a mechanic. \"\n\nBonie Fernandez spent almost 20 years working as a mechanic in Saudi Arabia, sending money back to his family in the Philippines.\n\nBonie Fernandez works as a mechanic in Brisbane while his family live in the Philippines. (ABC News: Stephen Clarke)\n\nMr Wilmington hired him last year through an online agency based in Western Australia.\n\nMr Fernandez said the work was \"much more enjoyable\" than some of his previous jobs, including working in Saudi Arabia where he said there was a lot of \"pressure\".\n\nHe now hopes to become a permanent resident and bring his family to Australia to live with him.\n\n'Hard to keep up'\n\nThe lack of workers was affecting both customers and business owners, according to Mr Camm.\n\n\"Customers can expect to have some delays to get their vehicles repaired,\" he said.\n\n\"And for businesses, they struggle with workloads.\"\n\nThe report showed 33 per cent of Queensland automotive businesses are turning away work due to being understaffed \u2014 compared to 27 per cent nationwide.\n\nAbout one third of automotive repair stores say they've had to turn away work due to not having enough staff. (ABC News: Luke Bowden)\n\nMr Wilmington agreed it could be \"really hard\" to keep up with demand, particularly because his business had a large customer base.\n\n\"You've got to do the job so you get busier ... you've [got to do that balancing act] where you don't get yourself too snowed under but you meet everyone's needs,\" he explained.\n\nMr Camm said a recent federal government decision to slash incentives to take on apprentices from $5,000 to $2,500 from January 1 next year was putting the industry's future at risk.\n\n\"I just can't believe the government would walk away from an industry,\" he said.\n\n\" It's been a very disappointing decision. \"\n\nIn a statement, the federal Minister for Skills and Training Andrew Giles said the government was \"backing Australians to get the skills they want for the jobs we need\".\n\n\"We're ensuring incentives are geared towards the skills we most need, and complemented by measures to ensure apprentices have access to additional supports like study loans and living away from home allowance.\"",

Amaroo Bangalow Cabins are designed by architecture firm Shaun Lockyer in Brisbane. Timothy Birch Perfect for: Couples or large groups who want to feel secluded without straying too far\n\nBefore Amaroo Bangalow landed on luxury-seekers\u2019 radars it was built as a family retreat, a fact that\u2019s charmingly evident in the details. Down a gated driveway, cresting the ridgeline of a 240-acre black Angus cattle and macadamia farm, all four lodges back onto a patch of sloping rainforest. Supremely modern and cosy, each boasts a distinct style, studded with beautiful personal touches that aren\u2019t always a given in holiday rental territory, and perks like heated towels racks, Mukti amenities and in-room fireplaces. You can book a single cabin for two, or the entire property \u2013 remarkably, either way, you still enjoy exclusive use of the central communal pavilion, with its expansive kitchen and facilities \u2013 our favourites being the heated pool and wood-fire oven. It feels gloriously secluded, despite being mere minutes\u2019 drive from the terrific restaurants of Bangalow village and The Hut at Possum Creek.\n\nFrom $850 a night per cabin, which includes exclusive use of the property. 47A Cedarvale Rd, Bangalow NSW.

        "text": "Australian singer Danielle Marsh, a member of the Korean pop (K-pop) group NewJeans, is facing a lawsuit exceeding $44 million from a South Korean record company owned by the K-pop giant that produces BTS.\n\n\n\n\n\nMarsh, 20, was born in NSW to an Australian father and a South Korean mother. She rose to global prominence in 2022 following the debut of NewJeans, a five-member group whose members were aged between 14 and 18 at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nNewJeans was created and produced by ADOR, a subsidiary of HYBE Entertainment. HYBE, one of the world's largest K-pop companies, is estimated to have recorded cumulative revenue of approximately $2.075 billion up to the third quarter of 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, five NewJeans songs topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart, cementing the group's rapid rise globally.\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, ADOR filed a lawsuit against NewJeans after the group accused the label of \"mistreatment\" and announced plans to leave the agency.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn October, a South Korean court found no grounds for termination and ruled the group must continue under their contract with ADOR until 2029.\n\n\n\nFollowing the ruling, South Korean media reported all five members were expected to return to the agency. However, an announcement from ADOR on Monday has shocked K-pop fans worldwide.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, ADOR said that while it had been engaging with the remaining four members \u2014 including another Australian member, Hanni Pham \u2014 the agency had decided to terminate its contracts with Marsh.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe company said it also intended to \"pursue legal accountability against one member of Danielle's family\" as well as ADOR's former CEO, Min Hee-Jin, who the BBC described as the \"mentor\" of the group.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agency said Marsh's family member and Min \"bear significant responsibility for causing this dispute and for the delays in NewJeans' departure and return\".\n\n\n\nSouth Korean news outlet The Chosun Daily reported on Monday that ADOR had filed a claim with the Seoul District Court for more than $44 million in damages against Marsh, Marsh's family member, and Min.\n\n\n\nAustralian singer gave testimony over alleged workplace bullying\n\nBeyond its multi-billion-dollar revenues and global soft-power reach, the K-pop industry is widely known for exerting strict control over artists through long-term contracts with detailed and often rigid conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legal dispute between NewJeans and ADOR has sent shockwaves through South Korea's music industry, drawing widespread attention from international fans.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome have expressed sympathy for NewJeans over allegations of bullying and harassment allegedly directed or condoned by the company.\n\n\n\n\n\nFans of Pham \u2014 the Vietnamese-Australian member of the group \u2014 submitted a petition to the South Korean government calling for an investigation into the alleged workplace bullying she and the group faced.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn October 2024, Pham delivered a tearful testimony before South Korea's parliament over the allegations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I know it's not going to solve all the problems in the world, but if we just respect each other, at least there will be no problems with bullying and harassment in the workplace,\" Reuters quoted Pham telling South Korean leaders.\n\n\n\nOne month later, South Korea's employment ministry dismissed NewJeans' workplace bullying complaint, stating that under the country's Labour Standards Act, Pham was not legally classified as an \"employee\" of ADOR.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decision prompted several leaders to propose new legislation \u2014 now dubbed \"Hanni's Act\" \u2014 aimed at extending protections against workplace bullying and harassment to artists.\n\n\n\n\n\nPham also faced the possibility of deportation after her long-term employer-sponsored work visa was set to expire in early 2025 amid the ongoing legal dispute. Her parents confirmed in February that she had secured a new visa.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat same month, The Chosun Daily reported that five of South Korea's major industrial bodies issued a joint statement criticising NewJeans for \"resolving private disputes through media campaigns and unilateral public statements rather than proper negotiations or legal procedures\".\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the organisations said they did not oppose government regulation, they argued that contract disputes between agencies and artists should be addressed through industry self-regulation.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "As the calendar turns to 2026, Australia is gearing up for a year of significant change \u2014 and not just the usual flurry of resolutions, gym sign-ups, or attempts to learn a new language.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time, the shifts will reach far beyond personal goals, shaping household budgets, workplaces and even the country's infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom tax relief and payday super to the launch of a national Centre for Disease Control, a suite of reforms is set to roll out \u2014 some of which may have slipped under the radar.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's a look at what Australia 2026 has in store.\n\n\n\nTax relief in 2026\n\nIf you're earning more than $18,200 a year, expect a small but welcome boost to your pay packet in 2026. From 1 July, the lowest 16 per cent personal income tax rate will drop to 15 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government says the change will give Australians up to $268 extra each year, increasing to as much as $536 from 2027.\n\n\n\n\"[That will be] how many coffees a year?\" Jenny Wong, the tax lead of Certified Practising Accountant Australia, an accounting body, told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not a lot, but I guess it's better than nothing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said personal tax cuts are always of interest to people, \"even though it's only 1 per cent\".\n\n\n\nSmall business support\n\nIn April, the government announced it would extend the $20,000 instant asset write-off by a further 12 months, until 30 June 2026, to support small businesses. The law was passed in the Senate in November.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder this plan, eligible businesses can claim an immediate deduction for the business-related part of an asset's cost in the year it is initially used or installed.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to 4.1 million small businesses with an annual turnover of less than $10 million will benefit from this support, according to the government.\n\n\n\n\n\nWong believes this is the \"biggest\" tax change for Australians in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These measures are essentially designed to help small businesses invest in new assets,\" she said.\n\n\n\nIn other changes, specific holiday homes may be considered 'leisure facilities' by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) from July 2026, meaning owners may not be able to claim deductions for maintenance unless the place is mainly rented out to generate income.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, from next year, the ATO general interest charge (GIC), a fee added to overdue tax debts each day, will no longer be deductible.\n\n\n\n\n\nATO assistant commissioner Anita Challen said the change will mean it will cost more to carry a tax debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"While taxpayers won't feel this change until next tax time, ATO general interest charge is currently charged at 11.17 per cent and compounds daily, making it so important to get on top of your tax obligations,\" she said in a statement.\n\n\n\nMillions to 'benefit' from superannuation changes\n\n2026 will be the year \"millions of Australians will benefit strongly from some key changes\" in superannuation laws, according to the Super Members Council CEO, Misha Schubert.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, from July, the payday super laws will come into effect, meaning workers will receive their superannuation on payday.\n\n\n\nBased on current legislation, superannuation payments must be made at least four times a year, on or before the quarterly superannuation due dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The payday super will be the biggest single change across the super landscape in 2026. It will be a really momentous day, from 1 July when those laws come into effect,\" Schubert told SBS News.\n\n\n\nSuper for those on parental leave\n\nFrom July, those on paid parental leave will also receive superannuation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ATO will automatically pay this contribution directly to the employee's super fund after the end of the relevant financial year, starting from July 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has also announced a 30 per cent tax rate on earnings from super balances between $3 million and $10 million. And a 40 per cent tax for balances over $40 million.\n\n\n\nCheaper medicines\n\nFrom the moment the clock passes midnight, and we enter 2026, the most a patient needs to pay for the medicine listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) will drop from $31.60 to $25.\n\n\n\n\n\nPensioners and concession cardholders will continue to pay only $7.70 for their prescriptions until at least 2030.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move was announced by Labor during the May election campaign and will save Australians $200 million per year through the new cap on the scheme.\n\n\n\nThree days of subsidised child care a week\n\nIf your family is eligible for Child Care Subsidy (CCS), from 5 January, you will have access to three days of guaranteed subsidised childcare per week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe changes will remove the current activity test to guarantee subsidies for families earning up to $530,000.\n\n\n\nThe test requires parents to be employed or engaged in approved activities to qualify for CCS, with government support levels determined by the number of hours spent in these activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nFamilies that earn more than $533,280 will remain ineligible for subsidised childcare.\n\n\n\nChanges to social security payments\n\nAustralians receiving Youth Allowance, Austudy, ABSTUDY, Youth Disability Support Pension, and Carer Allowance will receive more money under the new changes to social security payments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum Youth Allowance for a single Australian with no dependents will rise to $684.20 from $663.30 in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome thresholds for student payments will also rise, as will the parental income test threshold for the Youth Allowance and ABSTUDY.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Carer Allowance for about 680,000 people will also rise by $2.9 per fortnight to $162.20.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Social Services Minister Tanya Plibersek, these changes mean \"more than one million Aussies balancing study or caring responsibilities will receive a boost to their payments\".\n\n\n\nEnergy rebates to 'dry up'\n\nNot all the changes in 2026 will save Australians more money.\n\n\n\n\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers has ruled out another round of Energy rebates for 2026, which saved households $300 in the 2024 budget and $150 in the second half of 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nSally Tindall, data insights director at financial comparison site Canstar, warns Australians might experience a \"bill shock\" in their energy bills next year, as the federal government rebates will \"dry up\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The last instalment from the federal government for the majority of houses landed in their accounts in October. Now the majority of people are on a quarterly billing cycle, and so they will most likely use up that $75 credit in this quarter,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO As power prices surge, David has found ways to cut running costs by thousands SBS News 05:34 English\n\n\"When their next quarterly bill lands anywhere between January and, in some cases, maybe even as late as early April next year, that is likely to be their first rebate-free bill, and they could be in for quite the shock,\" Tindall said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For the last 18 months, those $75 instalments from the federal government have been keeping electricity bills artificially lower.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fate of electricity prices will also be known after negotiations between providers and the government next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nTinall said she expects households to pay more for electricity with the start of the new financial year from July 2026.\n\n\n\nThree hours of free power\n\nIn 2026, you might have access to free power.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom July, households in NSW, south-east Queensland and South Australia will have access to the Solar Sharer scheme, which will give consumers free access to electricity for three hours each day.\n\n\n\n\"That will be an interesting one to watch and see how the market reacts to this solar share offer,\" Tindall said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnouncing the scheme in November, Energy Minister Chris Bowen said: \"People who are able to move electricity use into the zero-cost power period will benefit directly, whether they have solar panels or not and whether they own or rent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The more people take up the offer and move their use, the greater the system benefits that lower costs for all electricity users will be,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAustralian Centre for Disease Control\n\nFrom January 2026, Australia will have a Centre for Disease Control (CDC), aiming to respond to and prevent public health emergencies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CDC will be responsible for wastewater surveillance to monitor disease and for communication with regional and local partners.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Australia to open permanent centre for disease control, health minister says\n\nThe centre will be led by a director-general appointed by the health minister and start operations on 1 January 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate professor Paul Griffin, from the University of Queensland Medical School, earlier told SBS News the establishment of a CDC will help Australia's response to infectious diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are in a very precarious situation right now, both in how we're currently responding to existing threats and vaccine rates is a huge issue,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So, we need to do more for what we're already dealing with, but we also need to be really well-prepared to be on the front foot for new and emerging threats as well.\"\n\n\n\nA new question in the Census\n\nIn August 2026, the Census will also take place after five years, but this time, there will be some changes to the questions you will be asked.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February, the Australian Bureau of Statistics announced the 2026 Census will feature updated questions related to sex, household, and family relationships, with revised wording to specify \"sex recorded at birth\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt will include the revised work to differentiate it from a separate question on gender.\n\n\n\n",
