(Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\"The decision not to report wasn't just about external risks like losing a job, it was also deeply tied to internal struggles,\" Neall said.\n\n\"People weigh up whether reporting will make things better or worse and they often concluded it wasn't worth the emotional toll, the risk to their reputation, or the likelihood that nothing would change.\"\n\nThe research identified three key psychological needs that influence reporting: autonomy (feeling in control), competence (feeling capable), and relatedness (feeling respected and supported).\n\nREAD MORE: Almost 5 million Aussie social media accounts wiped in a single week \ufeff\n\nPeople say they do not feel supported in reporting harassment. (Getty)\n\nWhen these needs are undermined - by unclear processes, fear of backlash, or a lack of trust in the system - people are far less likely to speak up.\n\n\"Victims and witnesses feel that they're having to choose between protecting themselves and speaking up, and that pressure makes the decision emotionally charged and very difficult,\" co-author Professor Lydia Woodyatt said.\n\n\"If people believe the system won't provide them justice or protect them, they stay silent. That silence isn't about indifference, it's about survival.\"\n\nResearchers called for more positive and empathetic workplace cultures. (Getty)\n\nParticipants described feeling unsure whether their experience \"counted\" as harassment, fearing career damage, and doubting that reporting would lead to meaningful action.\n\nMany worried about being labelled as troublemakers or weak. Others said the process itself felt punishing, with burdensome steps and little reassurance.\n\nOne of the studies, a historical review of workplace sexual harassment reporting and investigation, found these challenges were not new.\n\nWhile laws and policies have evolved since the 1980s, the research revealed that reporting systems remained largely ineffective.\n\n\"For decades, organisations have focused on legal compliance and punitive measures, but these approaches often fail to address the cultural and psychological barriers that keep people silent,\" Neall said.\n\nBoth studies call for a shift towards trauma-informed and transformative justice approaches, which move beyond punishment to address the root causes of harassment and create cultures of respect.\n\n\"People told us they didn't want revenge, but rather that they wanted assurance that it wouldn't happen again,\" Neall said.\n\n\"Reporting should feel like a step towards positive change, not a risk to your wellbeing.\"",

        "text": "There is no evidence using paracetamol during pregnancy increases the risk of autism in children and discouraging its use could cause more harm than the drug itself, according to new analysis by one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world.\n\nA comprehensive review of evidence, published in The Lancet, has reinforced advice from peak medical bodies across the world that paracetamol is safe to take during pregnancy.\n\nThe paper comes just months after the Trump administration advised pregnant women to limit the use of acetaminophen \u2014 also known as paracetamol \u2014 arguing it was linked to autism in children.\n\n\"Don't take Tylenol \u2026 Tylenol is not good,\" US President Donald Trump said at the time, using the drug's American brand name.\n\nFive experts on Trump's paracetamol and autism claims Leading Australian experts in medicine, autism research and obstetrics say the US president's claims are \"a misreading of science,\" or at worst, \"a misuse\". Here's why.\n\nThe advice was quickly condemned by medical experts as baseless and causing unnecessary fear, while Australians with autism said they felt they were being \"scapegoated\".\n\nNow, an analysis of 43 existing studies, published in The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology, & Women's Health journal, has found the strongest available evidence does not support a link between paracetamol use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental harm.\n\n\"This [review] found no evidence that maternal paracetamol use during pregnancy increases the risk of autism spectrum disorder, ADHD or intellectual disability among children,\" the paper stated.\n\nThe researchers, from a range of European countries, said the \"politicisation of scientific uncertainty\" had created confusion among pregnant people, which could put them in danger.\n\n\"Avoidance of paracetamol based on inconclusive evidence could expose pregnant women and their babies to known risks associated with untreated fever or severe pain,\" the paper stated.\n\n\"Untreated maternal fever, in particular, has been linked to miscarriage, congenital anomalies, preterm birth, and differences in neurodevelopment.\n\nDonald Trump and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr have previously raised concerns about the use of paracetamol during pregnancy. (Reuters: Kevin Lamarque)\n\n\"For this reason, discouraging the appropriate use of paracetamol has the potential to cause greater harm than the drug itself.\"\n\nIn Australia, paracetamol is considered a category A medication during pregnancy, which means it has been taken by a large number of pregnant women without any proven increase in any direct or indirect harmful effects on their babies.\n\n\"The message is clear: paracetamol remains a safe option during pregnancy when taken as guided,\" said the study's lead author, Asma Khalil, Professor of Obstetrics and Maternal Fetal Medicine at City St George's, University of London.\n\n\"This is important as paracetamol is the first-line medication we recommend for pregnant women in pain or with a fever, and so they should feel reassured that they still have a safe option to relieve them of their symptoms.\"\n\nPrevious research likely distorted by genetics and other facts\n\nThe review prioritised sibling-comparison research, with commentary published alongside the paper saying it offered \"strong evidence\" because they controlled for shared genetics and environmental factors.\n\nOne of the largest studies it relied on was a 2024 study on more than two million births in Sweden which compared siblings.\n\nThe study concluded that previous research, which had reported a link between paracetamol and autism, had likely been distorted by genetics, environmental factors or health conditions affecting the mother.\n\n\" The well-established tendency for autistic traits to run in families are more plausible explanations for previously observed associations than any direct effect of paracetamol. \"\n\nDavid Trembath is head of autism research at CliniKids, The Kids Research Institute Australia. (Supplied)\n\nThey noted pregnant women tended to overestimate the risk of medication-related harms, and could be overly susceptible to misinformation and shame.\n\n\"Limited understanding of the underlying causes of ADHD and autism spectrum disorder could leave affected mothers particularly susceptible to self-blame.\"\n\nThe authors said while there were limitations around their research, such as being unable to control for factors like when and how much paracetamol pregnant women were taking, they hoped their findings would put an end to \"any scepticism on using paracetamol\".\n\nDavid Trembath, head of autism research at CliniKids, The Kids Research Institute Australia, said while Mr Trump had a \"very loud microphone\" the results of the study should put concerns about paracetamol use in pregnancy \"to bed\".\n\nExperts say women must not avoid taking paracetamol because of the US president's comments. (Adobe Stock: fizkes)\n\n\"Unfortunately, we do live in a world where sometimes messages catch hold and it's hard to, even with the most comprehensive evidence, such as from a review like this, it's kind of hard to take them out of people's minds,\" Professor Trembath said.\n\n\"But I'm really confident that if people talk to their GPs, their doctors, et cetera, that they'll be able to provide a really clear picture of the evidence \u2026 which is clear and consistent that there is no association between paracetamol and autism, ADHD and intellectual disability in kids.\"\n\nHe also noted discussions around paracetamol use in pregnancy causing autism, and the portrayal of the condition as something inherently negative could be upsetting to people with autism.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"I'm really sad that people have had to go through this whole series of events, but I'm hoping that this will put an end to it, that we can get back to focusing on what really matters.\n\n\"And that is giving people with disability all of the same opportunities that are readily available to their peers, and focusing on how to support people to live the best life possible.\"",

(Supplied)\n\nOne post from October 2024 states, \"the further you birth away from the delivery suite the better the outcomes\" \u2014 a statement Dr Zorbas said was \"simply false\".\n\n\"Statements like this perpetuate myths about healthcare that can harm mothers and babies,\" he said.\n\n\"What we say as healthcare providers on social media matters.\n\n\"It's important that those working in healthcare are able to raise concerns and contribute to quality improvement, but they also can't inappropriately erode public trust in the health system.\"\n\nOther posts on the Midwives in Darwin social media page state \"there's a difference between hospital policy and evidence-based practice\" and \"between what your midwife has to say and what she wants to say\".\n\nMs Marks is the director of Midwives in Darwin, but it is unclear who the administrator of the Facebook page is.\n\nMs Marks declined to comment on the social media content.\n\nMs Marks, who has worked as a midwife for 13 years, was born in Darwin and returned to the city during the COVID-19 pandemic after studying and working in Adelaide.\n\nShe said, after working at Royal Darwin Hospital (RDH) for a time, she began her own private midwifery practice in Darwin with a focus on homebirths.\n\nShe said Midwives in Darwin would at first offer midwife-supported births at RDH for privately insured women and, while homebirths were not yet included in the contract, she hoped to expand to provide them.",

        "text": "When the world's largest battery-powered vessel is moved from the Tasmanian shipyard where it was built to its new home in South America, it will need the help of a \"gargantuan\" heavy-lift ship.\n\nHull 096, built by Hobart's Incat, started sea trials on the River Derwent in Hobart on Friday, making history as the first electric ship of its size and capacity to move on its own.\n\nThe 130-metre ferry, with a capacity for 2,100 passengers and 225 vehicles, is powered by more than 5,000 batteries, weighing in about 260 tonnes.\n\nA single charge carries only enough energy for the ferry to run for 90 minutes.\n\nThe harbour trials form part of a testing and commissioning program that will continue in the lead-up to the vessel's delivery to South America. (ABC News: Mitchell Woolnough)\n\nHull 096 will be named China Zorrilla, after a Uruguayan film and theatre star who died in 2014.\n\nIt will be used by Buquebus, a South American ferry operator that connects the Uruguayan capital Montevideo and the Argentinian capital Buenos Aires, which are on opposite sides of the Rio de la Plata (River Plate).\n\nThe view from inside the China Zorrilla wheelhouse.

(Supplied: Incat)\n\nSo how will it get there?\n\nA heavy-lift ship, which Incat's public relations and corporate affairs manager, Tom Cooper, described as \"gargantuan in size\", will be brought in to move Hull 096.\n\nThere are only a few of these vessels operating in the world. One is expected to arrive in Hobart in either February or March, depending on when Hull 096's sea trials are finished.\n\nThe trials involve testing propulsion, manoeuvrability, control systems, and onboard operational performance in \"real-world conditions\", Incat says. (ABC News: Mitchell Woolnough)\n\nMr Cooper said the use of the heavy-lift ship on the River Derwent would be a \"carefully managed process\" with exclusion zones set up.\n\n\"It'll all be done through the maritime authorities, MAST [Marine and Safety Tasmania], AMSA [Australian Maritime Safety Authority], all the port authorities will be actively involved as well,\" he said.\n\n\"Incat will work with them so there won't be any disruption to any users of the River Derwent.\n\n\" But there will be exclusion zones for the couple of days that the heavy-lift ship is here, being that it's such a large ship and we don't want to jeopardise any other marine users' safety while that process is taking place. \"\n\nHull 096's journey to South America will take about 28 days.\n\nFerry performance being tested\n\nBefore it starts plying the waters of the Rio de la Plata, the ferry is being put to the test on the River Derwent.\n\nOn Friday, it performed a series of manoeuvres to test how it responded on the water.\n\nIncat says the ship will be capable of carrying 2,100 passengers and more than 220 vehicles. (ABC News: Mitchell Woolnough)\n\nMore sea trials are planned over the coming weeks to test the ferry's onboard operational performance, control systems, propulsion, and manoeuvrability.\n\nIt is estimated the ferry will reach upwards of 25 knots during speed trials.\n\nThe ferry has been more than two years in the making, and Mr Cooper said Incat workers stepped out of their sheds on Friday morning to watch it move.\n\n\"There was a big sigh of relief when the ship started moving away from the wharf, but also a massive sense of pride here,\" Mr Cooper said.\n\n\"This is what the world \u2014 and the maritime industry globally \u2014 has been waiting for: to see this ship finally moving after more than two years of construction.",

(ABC News: Baz Ruddick )\n\n\"I'm nearly 80. You've got to keep your mind active and keep it going,\" Mr Downing said.\n\n\"Some people have said, 'Oh, why would you sit on that seat with all those old blokes?', and I say, 'Well, when you get up in the morning feeling a bit down, you come down here and within 10 minutes you're laughing,\" he said.\n\nEvery morning Raymond Downing walks his dog down to Tully's Seat of Knowledge to have a chat with friends.

I'd rather do this than watch breakfast TV in the morning. \"\n\nHe said much of the chat at the table centred on the past.\n\n\"Mostly we were farmers, so we talk about different styles of farming and how it used to be done and how it's done today,\" Mr Parisi said.\n\nKurrimine Beach is a popular spot for fishing and for those seeking a quieter lifestyle. (ABC News: Baz Ruddick)\n\nRoots in the old country\n\nDr Bianka Vidonja Balanzategui, a historian with an interest in 20th-century migration, said the 'seat of knowledge' tradition had roots in the Italian communities that were established through migration to the region.\n\n\"Trees, tables, chairs of knowledge in the Italian community are gathering places for elderly gentlemen to meet,\" Dr Vidonja Balanzategui said.\n\n\"They would talk about their ailments, the world, argue about the state of the world, and [talk about] their families.\n\n\"Many of these gentlemen were farmers, so they had retired and may have moved into the township.\"\n\nBianka Vidonja Balanzategui says gathering places in North Queensland are likely a tradition that came from Italian migrants in the region. (Supplied)\n\nShe said the tradition could be traced back to the Roman forum.\n\n\"Around the forum were our main civic buildings \u2014 your important buildings,\" she said.\n\n\"All the Italian piazzas reflect that forum construction landscape. So that is the main focal point of the village for women and men and young people to gather.\"\n\nDr Vidonja Balanzategui said that although many of those who originally gathered at certain 'places of knowledge' had passed, and the tradition had declined in some areas, there was a resurgence in other areas.\n\nItalian cane cutters in the early 1920s take a break from work in the Innisfail region. (Supplied: State Library of Queensland)\n\n\"You will notice that a new generation of people getting into that retirement stage are probably picking up versions of that tradition and perhaps gathering outside a cafe and sitting there for a couple of hours of a morning,\" she said.\n\nSense of humour a must\n\nAt the end of Tully's Seat of Knowledge sits a placard reading the 'departure lounge'.\n\n\"That's where the older ones go to die,\" Mr Steele joked.\n\nA sense of humour is a must when it comes to taking up a perch at Tully's Seat of Knowledge.

(ABC News: Patrick Thomas)\n\nClosing the gap\n\nMr Raymond said Indigenous inmates creating artwork \"plays a part in the closing the gap initiatives\".\n\n\"If justice and the community are really serious about closing the gap, then culture, as in artwork, must sit basically at the centre of that rehabilitation,\" he said.\n\n\"Seeing artwork created in custody that's been purchased with proceeds going to the artist, and then more importantly displayed in institutions such as the Downing Centre, Court and Admiralty House, it sends a really powerful message to mob.\n\n\" Basically what it tells them is all those historical factors of being excluded, and racism and discrimination, and all the negative effects of colonisation, they are changing in 2026. \"\n\nMultiple artworks feature animals. (ABC News: Patrick Thomas)\n\nHe said it reflects an \"emerging commitment to recognition and respect\" that can can hopefully \"lead to change\".\n\n\"When we're only 3.8 per cent of the population, there's obviously something wrong when we're 30 to 40 per cent of the prison population,\" Mr Raymond said.\n\nUltimately for John, it makes him feel \"really proud to know that people do appreciate my work\".",

(ABC News: Crystalyn Brown)\n\nHe then moved alone onto a 1966 boat he bought for $18,500 called Mary Rose.\n\nMary Rose is moored at one of the 76 berths at Kangaroo Point's Dockside Marina, which Mr Koursaris said costs him $1,455 per month, including power and water.\n\nMary Rose was built in 1966 and has competed in five regatta races. (ABC News: Crystalyn Brown)\n\n\"I do have a storage shed, that's $150 a month, and I have a car space that's $275 a month,\" he said.\n\n\"So it's less than two grand a month; less than $500 a week, and that includes all my expenses.\"\n\nRenting a unit in Kangaroo Point costs an average of $720, according to Domain's December quarter data, with most renters also paying utility bills on top of that.\n\nJordan Koursaris moved onto his boat six months ago, following a recent divorce. (ABC News: Crystalyn Brown)\n\nThe realities of living on a boat\n\nFor Mr Koursaris, living on a boat is not just about saving money \u2014 it is a lifestyle he had dreamed about for years.\n\n\"I've always wanted to live on a boat. I went through a divorce and \u2026 lived in an apartment for a year and thought, now's the time to do it,\" he said.\n\n\" I just wanted to test it out and see if I liked the lifestyle. \"\n\nBut life on the marina is not without its complications.\n\nMary Rose is about 8 metres long and 2.5 metres wide. It's compact, and Mr Koursaris has to duck his head while moving around the boat.\n\n\"I don't stand much \u2026 or at all,\" he said.\n\nA bed is built into the bow, with an emergency escape hatch over the mattress.\n\nThe bed has an escape hatch overhead, in case of an emergency. (ABC News: Crystalyn Brown)\n\nMr Koursaris said while the bed was \"comfy\", he had recently struggled with a wood fungus growing under the bed.\n\nHe had to treat it with a toxic epoxy, which meant he had to sleep on a bean bag in his office building for a night.\n\nThe living area is compact, with two small benches serving as a bathroom and cooking space. A hollow, padded bench \u2014 the cabin's only available seat \u2014 is also used as a storage space.\n\nOne of the benchtops hosts a miniature rice cooker and hot plate set.\n\nMr Koursaris says the miniature appliances he bought to furnish his compact kitchen make him feel like he's \"living in a doll-house\". (ABC News: Crystalyn Brown)\n\n\"This makes me [feel] like I'm living in a doll house,\" Mr Koursaris said.\n\n\"It wasn't until after I got them that a friend said, 'You know they're for kids to learn how to cook?'\u2026 [but] they work.\"\n\nBooks and toiletries are crammed into nooks and crannies. A varnished wood chest holds his summer clothes, while his winter attire is kept in a storage space offsite, and the wardrobe is rotated according to the seasons.\n\nMr Koursaris has been inventive while trying to fit life necessities onboard. (ABC News: Crystalyn Brown)\n\nThe wood fungus on the bed is not the only challenge Mr Koursaris has faced since moving onto the boat.\n\nThe business development manager has also struggled with regular power outages and hail-damaged solar panels in the six months he has lived onboard.\n\nBut living on a boat was always a dream, and now he is living it and planning to upgrade to a larger vessel by the end of the year.\n\nThe living area on Mary Rose is compact. (ABC News: Crystalyn Brown)\n\nA 'fun new experience'\n\nHis neighbour, Josh Goodswen, is also a recent divorcee and has been living on a boat for a month.\n\nMr Goodswen said he and his ex-wife had previously lived in Noosaville and Sydney, and estimated he is now spending \"a third\" of his previous living expenses.\n\n\"I just thought I'd be in for a bit of an adventure \u2026 I thought, 'hey, time to branch off,'\" he said.\n\n\"The berthing rent is really economical. If you look at some of the apartments around, they're paying quite substantial rents.\"\n\nMr Koursaris continued to downsize, moving from a house, into a unit, then onto Mary Rose. (ABC News: Crystalyn Brown)\n\nSam Dunmore lives on the next finger over. The 22-year-old is among the younger residents at the marina.\n\n\"It's my parents' boat \u2026 we used to have it moored on the Gold Coast, just sitting there, not doing anything,\" he said.\n\n\" I wanted to live in the city \u2026 and I chose to live on the boat because it would be a fun new experience. \"\n\nIf the retail worker rented an apartment like his friends, he said he would be spending much more.\n\nCotality data shows weekly rent in Brisbane averages $708, while Domain's latest quarterly rent report found prices rose 3.1 per cent in the December quarter.\n\n\"Compared to owning or renting \u2014 with all the extras on top of that \u2014 it's a lot cheaper,\" Mr Dunmore said.\n\nRent rises by almost 50pc in five years\n\nCotality's executive research director for the Asia Pacific, Tim Lawless, said he estimates renters in Brisbane would be spending more than a third of their gross income on rent.\n\nBrisbane rents growing faster than other major cities The median asking price for a rental house in Brisbane rose by more than 3 per cent last quarter.\n\n\"The cost of renting has increased by around 49 per cent over the past five years. In dollar terms, that means renters in Brisbane are paying about $225 more a week than they were back in December 2020,\" he said.\n\n\"They're up 50 per cent across regional Queensland.\"\n\nBuying property is also out of reach for many Australians, with an average house in Queensland's capital now setting buyers back $1.13 million. An average unit costs $807,161, according to Cotality.\n\n\"While it's a little out of the box, a houseboat might be a practical and affordable option, even though it does come with its own challenges,\" Mr Lawless said.\n\nMr Koursaris uses disposable utensils, to reduce washing up in the boat\u2019s small sink. (ABC News: Crystalyn Brown)\n\nIncrease in permanent boat residents\n\nDockside Marina manager Ken Allsop said he had seen more people residing at the marina in recent years, with boats spanning from 10 metres up to 25 metres.\n\nHe estimated a third of the boats docked are permanently lived in by the owners, many of whom utilise the bathrooms, showers and laundry in amenities blocks.\n\nKen Allsop estimates a third of the boats docked at Kangroo Point's Dockside Marina are permanently lived in. (ABC News: Crystalyn Brown)\n\n\"When I got involved with the marina \u2026 it was 75 per cent vacant,\" Mr Allsop said.\n\n\"It's a nice lifestyle, it's a waterfront apartment for nowhere near the millions that some people spend.\"\n\nMr Koursaris is planning to upgrade to a larger vessel by the end of the year. (ABC News: Crystalyn Brown)\n\nFor Mr Koursaris, his six-month trial of living on the water has been largely positive, and he is now planning to upgrade to a larger boat.\n\nBut he admitted he could eventually move back into a house or unit \"at some point\".\n\n\"Living on a boat is very fun \u2026 sometimes it's not too practical, but I'm enjoying it at the moment.\"",

(Supplied: Graeme Stegmeyer)\n\n\"We've had no contact with the organisers at any stage during their planning process, and we made a request that they remove any reference to Ski Racing SA,\" Mr Stegmeyer said.\n\n\"The last thing we need is for an unsanctioned event to happen, and something serious goes wrong.\n\nSki Racing Australia's SA branch has contacted the group asking to remove any reference to Ski Racing SA in its name.

        "text": "As the countdown to next month's 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Milano-Cortina continues, it is sometimes worth taking a step back and thinking about what the Olympics really means.\n\n\"The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle. The essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well,\" said Baron Pierre de Coubertin, founder of the modern Olympics.\n\nSportsmanship and the principles of fair play were at the heart of his Olympic vision.\n\nNobody has exemplified that more than Australian Sarah Blizzard this week.\n\nAt last weekend's World Cup meet in St Mortiz, Switzerland, the Dutch two-man team of Dave Wesselink and Jelen Franjic realised they had a problem.\n\nTheir Olympic dream was on the rocks.\n\nThe week before, in Winterburg, the Dutch pair finished in 21st place.\n\nTo meet the Netherlands' strict qualification criteria, they had to finish in the top eight in Switzerland or face a month off while their rivals were shooting down the Pista Olimpica Eugenio Monti in Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nDave Wesselink (right) and Jelen Franjic were facing Olympic heartbreak. (Supplied: IBSFsliding)\n\n\"We saw we had potential in the two-man bobsled but the equipment wasn't good enough,\" Wesselink told NU.nl.\n\n\"A 21st-place finish wasn't where we belonged. That result convinced us we had to do things differently if we still wanted to make it to the Games.\"\n\nBut what to do?\n\nCustom-built sleds can cost anything up to $150,000 and getting a replacement on such short notice would have been impossible.\n\nBut what about loaning one for their race?\n\nThat's when Blizzard stepped in.\n\nSarah Blizzard (right) and Desi Johnson compete together in the two-woman bobsleigh. (Supplied: IBSFsliding)\n\n\"We kind of work together already,\" Blizzard tells ABC Sport from Altenburg, where the final World Cup event on the season is set to take place this weekend.\n\n\"We have a bit of a cooperation with our team, with the Belgians and the Dutch at the track anyway.\n\n\"We have worked together, and the Dutch coaches and mechanics have helped us quite a lot in the past.\n\n\"They [the Dutch] had a race in Winterberg in Germany and it wasn't the result that they needed.\n\n\"I was actually watching the race in my hotel room and I saw it looked like a nice run. Just there wasn't a lot of speed in the sled and about five minutes later the coach calls me and goes, 'Hey, Blizzard, would you consider lending us your sled in St Moritz?'\n\n\"They said there's no speed, they needed a better sled, so I'm like, alright, let's talk about it and it kind of went from there.\"\n\nIt was still a big call to make.\n\nBlizzard's sled is her own, paid for through sponsors and family loans for about \u20ac35,000 ($60,700).\n\nThe Dutch were thrilled after realising they had achieved their goal. (Supplied: IBSFsliding)\n\nBobsled is not a cheap pursuit.\n\nBut Blizzard was happy to loan them the sled and it paid off in a big way.\n\n\"They got the result that they needed and it was very heartwarming,\" Blizzard said.\n\n\"We absolutely loved watching it. We were so excited for them, they're great guys. They've been helping us so much and I'm very, very happy for them.\n\n\"But then going forward to the Olympics as well, it's another opportunity for them to hopefully perform in a better spot too, because they're obviously capable of it.\"\n\nThe men's two-man bobsleigh race takes place the day before the women's event, so Blizzard and her brake woman, Desi Johnson, would not be using theirs on that day.\n\n\"The bobsled world is one big family and we've always had a good relationship with the Australian women,\" Wesselink said.\n\n\"We politely asked if we could borrow their two-man bobsleigh. They said yes, and we didn't even have to pay for it.\"\n\nSpot the difference. The Dutch team (top) were very happy to use the Australian team's (bottom) sled. (Supplied: IBSFsliding)\n\nThe story cuts to the heart of what the Olympic experience is supposed to represent and has incredible parallels with the Italian sliding legend whose name adorns the track where the gold medals will be decided next month.\n\nEugenio Monti was the first ever recipient of the Pierre de Coubertin Fair Play Trophy for two acts of sporting selflessness at the 1964 Games in Innsbruck.\n\nIn the four-man competition Monti helped the Canadian team fix their sled after they broke an axle during their first run and then, in the two-man competition, Great Britain's sled was damaged due to a bolt having sheared off, with Monti offering the Brits one from his sled to enable them to continue to compete.\n\nBoth teams that Monti helped went on to win gold in their events, beating Monti and his Italian teammates into the minor medals.\n\nEugenio Monti (right) was awarded the first ever Pierre de Coubertin Fair Play Trophy. (Getty Images: Keystone/Hulton Archive)\n\n\"[British driver Tony] Nash didn't win because I gave him the bolt. He won because he had the fastest run,\" Monti said amid criticism from the Italian press.\n\nMonti, at that stage in his career, had not won an Olympic gold medal, adding another level to his stellar display of sportsmanship.\n\nIt is clearly an ethos that has continued to the present day.\n\n\"Bobsleigh is a very friendly sport,\" Blizzard said.\n\n\"If you need help, you can generally find that with the team somewhere. Honestly, it's a very, very friendly sport.\"\n\nAustralia's quartet of female bobsleigh sliders (from left) Desi Johnson, Bree Walker, Sarah Blizzard and Kiara Reddingius. (Supplied: IBSFsliding)\n\nBlizzard, a former track athlete who notably competed in four-straight Stawell Gift finals before switching to the ice to partner Bree Walker in the two-woman bobsled before the last Olympics, is still in the hunt for a spot in Milano-Cortina.\n\nThe 29-year-old Victorian slider was a reserve in Beijing and is desperate to compete in Cortina.\n\nShe is currently ranked 23rd in the 2025/26 Two-Woman Bobsleigh World Cup standings, with a best performance of 17th in Winterberg at the start of January, although that only takes into account World Cup events, with Blizzard also picking up qualification points on the Europe Cup circuit where she is ranked fifth.\n\nBree Walker, who is second in the monobob World Cup standings with three wins this season, is ranked 17th in the two-woman standings.\n\nThe Aussies will find out if they make it to the Games on Friday, when the team is announced in Melbourne.\n\nThe Dutch though are already there.\n\n\"My phone is blowing up. It still feels a bit surreal,\" Wesselink said about the Olympic qualification.\n\n\"When we knew we could borrow Sarah's sled this week, we thought we might get a good result. But eighth place is surprising even for us.\"\n\nSo good, in fact, that the arrangement will continue all the way to the Games.\n\n\"We can borrow this two-man bobsled again next week for the World Cup in Altenberg and probably during the Games as well,\" Wesselink said.\n\n\"There are no rules that wouldn't allow that.\"\n\nAs for Blizzard, she's more than thankful to the Dutch team and is happy to repay them.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"It's kind of like a big family, bobsleigh,\" Blizzard said.\n\n\"Everyone helps everyone. Quite often, if you need a bolt and you're at the track, someone's gonna have something and they don't mind you using it.\n\n\"Sometimes you gotta buy a case of beer or some wine or something, but everyone is incredibly helpful and a lot of people have helped me over the years.\n\n\"A lot of people have loaned me things, so I'm glad that I can repay it in a way, but I'm more than happy to help these guys, they help me so much and they've been trying so hard to get these results.\n\n\"And they deserve it.\"\n\nHopefully Blizzard's kind deed will be repaid with a spot of her own at the Games.",

        "text": "There is an unwritten rule that guides the interaction between journalists and politicians at press conferences.\n\nThe politician gets to make an uninterrupted opening statement about whatever they want to talk about or announce.\n\nThe journalists indulge them with a handful of questions on this topic.\n\nAnd then questions shift to \"other matters\" \u2013 any issue under the sun that is in that day\u2019s news cycle.\n\nSA premier becomes emotional during press conference Peter Malinauskas becomes tearful during a media conference where he faces extensive questions about the crisis surrounding Adelaide Writers' Week and allegations of homophobia against Adelaide United made by former player Josh Cavallo.\n\nFor South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas, one \"other matter\" in particular followed him around for the entirety of the past week.\n\nThe intense media interest in Adelaide Writers' Week\u2019s stunning implosion \u2013 accompanied by the dizzying crossfire of allegations, legal threats, blistering resignations and personal invective (some of which has been directed at the premier) \u2013 largely overshadowed what was likely meant to be a well-planned rollout of Labor pre-election announcements.\n\nOn Sunday, the premier fronted the cameras to announce a new opening date for the Adelaide Aquatic Centre. He received 10 questions about Writers' Week.\n\nOn Monday, it was $18.5 million for IVF rebates (11 questions about Writers' Week); on Tuesday, $200 million for Mount Barker infrastructure (eight questions about Writers' Week); and on Wednesday, a $12 million loan for a Port Augusta cement project (13 questions about Writers' Week).\n\nPeter Malinauskas fielded questions about Adelaide Writers' Week during a press conference in Port Augusta. (ABC News)\n\nTo get a sense of the frustration it has caused a government trying to move on from a negative story, consider the premier\u2019s reaction on Wednesday when he was asked a question on a different subject.\n\n\"Really? There's other matters? There\u2019s other things people care about?\" Mr Malinauskas quipped.\n\n\"Sorry, I\u2019m just trying to recalibrate my brain to someone asking me a question that\u2019s not about Writers' Week.\"\n\nA government in control\n\nThe Malinauskas government\u2019s inability to get Writers' Week out of the news cycle is noteworthy considering its track record of sucking the oxygen out of a negative story.\n\nTake, for example, its failure to meet its past election promise to fix the ambulance ramping crisis.\n\nWhen the monthly ramping statistics are dropped, ministers routinely cite aged care bed block as a reason for hospital strain, telling reporters they are \"throwing the kitchen sink\" at the issue.\n\nThe ramping figures, which are usually released on a Friday or Saturday, get a smattering of media coverage on the lower-rating weekend nights, and by Monday, the news cycle has moved along.\n\nThe strategy compares to that of their Liberal opponents, who, in the final days of their 2022 election campaign, struggled to divert the media\u2019s attention away from ambulance response issues and health system failures.\n\nWriters\u2019 Week was something different.\n\nRanda Abdel-Fattah was set to appear at Adelaide Writers' Week to discuss her new novel Discipline. (ABC RN: Jennifer Wong)\n\nEvery day \u2013 sometimes every hour \u2013 there was something new that moved the story along and further out of the Labor government\u2019s control.\n\nThe former Adelaide Festival board\u2019s announcement last Thursday that it had \u2013 after receiving written support from the premier \u2013 disinvited Palestinian Australian author Randa Abdel-Fattah over her controversial commentary on Israel and Zionism was quickly followed by the withdrawal of about 180 authors.\n\nBy Saturday, former Adelaide Festival leaders were pressuring the board to reverse its decision; by Sunday, the board\u2019s chair and three other directors had resigned; and by Tuesday, the 2026 event was cancelled after the exit of the entire festival board and Writers\u2019 Week director Louise Adler, who resigned in protest of what she termed \"an act of cultural vandalism\".\n\nLouise Adler said the board's decision to cancel Abdel-Fattah came despite her \"strongest opposition\". (ABC News/7.30)\n\nThis type of criticism on a national platform is not something this government has been accustomed to, particularly given Mr Malinauskas\u2019s leadership on issues like the teen social media ban and political donations reform.\n\nCome Wednesday, Abdel-Fattah was threatening defamation action against the premier and by Thursday, the government\u2019s newly appointed board had reversed almost everything done by the old board \u2013 re-inviting Abdel-Fattah to the 2027 event and apologising to her \"for the harm the Adelaide Festival Corporation has caused her\".\n\nThe new board\u2019s reversal staved off a boycott from the Adelaide Festival\u2019s headline act Pulp, whose withdrawal would have done untold further damage to the 2026 event.\n\nWhile the board\u2019s reversal could be interpreted as a rebuke of Mr Malinauskas\u2019s view, Adelaide Festival executive director Julian Hobba on Thursday expressed an appreciation for the premier\u2019s \"consistent position that the curatorial choices of Adelaide Festival, including Adelaide Writers' Week, are at the discretion of the organisation\".\n\nWhat do people care about?\n\nWhen the festival cancelled Writers\u2019 Week, Mr Hobba said his feelings around the event were like \"[going] back to your property after it's been burned down by a bushfire\".\n\nBut has Labor\u2019s likely March election victory also been damaged in the Writers\u2019 Week blaze?\n\nParty figures on both sides of the aisle are very sceptical.\n\nAs one Labor source said on the controversy: \"Not every interesting news story shifts a material amount of voters.\"\n\nIf there is to be any fallout from the last week, it would likely be contained to the inner-city seats of Adelaide, Dunstan, Unley and possibly Bragg.\n\nDisaffected Labor voters in those electorates could potentially shift to the Greens or an independent, but it is unlikely they would shift to the Liberal Party, which has backed the premier\u2019s view on Abdel-Fattah.\n\nAdelaide Writers' Week is the biggest literary festival in Australia. (ABC News: Evelyn Manfield)\n\nThe premier has repeatedly said that Writers\u2019 Week was not his focus and that many voters were on the same page.\n\n\"While everyone\u2019s doing the naval gazing around Writers' Week \u2013 and I get that, I\u2019m not suggesting it\u2019s unimportant \u2013 I\u2019ve actually been out there making policy announcements that change people\u2019s lives,\" he said on Friday.\n\n\"In regional South Australia they\u2019re not talking about Writers' Week.\n\n\"In fact, I suspect in many dinner tables across the state they\u2019re not talking about Writers' Week because people have got real lives worrying about issues that are immediate to them.\"\n\nNot to mention all those voters who agree with the premier\u2019s approach to the issue or questioned the curation of the event.\n\nThe premier has also repeatedly pointed to the board\u2019s role when asked about the unfolding crisis.\n\n\"I think the people who run the festival, which is the board \u2026 have got this into a pretty awful situation, which is unfortunate,\" he said on Monday.\n\nAdelaide Writers' Week was cancelled on Tuesday after days of furore. (ABC News)\n\nThe government has also pointed reporters to comments made by Jewish-American author Thomas Friedman, who told the Sydney Morning Herald on Thursday he was invited to appear at the 2024 Adelaide Writers\u2019 Week, but was told by email a few days later \"that the timing would not work out\".\n\nAbdel-Fattah has previously said she objected to Friedman's attendance at the festival in 2024, over the language he used about the Middle East in a New York Times article entitled \"Understanding the Middle East Through the Animal Kingdom\".\n\nThe future of Writers' Week\n\nWhile the Writers' Week story might lose some steam next week, there is no sign it is going away.\n\nThe success of this year's Adelaide Festival will be under intense scrutiny, as will the artistic direction of Writers' Week in 2027. (The Jewish Community Council of South Australia's Norman Schueler has already called on the state government to defund the event).\n\nThe potential remains for a high-stakes legal case between the premier and Abdel-Fattah, as does the return of the Palestinian Australian author \u2013 and Louise Adler \u2013 to the festival fold.\n\nIn other words, Writers' Week will likely remain one of those \"other matters\" for a long time to come.",

        "text": "Steve Smith has eclipsed David Warner by scoring a 41-ball century and setting a Big Bash record as the Sydney Sixers claimed a five-wicket victory over the Sydney Thunder.\n\nAfter Warner had whacked 110 not out off 65 balls at the SCG on Friday, setting the Sixers a target of 190 to win, Smith stepped up and upstaged his long-time international teammate.\n\nThe Test batsman crunched 100 in an electric knock, which included five fours and nine sixes.\n\nSmith briefly threatened to race to the fastest BBL ton (39 balls) but still left the SCG with a record to his name.\n\nAfter overruling Babar Azam to take the strike in the power surge, the former Australian captain punished Ryan Hadley with four back-to-back sixes in an over.\n\nIn total, the Sixers batter humiliated the Thunder bowler by dispatching him for a record 32 runs off a single over.\n\n\"We knew we had to go hard from the outset because Davey played a beautiful knock,\" Smith told Kayo Sports.\n\n\"I got off to a really good start with Babar. I thought he played really nicely, we got a partnership together, and that set the foundation, and we went on from there.\"\n\nAzam was dismissed for 47 off 39 deliveries shortly after being denied the strike, ending a 141-run opening stand between him and Smith.\n\nAs he walked off the ground, the star Pakistan recruit fumed and smacked the boundary rope with his bat.\n\nNot only did Smith give Hadley a hard night, but he also stole Warner's limelight and hope of pulling off an upset for the Thunder.\n\nBattling a knee complaint that ruled him out of Monday's loss to the Melbourne Renegades, the 39-year-old Warner raced to a fourth-straight 50 and left the Sixers' bowlers second-guessing themselves as he brought up his ton.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nWarner's knock takes him top of the BBL run scoring charts, and the veteran batsman even made light work of Mitchell Starc, playing his first game in the competition in 11 years, by sending the Test bowler for a six over backward point.\n\nBut any sense that would be enough to secure a win, and put a dent in the Sixers' finals hopes, was put to bed by a 141-run opening stand between Azam and Smith.\n\nOn a rapid outfield, Smith was in fine touch from the get-go before falling for 100 when he was stumped by Sam Billings as he came down the wicket to Tanveer Sangha.\n\nThe fall of Smith briefly opened the door for the Thunder after Moises Henriques, Sam Curran and Josh Philippe had all departed for single-figure scores.\n\nBut Jack Edwards (17 not out) thrashed Hadley for a six to give the Sixers a win with 16 balls to spare.\n\nThe Sixers moved up to fourth with the win and can lock in a finals berth by beating the Brisbane Heat on Sunday.\n\nAAP",

        "text": "Becker got his nose in front 14-12 in a final set that lasted more than two hours. Instead of packing his bags and again making an early trip to the airport, then 23-year-old Becker went on to claim the title, stopping Ivan Lendl from winning three in a row, and securing the world No.1 ranking for the first and only time in his career.\n\n\u201cWe can say tanking,\u201d Camporese recalled when asked to explain the 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-5), 0-6 mid-match scoreline. \u201cWhen I made the second break [in the third set], he tanked a little bit. He takes the energy for the fourth set.\u201d\n\nIn typical gruelling January heat on court one (which later became Margaret Court Arena), Becker won the first two sets in tie-breakers, but slumped to a 6-0 deficit in the third, setting the scene for a thrilling finale.\n\nBut what followed was far from regulation. In fact, it was brutal, as Camporese \u2013 the world No.45 \u2013 pushed Becker to the limit for five hours and 11 minutes \u2013 at that point the longest match in the event\u2019s history .\n\nIt was 1991, Becker, 23, already had three Wimbledon titles and a US Open crown when he faced little-known Italian Omar Camporese in what, theoretically, shaped as a straightforward third-round match for the No.2 seed at the Australian Open.\n\nLong before Boris Becker\u2019s life spiralled into scandal and a prison term, the German \u2013 arguably the biggest star of tennis in the late 1980s \u2013 dodged a bullet in Melbourne.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nIn 1996, Becker was again triumphant at the Australian Open, beating Michael Chang. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I had a grand slam left in me,\u201d he said afterwards.\n\nSeven years before his \u201991 breakthrough, just days after his 17th birthday, he made the quarter-finals at the Open on Kooyong\u2019s grass, a harbinger to him becoming Wimbledon\u2019s youngest ever male champion just months later.\n\nBecker\u2019s dazzling career included a number of big moments in Australia; the final two of his six career slams came in Melbourne.\n\n\u201cWinning a grand slam [event] is very difficult. Very, very few players go through the rounds, not losing a set \u2013 that\u2019s not normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, for me it was good memories, for him, not so good,\u201d Becker told this masthead.\n\nThis year\u2019s Australian Open marks 30 years since Boris Becker\u2019s 1996 win over Michael Chang - the sixth and final grand slam title of his career. Credit: Getty Images\n\nDecades later, Becker fondly remembers the match and the day, confirming that he and Camporese reflected on it late last year at the ATP Finals in Turin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an open secret that Novak and me are still very close. It was a wonderful time being his coach, his mentor, and we kept a close friendship ever since,\u201d Becker said.\n\nWhen Australia was gripped by Nick Kyrgios\u2019 charge to the Wimbledon final and a showdown against Djokovic three-and-a-half years ago, the German was watching on too \u2013 but from a prison cell. Djokovic had invited Becker\u2019s partner (Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro, whom the German later married) and Becker\u2019s eldest son Noah into his players\u2019 box for the first round.\n\nIn his own words, featured in documentaries and a book published last year that detailed his incarceration, Inside \u2013 Winning. Losing. Starting Again, Becker has been humbled by the strong arm of the law.\n\nOne of the biggest names in tennis history, a highly successful player who was by Novak Djokovic\u2019s side as his coach for six of the Serbian\u2019s 24 grand slam titles, Becker fell foul of authorities for serious white-collar offences (tax evasion in Germany more than 20 years ago and, more recently, breaches of the UK\u2019s Insolvency Act). In 2022, he was jailed by British authorities for 2\u00bd years, though Becker served far less time than that in exchange for deportation to Germany.\n\nBut for all the on-court highs, there have been many more headline-grabbing lows.\n\nBut his 2022 situation was more serious and had far greater ramifications. He faced 29 counts under the Insolvency Act, and though five were dropped before the trial and he was acquitted of 20, he was convicted on four.\n\nIt was April four years ago when he was jailed in the UK for hiding millions of pounds worth of assets after being declared bankrupt in 2017. He had been found guilty of tax evasion charges in Germany two decades earlier but escaped with a suspended prison sentence \u2013 though he was fined \u20ac500,000.\n\nBecker is also commonly remembered for a paternity suit that stemmed from a brief encounter with Russian model Angela Ermakova at London\u2019s Nobu restaurant in 1999.\n\nBecker has been synonymous with juicy tabloid stories for decades \u2013 since he famously surged into the public\u2019s consciousness with his first Wimbledon success as a fresh-faced teen. Only late last year the 58-year-old became a father for the fifth time when Lilian gave birth to a baby girl.\n\n\u201cThroughout all these matches, in particular in the final, I saw my wife and my son \u2026 rooting for him. That was a very emotional time while I was inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThings are looking \u2026 maybe not so good. My money is \u2026 let\u2019s just say it could be working better,\u201d he wrote in Inside, reliving the thoughts that dominated his prison flashbacks.\n\nBecker\u2019s financial woes are myriad. In his book, the German gave a glimpse of how his finances were spiralling out of control in 2013.\n\n\u201cYou have lost your career, reputation and all of your property as a result of your bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nPointedly, in sentencing, judge Deborah Taylor criticised Becker for a lack of remorse, telling the German, \u201c[you] sought to distance yourself from the offending in your bankruptcy\u201d.\n\nThe country that played host to three of his grand slam victories, at Wimbledon, also witnessed his downfall.\n\nHe described himself as \u201casset rich but cash poor\u201d, losing deals and not earning enough to keep up with the demands of his lifestyle.\n\nHe described spending more to try to get his assets saleable, and struggling to pay the interest on loans worth millions of euros. But it was good money chasing bad.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cThis is when the sinking feeling kicks in. At first, the interest rate from [the private bank] has been manageable \u2013 five per cent. But there\u2019s trouble ahead. I\u2019m losing sponsors and I\u2019m losing endorsements. My public image is not where it was. Endless tabloid stories, one shit headline after another,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThings start falling apart, in Germany and then everywhere else. Broadcasting is OK. They still want me to talk about tennis. I still want to talk about tennis. The rest of it is terrible. I\u2019m losing big contracts early. Mercedes I\u2019ve been with for ages, but now they say they have a different marketing plan, going forward. I\u2019m not making any new contracts to replace the ones that disappear.\u201d\n\nOnce sentenced, Becker served time at London\u2019s notorious HMP Wandsworth prison \u2013 coincidentally close to the famed Wimbledon precinct \u2013 before being transferred to HMP Huntercombe.\n\nAs a German national living in the UK, he was eligible for an early release scheme that expedites the deportation of foreign prisoners. After serving only eight months of his sentence, he was released in December that year and sent to his native country.\n\nIn Inside, Becker points out that in other jurisdictions, his crimes would not have been dealt with so harshly.\n\n\u201cLet me just say that there was so much nonsense written about me leading up to my trial,\u201d he told this masthead.\n\n\u201cI felt the necessity and the urge just to put matter-of-factly [in the book] things that happened and didn\u2019t happen to me \u2013 and also what I was acquitted for and, and what I was sentenced for.\n\n\u201cOnce you just read it [my case] unemotionally, you\u2019ll be surprised that someone would be sentenced for something like that, but UK law is different to German law, [it\u2019s also] different to Italian law, so for the same mistakes, shall I say, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten a penalty in Germany [or] Italy.\n\n\u201cBut on the other hand, I\u2019m the last one is pointing fingers at other people, right. I\u2019ve done my mistakes. I\u2019ve paid my dues.\u201d\n\nToo successful, too young?\n\nBecker speaks frankly now about his early career experiences, and readily admits that winning Wimbledon while still green behind the ears probably did more harm than good.\n\n\u201cI think it [my story] really starts [with] winning Wimbledon at 17, and people start calling you a wunderkind, obviously you\u2019re bound to meet a lot of people \u2013 some are good and some are not so good for you,\u201d said Becker, who was also a celebrity poker player in retirement.\n\nThat moment at the All-England club in 1985. Credit: Fairfax archives\n\n\u201cBut you are too young to realise who has true value, who is sincere and who\u2019s not, and that really [has been my situation] all the way up [for me] until my 40s.\u201d\n\nAsked about the salient lessons from his life story, one of Becker\u2019s key messages is \u201cnot to lose faith\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been many, many, examples of how to deal with [winning] Wimbledon [at] 17 because nobody [else] has done it,\u201d he said.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cThat set me up for a very different life than a normal teenager or a normal young, young man that starts into life. But the key is always choose your friends wisely. Also after a big high, there could be a big low, and after a big low, there could be a big high.\n\n\u201cLife\u2019s long, life\u2019s a marathon, and yes, you have some good years, and you have some bad years, but important is [it] to continue and not to lose faith, and ultimately listen to your family and have a couple of good friends on the side.\u201d\n\nThe Australian connection\n\nAustralians, and a range of experiences playing tennis in Australia, are intertwined in the storied Becker career.\n\nWhen farewelled to Wimbledon\u2019s centre court in 1999, it was Pat Rafter who delivered the knockout blow.\n\nWhen the elusive Australian Open title first fell his way 35 years ago, it was an Australian coach, Bob Brett, smiling with satisfaction in the stands.\n\nBecker on his way to his maiden Australian Open title in 1991. Credit: Allsport UK\n\nAnd when the German was striving for a third straight Wimbledon title in 1987 as one of the hottest players in the game, duelling it out with Stefan Edberg and Lendl among others, a little-known Australian, Peter Doohan, shocked him in a famous second-round boilover. Incidentally, Doohan\u2019s moment in the sun helped pave the way for Pat Cash to claim the title that year.\n\nDespite a chequered record in Australia, the stars aligned for Becker in 1991. Pete Sampras had won his first major only months before at the US Open but was missing due to shin splints. John McEnroe, too, was absent with a shoulder injury.\n\nIn that epic match against Camporese, there was another helpful intervention.\n\n\u201cI lost because [at] 12-12 \u2026 I think it was 40-15 and I was serving \u2026 Steffi Graf came to see the match,\u201d Camporese said.\n\n\u201cI was really in love with her. I saw her \u2026 I was a little bit distracted.\u201d\n\nA dejected Omar Camporese in 1991. Credit: Craig Golding\n\nA week or so later, his he Once Becker got past Camporese, he only had to eliminate Wayne Ferriera, Guy Forget and Patrick McEnroe \u2013 yes, John McEnroe\u2019s little brother \u2013 in the semis to reach his first Australian men\u2019s final. There Becker overcomeovercame a 1-6 opening set to silence ruthless Czech Lendl in four sets in the final.\n\nBecker\u2019s pivotal career moment was his to celebrate \u2013 though for a worrying period he couldn\u2019t be found. After the buzz of match point, the German had dashed from centre court.\n\nFormer Tennis Australia president Geoff Polland recalls the confusion.\n\n\u201cAs I remember with Becker, we were getting ready for the presentation, and he disappeared!,\u201d Pollard said with a chuckle.\n\n\u201cJust when I was starting to worry a bit more, he reappeared!\u201d\n\nBecker explains the moment with a smile.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cI was actually on my way running back to the hotel \u2013 not to the river \u2013 because I felt like I\u2019ve been fighting for this number one spot for so long that I just wanted to be with myself,\u201d Becker said, recalling that a \u201cphysically strong\u201d security guard caught up with him.\n\n\u201cHe must have been quicker than I was. He followed me, and he explained to me that the whole world is waiting, and I have to take the trophy and I have to say a couple of words.\u201d\n\nThe 1996 win over Chang was the cherry on top of more than a decade of elite tennis.\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s been five years since I spoke last time to you,\u201d Becker said in his on-court acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cTo tell you the truth I didn\u2019t think I had a grand slam left in me.\u201d\n\nBecker\u2019s relationships and the rocky road\n\nHaving reached a financial rock bottom but granted the chance to \u201cstart again\u201d with his deportation from the UK, Becker and Lilian, who stuck with him during the tumult of his life, choose to live in Italy.\n\nAsked last year to explain how an individual who had generated the wealth he had through tennis could end up in his predicament, Becker tried to provide some context \u2013 that he played at a time when prize money hadn\u2019t yet soared through the roof.\n\n\u201c[But] of course I was wealthy,\u201d Becker adds.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I didn\u2019t earn tens of millions,\u201d Becker said on the High Performance podcast.\n\n\u201cAnother wrong story.\n\n\u201cIf you were playing now I would earn that type of money, but in the 80s and 90s, you didn\u2019t earn that type of money.\n\n\u201cWhat was the prize money for a Wimbledon champion in 1985? \u00a3300,000 before taxes \u2013 which in 1985 was a shitload of money, right? Today the winner makes \u00a33 million, so multiply everything that we earnt \u2013 it\u2019s 10-fold.\n\n\u201cThe prizemoney I\u2019ve won \u2013 it\u2019s $US25 million \u2013 that\u2019s before taxes and before costs. In my pocket was probably half, which is still a lot of money, but it\u2019s not \u2018tens of millions\u2019.\n\n\u201c[But yes] I was wealthy. Of course, I was wealthy.\u201d\n\nBecker met Lilian in 2018, and says the fact he \u201cfound relatively late in life such a woman \u2026 I\u2019m blessed, I\u2019m lucky. I didn\u2019t expect that\u201d.\n\n\u201cGod blessed me with a very special person,\u201d Becker said on the podcast.\n\n\u201c[In] 2018 I was in trouble. I was insolvent. I was not in a good state at all. So I meet her and I thought she was very interesting.\n\n\u201cI ended up going back to Frankfurt every couple of weeks to meet her. But she didn\u2019t want to meet me alone. She said \u2018I didn\u2019t know you [at] first, but I Googled you and you sound like trouble. So I stay away from you\u2019. I said \u2018probably good advice\u2019.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cI\u2019m persistent when I want something. It took me 10 months just to get her number.\n\n\u201cLook, clearly without her, I wouldn\u2019t be the man I am today.\u201d\n\nBarely two months after Lilian gave birth to their daughter, Zo\u00eb Vittoria, Becker \u2013 who will cover the Australian Open for Eurosport Germany \u2013 feels he\u2019s again bouncing back from adversity.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful, time in my life,\u201d he says.\n\nBut, if given the chance, would he have done things differently?\n\n\u201cLook I always, I always wanted to have a very intense life,\u201d he tells this masthead.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to be the best in tennis \u2026 as a player, as a coach, as an expert. And I was happy I could have many different roles within the tennis world, and I feel like I know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\n\u201cOther than that, I\u2019m a curious customer, right. I like to explore life.\n\n\u201cI like to understand different cultures, and I think I\u2019m a little bit wiser for it by now.\n\n\u201cBut in order to get there I had to do, many, many, many turns \u2013 some were in the right streets and some were in the wrong streets.\u201d\n\nFollow our live Australian Open blog each day from January 18 for results, news, analysis and interviews.\n\nNews, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size To appreciate aerial skier Laura Peel\u2019s relationship with yoga, it pays to understand the extreme nature of her sport. Peel\u2019s good friend and Winter Olympics gold medallist Lydia Lassila has a unique way of putting it into perspective. Imagine being an Olympic swimmer, she says, with all of its physical and mental demands, and then throwing a crocodile in the pool. Now you are getting close.

You kind of feel, not anxious, but you have always got a certain level of nervousness.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdd in the demands of a gruelling competition and the thrill of performing, and it\u2019s a heady mix. One that the summer Olympians might never understand. \u201cI think it\u2019s different to the likes of a swimmer,\u201d Lassila says. \u201cThey are not diving in and thinking, \u2018Shit, I might really hurt myself\u2019. Unless they are swimming from a crocodile, then they\u2019ll have some sense of what it is like being an extreme athlete.\u201d Peel has been an extreme athlete at the highest level since 2009. The former gymnast is now 36 and a veteran of the Australian team heading into the 2026 Olympics. Laura Peel has taken aerial skiing to new heights in recent years. Credit: FIS But her ability to deal consistently with the mental and physical pressures can be traced back to 2015 when she found herself in a rut, a low point that led her to yoga. She had come out of ankle surgery, wasn\u2019t training, was living at home in Canberra and became frustrated at \u201cgetting in my own way\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou know, I think I was feeling a little bit sorry for myself,\u201d Peel explains. \u201cI had some back-to-back injuries, we\u2019d had a lot of... coaching instability in our program, and I didn\u2019t feel like I was doing my best. And I didn\u2019t feel like I was at my best. \u201cI went to yoga for something physical, but I think there was just, like, little titbits of things that I picked up, and it really helped me to look at the positive side of things and see opportunities rather than obstacles. \u201cAnd then after that year [2015], when I went back to training, I went back a lot more positive. I felt like I went back a different athlete. I was just happier and healthier. When things went wrong, it wasn\u2019t the end of the world.\u201d Peel is in Melbourne with the Australian team, taking part in a series of pre-Games interviews.

I feel lucky to be able to so far dictate that I\u2019m still going.\u201d Peel has competed at the past three Winter Olympics, including as flag bearer at Beijing in 2022 where she finished fifth. She is also a two-time World Champion. But one medal has continued to elude her grasp - Olympic gold. All that could be about to change, according to Lassila, who won gold in the event at Vancouver in 2010 following Alisa Camplin\u2019s breakthrough victory at Salt Lake City in 2002.

She\u2019s right in the box seat to win an Olympic gold medal. That\u2019s the reality of it.\u201d Lassila and Peel first when they roomed together at snow camp at the end of 2009 in Ruka, Finland. Peel was 20 at the time. \u201cLaura was just getting going with her career. I think she was doing single flips,\u201d Lassila recalls of her rookie teammate. \u201cI think I was very focused on what I was doing at the time, but knowing that they were always watching and learning.\u201d Fast forward 15 years and Peel is no longer a novice. She is the sport\u2019s No.1 ranked athlete \u2013 the third time she has won the World Cup Crystal Globe for topping the rankings \u2013 and is regularly landing triple somersaults.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Donald Trump is in physical possession of a Nobel Peace Prize medal, gifted to him by last year's winner, Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut according to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, no matter what happens to the 18-carat gold medal, the prize itself \"remains inseparably linked to the person or organisation designated as the laureate\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe organisation issued a statement making its position clear on Saturday, after Machado gave her award to the United States president during a meeting at the White House this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe committee noted that laureates receive a gold medal, a diploma and prize money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is and remains the original laureate who is recorded in history as the recipient of the prize,\" the statement said.\n\n\n\n\"Even if the medal or diploma later comes into someone else\u2019s possession, this does not alter who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prize cannot be shared with others, transferred, or revoked, the committee said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The decision is final and applies for all time.\"\n\n\n\nHas this happened before?\n\nThere are no restrictions on what a Nobel laureate can do with the medal, diploma or prize money. They are free to keep them, give them away, sell or donate them if they wish.\n\n\n\n\n\nA number of Nobel laureates have opted to sell or give away their medals.\n\n\n\n\n\nNane Annan, widow of 2001 peace prize laureate Kofi Annan, donated the medal and diploma to the United Nations Office in Geneva, where they are permanently on display.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Could Donald Trump win the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize?\n\nIn 2022, Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov sold his peace prize medal for US$103.5 million ($154.8 million) and donated the entire sum to a UNICEF fund for Ukrainian refugee children.\n\n\n\n\n\nNorwegian author Knut Hamsun, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1920, gifted his medal to Germany's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, a prominent Nazi, as a gesture of thanks after they met in 1943.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat medal's current whereabouts are unknown, the Nobel Committee noted.\n\n\n\nOthers have also sold their medals, loaned or donated them to museums.\n\n\n\nWhy did Machado give her medal to Trump?\n\nTrump has made no secret of his desire to win the prize. Foreign leaders seeking to curry favour with him have previously put him up for it and hailed his peacemaking efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\nA White House spokesperson complained in October that Trump was snubbed for the 2025 award because the Nobel Committee prioritised \"politics over peace\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the time, the Trump administration was prominently spearheading an effort to broker peace in Gaza.\n\n\n\nMachado dedicated her award to Trump after it was announced , saying Venezuela was counting on Trump and other key allies to achieve freedom and democracy. She thanked him for his \"decisive support of our cause\".\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the US carried out a lightning strike in Caracas , kidnapping Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to face drug trafficking charges in New York in a move widely seen as illegal by international law experts.\n\n\n\n\n\nMachado presented her prize to Trump at the White House during their first face-to-face meeting on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\"Mar\u00eda presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you Mar\u00eda!\" Trump wrote on social media after the meeting.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was widely interpreted as an effort to gain influence as the future of Machado's country \u2014 currently led on an interim basis by Maduro's former deputy Delcy Rodriguez \u2014 hangs in the balance .\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has previously dismissed suggestions that Machado could be installed as Venezuela's leader, saying she does not have enough support among its people.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "They might have a reputation as \"rats with wings\", but to some, the humble pigeon is an \"athlete of the sky\". That's how Stevan Gazzola sees them, at least.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe keeps around 2,000 racing pigeons in his backyard, an hour outside Melbourne, and has been racing them for more than 30 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I started when I was 16 and I've been racing for 30 years now on and off. This year, we won the overall championship,\" Gazzola tells SBS News. \"It's in the blood.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEven so, his Italian family were baffled when he first got into the sport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My uncle got into me that I was chasing the wrong type of birds,\" he says. \"It's just grown. I'm too far in \u2014 I even bought acreage just for pigeons.\"\n\n\n\nThe 'dying' world of pigeon racing\n\nHoping to reinvigorate a sport he says is quietly disappearing, Gazzola launched the Meadow One Loft Race four years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nEach year, hundreds of pigeons are entered from across Australia \u2014 owners pay $350 per bird \u2014 and Gazzola takes them in, vaccinates, feeds, trains, and eventually releases them up to 400km away to race home.\n\n\n\nStevan Gazzola has been racing pigeons for most of his life. But he's worried the sport is dying. Source: SBS News \"People from all over Australia send me their baby pigeons,\" he says. \"We pick them up from the airport, then we vaccinate them, look after them, train them, let them go.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining builds gradually: short flights around the block first, then 10km, then 50km, then 100 km, and so on. He's seen top birds fly 1,000km in eight hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final race offers $75,000 to the winner, with around $250,000 paid out overall. But overseas, it's a different story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're racing for a million dollars,\" he says. \"I can send pigeons to Thailand \u2014 it's a $1,000 per pigeon to enter \u2014 and they're racing for $2.5 million in prize money.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, he says it isn't a money-making sport, with the small coin he might win at local races going straight back to the pigeons. \"You don't do this to get rich,\" he says.\n\n\n\nA sport running out of time\n\nBut Melbourne's pigeon racing scene is dying.\n\n\n\n\n\nMembership at Gazzola's local club has dropped from around 300 to about 90.\n\n\n\n\n\nRacers are ageing. Many are on pensions. Keeping birds requires space, money, time, and physical labour \u2014 all of which are increasingly scarce.\n\n\n\nStevan Gazzola says there's a science to breeding pigeons \u2014 especially if you want them to be racers. Source: SBS News \"They're just dying off. There's no young people joining,\" he says. \"You put in all the hard work and try to keep it going, but as the guys are getting older. They either die or they give up because they can't do it anymore.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSome owners send their pigeons to Gazzola, who becomes a kind of foster carer \u2014 feeding, housing and training birds on behalf of people who can't.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, he has noticed a small resurgence in young migrant communities. \"A lot of young Filipinos and Afghans are getting into it here,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Forty years ago, there was nothing to do. You either played footy or cricket \u2014 or raced pigeons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But it is a dying sport. Who wants to sit in their backyard and clean pigeon shit these days?\"\n\n\n\nEnter: The 'crazy pigeon lady'\n\nIn Melbourne's CBD, the scene couldn't be more different.\n\n\n\n\n\nTahlia \u2014 known as 'Frill' to her 300,000+ social media followers \u2014 can often be found outside Victoria's State Library, enveloped by a cloud of pigeons.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 26-year-old \u2014 and her rainbow coloured hair \u2014 started posting videos of herself and pigeons in January and within months, her content went viral.\n\n\n\n26-year-old Frill finds and treats 'stringfoot' pigeons in the hope of changing people's perception of the humble bird. Source: Supplied / Instagram / Frill_underscore \"I'm the crazy pigeon lady,\" she jokes. \"It's great that everyone is tuning in for the pigeons, but if I'm honest, the hair probably had a lot to do with it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn her messenger bag are the tools of the trade: bird seed, sanitiser, nail scissors, and a sock she calls \"pigeon jail\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHer mission: find and treat 'stringfoot' pigeons, whose toes have been strangled by string, thread, or human hair \u2014 leading to a painful condition that can cut off circulation and sometimes lead to the loss of toes, or even the entire foot.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo help a pigeon, she gently lures it close with seed before pouncing on it and slipping it into the sock so it can't fly away. Then, she trims the string away from its feet \u2014 a task that can take up to twenty minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is likely a thread from a piece of clothing, that's pretty common,\" she says as she destrings one. \"A lot of the time, human hair and pet hair can get stuck around their feet, too.\"\n\n\n\nShe learnt these skills from Melbourne rescue groups filled with \"pigeon enthusiasts\". While she started with stringfoot cases, she now also takes sick or injured pigeons home to rehabilitate, carrying a small box with her whenever she heads out \"just in case\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Stringfoot is a small symptom of a bigger issue,\" she says. \"Humans cause man-made problems that affect all the animals around them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even [a person's] hair can do this to them.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMost days, a small crowd gathers to watch her feed the birds. Children ask to hold seeds. Teenagers hover, half-curious, half-mocking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You'll usually get a flock of people who want to join in,\" she says. \"Others will make fun of me \u2026 I get a lot of people who will do drive-by insults.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But a lot of people are genuinely curious \u2026 I have had people who thought I was torturing a pigeon or kidnapping it!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrill's favourite bird is Dovey, a gentle white pigeon who perches on her shoulder and Chicken Boy, who somehow always attracts another bird to sit on him.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's also outspoken about racing: \"I think pigeon racing is outdated.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Most pigeon racers lose part of their loft every year. They'll die, or they get lost and join other flocks. It's very common that they collapse from exhaustion \u2026 there's no benefit for the animal.\"\n\n\n\nThe Animal Justice Party's Georgie Purcell says the humble pigeon \u2014 or 'rock dove' \u2014 is a misunderstood, intelligent animal. Source: AAP / Diego Fedele The RSPCA says pigeon racing poses \"many welfare risks\", including susceptibility to predation, high physical demands on their bodies, and some birds veering off course and not returning home.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal Justice Party MP Georgie Purcell also condemns pigeon racing and says our perception of the bird needs to change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I am vehemently against this toxic so-called sport,\" Purcell tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Gazzola says while he understands views that racing can be cruel, bird welfare is foundational to his operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our pigeons are bred for endurance and are conditioned gradually with structured training, vet supervision, and careful monitoring,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When the sport is run responsibly with proper health checks, controlled training, safe race routes, and strong oversight, the birds compete in a way that aligns with their natural instincts to fly, navigate, and return home.\"\n\n\n\nAn underrated bird\n\nPurcell is one of many who are on Team Pigeon \u2014 including actress Sarah Paulson, who recently staunchly defended the bird and called for \"pigeon hate\" to be stopped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Pigeons are the best example of victims of mankind,\" Purcell says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They are an animal that humans used and domesticated for a purpose and then immediately discarded them when they were deemed to be no longer useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Now, we treat them as if they're a nuisance or something that must be eradicated.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says people often underestimate the humble pigeon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As highly sociable animals, pigeons mate for life, and they are a true representation of equal caring responsibilities, with both female and male pigeons working together to raise their young,\" Purcell said.\n\n\n\nGeorgie Purcell says pigeons are the \"best example of victims of mankind\", formerly domesticated, then left to their own.

While monkeys could learn the skill in a couple of months, it took the dear pigeon a year to be trained.\n\n\n\nRats with wings?\n\nDespite their differences, both Gazzola and Frill want people to rethink the humble pigeon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you mention pigeons, people say they're rats with wings,\" Gazzola says. \"They think of what we do here as the average street pigeon that's pecking at chips in the city and is a nuisance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he says his birds are \"probably kept better than how some people live\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're climate-controlled, heated, the food is spotless \u2014 we source the best vitamins from all over the world \u2014 there's no stone left unturned that they don't get,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're athletes of the sky.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFrill agrees that pigeons deserve care \u2014 but wants it to extend to all of them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of people say they're rats with wings \u2014 I also like rats, so that's not an insult to me \u2014 but it is meant in a derogatory way to say they're dirty and take up space on the street,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe wants to break that stigma: \"They have their own life and they feel and they have very complex social lives.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe also hopes her content will make people think more deeply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want people to appreciate every animal \u2014 even little street pigeons that people might not care about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want people to think more about the world around them and other animals and how we impact them.\"\n\n\n\n",

In Melbourne, often described as Australia\u2019s coffee capital, Asian-inspired trends are catching on. Cafe manager Jay Lee explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAustralian people like more balanced acidity and less sweetness drinks. Korean or Asian customers want something more sweeter and more creamer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile sales of classic coffees like flat whites and long blacks remain strong, many customers are sampling Asian-inspired blends derived from dessert making and tea brewing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe first thing I think of is infusion \u2014 like teas I think of the mixture of coffee and tea, and flavours I haven\u2019t tried before.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Cru+ caf\u00e9 in Melbourne\u2019s East, Jay Lee says producing exotic creations takes time, technique and precision.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAsian-style drinks usually involve more steps: syrup, powders, creams, and clear layer. Keeping everything consistent is harder than making classic Aussie order.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline survey platform, Pureprofile is researching our taste for fancy drinks. Australia\u2019s senior client development director, Kate Richards explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cConsumers want drinks that suit their mood, their energy levels, their diet, and their personal taste. And that flexibility beautifully extends to Asian inspired fusion flavours like matcha and pistachio. It's turning into beverage theatre. More than a caffeine boost, these drinks deliver texture, taste, and shareability. Presentation has become as important as flavour with dessert style lattes doubling as visually arresting performances.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nPureprofile\u2019s Social Insights tool found that Asian-inspired food and drink now accounts for 28 per cent of online share. Ms Richards says it\u2019s part of a broader pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cTrends like Instagram-worthy lattes are exploding in popularity right now. For example, TikTok views of pistachio matcha lattes more than doubled in eight months. Asian inspiration is everywhere, not only in food and beverages, but in categories like fashion, beauty, travel, and tech.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nA changing demographic may be driving the trend \u2013 with more than 17 per cent of people in Australia claiming Asian heritage. Among popular choices - hojicha latte \u2014 a creamy Japanese tea drink made from roasted green tea, or Earl Grey iced latte with salted cream. In the summer heat, many customers are looking for a cooler style, like grapefruit cold brew layered over sparkling water.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think this has a bit of grapefruit in it, from what I can see and taste. I think it might have cold brew.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nO ther drinks are inspired by Korean flavours, including the Kinako latte \u2014 a caffeine-free Japanese and Korean drink made from roasted soybean powder. Cru+ manager Jay Lee says broadening the caf\u00e9\u2019s range is good for business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s given the customers something they can\u2019t experience before \u2018inspired by the Japan, Japanese.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nOf the 400 coffees sold each day \u2014server Phillip Sim says demand for Asian styles is rising steadily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe try to create something special, something new. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s getting popular and popular.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, when it comes to a daily cup, not everyone is convinced. Caf\u00e9 owner Sam Wang.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u201cLong black, latte, cappuccino and flat white, these four different type of coffees are still our best-sellers.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "While housing continues to become less affordable in most Australian cities and regions, Melbourne has thrown up some data quirks that experts have linked to state government policies, with houses now cheaper to rent there than they were 12 months ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, the cost of renting a house or unit increased across Australia's combined capitals in the year leading up to December 2025, according to a new Domain report.\n\n\n\n\n\nMelbourne, consistently ranked the most liveable city in the nation , is now the cheapest capital city to rent a house in at an average of $580 per week, as asking prices hit the \"affordability ceiling\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of renting a house in Melbourne fell by 1.7 per cent over the year, the only drop of any property type in any Australian city, according to the report.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fall in value will have mixed results for renters, landlords and investors in Victoria, while the country grapples with a national shortage of new properties and low vacancy rates.\n\n\n\nWhat's caused values to fall?\n\nThe cost of renting a house in Melbourne fell $10 per week in the 12 months to December 2025, saving tenants $520 per year.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet units became more expensive in the city, rising from an average of $550 per week in December 2024 to $580 a year later \u2014 on par with house rents.\n\n\n\n\n\nMelbourne unit prices are cheaper on average per week than Sydney ($750), Brisbane and Perth (both $650), Darwin ($598) and on par with Canberra. Only Hobart and Adelaide have cheaper unit prices at $480 and $525 a week respectively.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Domain's chief of research and economics, Nicola Powell, told SBS News that housing supply has been stronger in Melbourne compared to other cities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think supply choice has been much better for tenants,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"And what that means from an asking rent perspective is landlords are having to be much more realistic on the price point they place on their home.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMelbourne had the highest vacancy rate of any capital in December at 1.6 per cent.\n\n\n\nMore first home buyers, fewer investors\n\nFederal and state government policies have also made a difference.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new national first-home buyers scheme \u2014 which allows all first-home buyers to put down a deposit of 5 per cent \u2014 has reduced demand for rentals as tenants look to purchase their first property, Powell explained.\n\n\n\nState taxation changes affecting Victorians who own, or are looking to buy, investment properties have led to an increase in the fees investment property owners pay.\n\n\n\n\n\nPowell said these changes have led to people offloading investment properties in the last couple of years and choosing to invest in other states.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proportion of investment in Victoria is one of the lowest in the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's sitting at just under 34 per cent of loans being financed to investors,\" Powell said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"NSW sits at 46 per cent. So you can see there's a vast difference in participation rates from investors.\"\n\n\n\nProperty Council research shows that investors are currently looking away from Melbourne due to its \"harsh tax settings\", and instead choosing states with less punitive property charges.\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Lowcock, Victorian deputy executive director of the Property Council, told SBS News that Melbourne's liveability has traditionally been underpinned by strong private investment in housing, infrastructure and amenity.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said for rents to stay low, investors need to be kept onside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"With that pipeline of investment dropping away, it is becoming harder to deliver the homes that current and future Victorians need,\" Lowcock said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If Victoria wants to stay competitive, we need to do more to encourage investment and create the conditions that encourage more homes to be built.\"\n\n\n\nNational data\n\nPowell predicted that the cost of renting in Melbourne would remain stable due to the \"affordability ceiling\" \u2014 the maximum a population can pay \u2014 being reached.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're certainly not seeing any indication that we're going to see rent suddenly start to accelerate,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Domain's December rental report, the most expensive houses per week in Australia are found in Sydney at $800.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was followed by Darwin, Canberra and Perth, where renting a house cost $700 per week on average.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News The cost of renting a unit has increased across the board since December 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney has the highest average weekly unit rent at $750, followed by Brisbane and Perth at $650 respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Overall competition for rentals is still quite strong, but I think affordability is increasingly capping how far and how fast rents can rise,\" Powell said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have to remember that Australia is still operating in a landlord's market, which means vacancy rates are below two per cent across every single capital city.\"\n\n\n\nHow can cities be both liveable and affordable?\n\nWhen grading Australian cities on metrics like health care, education, and infrastructure, Melbourne comes in first place, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2025 Global Liveability Index.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2025, Melbourne was ranked the fourth most liveable city in the world, followed by Sydney in sixth place and Adelaide in ninth.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Michaela lives eight hours from her young daughter \u2014 the rental crisis is now separating families\n\nKate Raynor, an urban planning expert with the University of Melbourne's Life Course Centre, explained why Melbourne ranks so highly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Melbourne does public spaces and public transport connectivity and safety in the public realm really well,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is less air pollution and historically has been quite affordable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe explained that Melbourne has a diversity of housing types and densities, which helps improve affordability as it's easier for people to move up and down the property ladder.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn top of its varied housing stock, Victoria approves more new homes than other Australian states, Raynor said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to 2025 Australian Bureau of Statistics data, Victoria accounted for 5,215 new home approvals in November out of the 18,406 reported nationwide. NSW followed with 4,848, while Queensland approved 4,558.\n\n\n\nDoes Melbourne offer lessons for other cities?\n\nCost of living presents challenges to liveability, Raynor said, which can make balancing a desirable area and cost-effectiveness difficult for governments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You want to be building amenities and infrastructure, but at the same time not drive people out with escalating prices,\" she said.\n\n\n\nShe said all cities, not just Melbourne, need to invest in more social housing and medium-density housing to continue thriving and keep renting affordable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Invest in social housing, because that is where the need is greatest, that's where the housing stress is greatest, and that is the most obvious and direct route from someone who is at risk of homelessness or severe housing stress into housing stability,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith any new housing also comes the need for transport infrastructure, she added, so that people aren't \"locked in\" to outer and developing suburbs.\n\n\n\n",

Skateboarding, writing, reading, art, music. I don't care what it is - but it's off the screen. Discovering who they are and forging connections in the real world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ban applies to social media, video and gaming platforms including X, Tik Tok, Instagram and YouTube and has the potential to be expanded.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcross just Meta's suite of platforms; including Facebook and Instagram, 550,000 user profiles were deactivated or removed.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Jessamy Perriam is a digital sociologist and Associate Director at the Australian National University School of Cybernetics.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe believes it is too soon to make a call on the under 16 ban's success.\n\n\n\n\n\n'It's impressive, but we just don't know in the longterm how it is going to pan out. And especially as we have young people returning to school at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. The truth of the success of this policy will really come out then I think.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nE-Safety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, says her office estimated 84 percent of 8 to 12 year olds had accounts before the ban was introduced in December.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the figures suggest social media companies are making meaningful efforts to comply with the law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We said please focus on the deactivations first, but we expect continued improvement. We expect you to prevent recidivism, so the creation of additional accounts. There are a range of signals they can take to prevent that from happening.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has become the world leader in what could be a global movement toward social media age restrictions, as nations including Malaysia and New Zealand - consider similar moves.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese says parents have spoken to him about the positive impact on their children's lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The fact that in spite of some skepticism out there, it is working and being replicated around the world is a source of Australian pride.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOther global restrictions are in the pipeline, too.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, law enforcement agencies have long sounded the alarm about the potential - and reality - of sexual exploitation of people on social media, particularly children.\n\n\n\n\n\nOvernight the Philippines became the third country to ban Grok, an artificial intelligence chat bot from Elon Musk's company, X,\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week it was revealed to have been producing a flood of explicit images of women and children.\n\n\n\n\n\nMalaysia has restricted the software, as has Indonesia.\n\n\n\n\n\nVia a statement on X, the company said it had made changes, including geoblocking certain content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis, in areas in which this is illegal. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers. Image creation and the ability to edit photos via X's Grok account is now only available to paid subscribers.\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nBritain and France are now applying pressure on the company, to make good on promised changes to stop the content.\n\n\n\n\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the British Parliament the company which owns the software, X, is on notice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have made it clear that X has to act. But if not, Ofcom has our full backing and will introduce and are introducing legislation. Mr Speaker, to update the House I have been informed this morning that X is acting to ensure full compliance with UK law. If so, that is welcome, but we are not going to back down.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia's Attorney General is investigating the software and Prime Minister Albanese, confirmed Australia has its sights on the issue, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The use of generative artificial intelligence to exploit or sexualise people without their consent is abhorrent. I know that the E-Safety Commissioner is looking at this. It is, once again, an example of social media not showing social responsibility. And Australians and indeed global citizens, deserve better.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDoctor Perriam says this is a moment that vindicates the under 16 ban in Australia - but hopes there will be some plasticity in the policy going forward.\n\n\n\n",

And at this moment in time, his opinion on that matter has not changed.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government says new figures showing the number of accounts deleted to comply with their social media ban is evidence that the reforms are working as intended.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunications Minister Anika Wells says more than 4.7 million under-16 accounts have been removed allowing young teenagers to discover who they are offline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They can spend a summer making real world connections with each other, with their siblings, with their parents. Skateboarding, writing, reading, art, music. I don't care what it is - but it's off the screen. Discovering who they are and forging connections in the real world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nESafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant says her office estimated 84 percent of 8 to 12 year olds had accounts before the ban was introduced in December.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the figures suggest social media companies are making meaningful efforts to follow the legislation .\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We said please focus on the deactivations first, but we expect continued improvement. We expect you to prevent recidivism, so the creation of additional accounts. There are a range of signals they can take to prevent that from happening.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Penny Wong has urged Australians to leave Iran immediately if possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Wong has condemned the Iranian government's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests that activists say have killed at least 2,677 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States has also threatened military retaliation for the protesters' deaths.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Foreign Minister advises all Australians to avoid the region for the foreseeable future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have advised Australians not to travel for to Iran. The security situation remains extremely volatile. If you are Australian and you are in Iran, we urge you to leave and if it is safe to do so. We do not have a bill the ability to provide consular assistance other than in the most extremely limited of circumstances.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nA new study suggests there are major treatment gaps for people experiencing depression.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research, from the University of Sydney Brain and Mind Centre, has found that while anti-depressants are routinely prescribed as a first treatment, they are not always effective.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study has found people with less common depression were less likely to respond to the medication and more likely to experience side effects such as weight gain.\n\n\n\n\n\nLead author Mirim Shin says depression is an illness experienced uniquely by everyone, and the treatment needs to be tailored to address this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport,\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian para skier Josh Hanlon has claimed a podium finish in the sitting downhill at the Para World Cup.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian para alpine skier was just 2.26 seconds off first-placed Jesper Pederson of Norway to take third place on the second day of competition at Saalbach.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Becker got his nose in front 14-12 in a final set that lasted more than two hours. Instead of packing his bags and again making an early trip to the airport, then 23-year-old Becker went on to claim the title, stopping Ivan Lendl from winning three in a row, and securing the world No.1 ranking for the first and only time in his career.\n\n\u201cWe can say tanking,\u201d Camporese recalled when asked to explain the 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-5), 0-6 mid-match scoreline. \u201cWhen I made the second break [in the third set], he tanked a little bit. He takes the energy for the fourth set.\u201d\n\nIn typical gruelling January heat on court one (which later became Margaret Court Arena), Becker won the first two sets in tie-breakers, but slumped to a 6-0 deficit in the third, setting the scene for a thrilling finale.\n\nBut what followed was far from regulation. In fact, it was brutal, as Camporese \u2013 the world No.45 \u2013 pushed Becker to the limit for five hours and 11 minutes \u2013 at that point the longest match in the event\u2019s history .\n\nIt was 1991, Becker, 23, already had three Wimbledon titles and a US Open crown when he faced little-known Italian Omar Camporese in what, theoretically, shaped as a straightforward third-round match for the No.2 seed at the Australian Open.\n\nLong before Boris Becker\u2019s life spiralled into scandal and a prison term, the German \u2013 arguably the biggest star of tennis in the late 1980s \u2013 dodged a bullet in Melbourne.\n\nAdd articles to your saved list and come back to them any time.\n\nIn 1996, Becker was again triumphant at the Australian Open, beating Michael Chang. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I had a grand slam left in me,\u201d he said afterwards.\n\nSeven years before his \u201991 breakthrough, just days after his 17th birthday, he made the quarter-finals at the Open on Kooyong\u2019s grass, a harbinger to him becoming Wimbledon\u2019s youngest ever male champion just months later.\n\nBecker\u2019s dazzling career included a number of big moments in Australia; the final two of his six career slams came in Melbourne.\n\n\u201cWinning a grand slam [event] is very difficult. Very, very few players go through the rounds, not losing a set \u2013 that\u2019s not normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, for me it was good memories, for him, not so good,\u201d Becker told this masthead.\n\nThis year\u2019s Australian Open marks 30 years since Boris Becker\u2019s 1996 win over Michael Chang - the sixth and final grand slam title of his career. Credit: Getty Images\n\nDecades later, Becker fondly remembers the match and the day, confirming that he and Camporese reflected on it late last year at the ATP Finals in Turin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an open secret that Novak and me are still very close. It was a wonderful time being his coach, his mentor, and we kept a close friendship ever since,\u201d Becker said.\n\nWhen Australia was gripped by Nick Kyrgios\u2019 charge to the Wimbledon final and a showdown against Djokovic three-and-a-half years ago, the German was watching on too \u2013 but from a prison cell. Djokovic had invited Becker\u2019s partner (Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro, whom the German later married) and Becker\u2019s eldest son Noah into his players\u2019 box for the first round.\n\nIn his own words, featured in documentaries and a book published last year that detailed his incarceration, Inside \u2013 Winning. Losing. Starting Again, Becker has been humbled by the strong arm of the law.\n\nOne of the biggest names in tennis history, a highly successful player who was by Novak Djokovic\u2019s side as his coach for six of the Serbian\u2019s 24 grand slam titles, Becker fell foul of authorities for serious white-collar offences (tax evasion in Germany more than 20 years ago and, more recently, breaches of the UK\u2019s Insolvency Act). In 2022, he was jailed by British authorities for 2\u00bd years, though Becker served far less time than that in exchange for deportation to Germany.\n\nBut for all the on-court highs, there have been many more headline-grabbing lows.\n\nBut his 2022 situation was more serious and had far greater ramifications. He faced 29 counts under the Insolvency Act, and though five were dropped before the trial and he was acquitted of 20, he was convicted on four.\n\nIt was April four years ago when he was jailed in the UK for hiding millions of pounds worth of assets after being declared bankrupt in 2017. He had been found guilty of tax evasion charges in Germany two decades earlier but escaped with a suspended prison sentence \u2013 though he was fined \u20ac500,000.\n\nBecker is also commonly remembered for a paternity suit that stemmed from a brief encounter with Russian model Angela Ermakova at London\u2019s Nobu restaurant in 1999.\n\nBecker has been synonymous with juicy tabloid stories for decades \u2013 since he famously surged into the public\u2019s consciousness with his first Wimbledon success as a fresh-faced teen. Only late last year the 58-year-old became a father for the fifth time when Lilian gave birth to a baby girl.\n\n\u201cThroughout all these matches, in particular in the final, I saw my wife and my son \u2026 rooting for him. That was a very emotional time while I was inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThings are looking \u2026 maybe not so good. My money is \u2026 let\u2019s just say it could be working better,\u201d he wrote in Inside, reliving the thoughts that dominated his prison flashbacks.\n\nBecker\u2019s financial woes are myriad. In his book, the German gave a glimpse of how his finances were spiralling out of control in 2013.\n\n\u201cYou have lost your career, reputation and all of your property as a result of your bankruptcy.\u201d\n\nPointedly, in sentencing, judge Deborah Taylor criticised Becker for a lack of remorse, telling the German, \u201c[you] sought to distance yourself from the offending in your bankruptcy\u201d.\n\nThe country that played host to three of his grand slam victories, at Wimbledon, also witnessed his downfall.\n\nHe described himself as \u201casset rich but cash poor\u201d, losing deals and not earning enough to keep up with the demands of his lifestyle.\n\nHe described spending more to try to get his assets saleable, and struggling to pay the interest on loans worth millions of euros. But it was good money chasing bad.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cThis is when the sinking feeling kicks in. At first, the interest rate from [the private bank] has been manageable \u2013 five per cent. But there\u2019s trouble ahead. I\u2019m losing sponsors and I\u2019m losing endorsements. My public image is not where it was. Endless tabloid stories, one shit headline after another,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThings start falling apart, in Germany and then everywhere else. Broadcasting is OK. They still want me to talk about tennis. I still want to talk about tennis. The rest of it is terrible. I\u2019m losing big contracts early. Mercedes I\u2019ve been with for ages, but now they say they have a different marketing plan, going forward. I\u2019m not making any new contracts to replace the ones that disappear.\u201d\n\nOnce sentenced, Becker served time at London\u2019s notorious HMP Wandsworth prison \u2013 coincidentally close to the famed Wimbledon precinct \u2013 before being transferred to HMP Huntercombe.\n\nAs a German national living in the UK, he was eligible for an early release scheme that expedites the deportation of foreign prisoners. After serving only eight months of his sentence, he was released in December that year and sent to his native country.\n\nIn Inside, Becker points out that in other jurisdictions, his crimes would not have been dealt with so harshly.\n\n\u201cLet me just say that there was so much nonsense written about me leading up to my trial,\u201d he told this masthead.\n\n\u201cI felt the necessity and the urge just to put matter-of-factly [in the book] things that happened and didn\u2019t happen to me \u2013 and also what I was acquitted for and, and what I was sentenced for.\n\n\u201cOnce you just read it [my case] unemotionally, you\u2019ll be surprised that someone would be sentenced for something like that, but UK law is different to German law, [it\u2019s also] different to Italian law, so for the same mistakes, shall I say, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten a penalty in Germany [or] Italy.\n\n\u201cBut on the other hand, I\u2019m the last one is pointing fingers at other people, right. I\u2019ve done my mistakes. I\u2019ve paid my dues.\u201d\n\nToo successful, too young?\n\nBecker speaks frankly now about his early career experiences, and readily admits that winning Wimbledon while still green behind the ears probably did more harm than good.\n\n\u201cI think it [my story] really starts [with] winning Wimbledon at 17, and people start calling you a wunderkind, obviously you\u2019re bound to meet a lot of people \u2013 some are good and some are not so good for you,\u201d said Becker, who was also a celebrity poker player in retirement.\n\nThat moment at the All-England club in 1985. Credit: Fairfax archives\n\n\u201cBut you are too young to realise who has true value, who is sincere and who\u2019s not, and that really [has been my situation] all the way up [for me] until my 40s.\u201d\n\nAsked about the salient lessons from his life story, one of Becker\u2019s key messages is \u201cnot to lose faith\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been many, many, examples of how to deal with [winning] Wimbledon [at] 17 because nobody [else] has done it,\u201d he said.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cThat set me up for a very different life than a normal teenager or a normal young, young man that starts into life. But the key is always choose your friends wisely. Also after a big high, there could be a big low, and after a big low, there could be a big high.\n\n\u201cLife\u2019s long, life\u2019s a marathon, and yes, you have some good years, and you have some bad years, but important is [it] to continue and not to lose faith, and ultimately listen to your family and have a couple of good friends on the side.\u201d\n\nThe Australian connection\n\nAustralians, and a range of experiences playing tennis in Australia, are intertwined in the storied Becker career.\n\nWhen farewelled to Wimbledon\u2019s centre court in 1999, it was Pat Rafter who delivered the knockout blow.\n\nWhen the elusive Australian Open title first fell his way 35 years ago, it was an Australian coach, Bob Brett, smiling with satisfaction in the stands.\n\nBecker on his way to his maiden Australian Open title in 1991. Credit: Allsport UK\n\nAnd when the German was striving for a third straight Wimbledon title in 1987 as one of the hottest players in the game, duelling it out with Stefan Edberg and Lendl among others, a little-known Australian, Peter Doohan, shocked him in a famous second-round boilover. Incidentally, Doohan\u2019s moment in the sun helped pave the way for Pat Cash to claim the title that year.\n\nDespite a chequered record in Australia, the stars aligned for Becker in 1991. Pete Sampras had won his first major only months before at the US Open but was missing due to shin splints. John McEnroe, too, was absent with a shoulder injury.\n\nIn that epic match against Camporese, there was another helpful intervention.\n\n\u201cI lost because [at] 12-12 \u2026 I think it was 40-15 and I was serving \u2026 Steffi Graf came to see the match,\u201d Camporese said.\n\n\u201cI was really in love with her. I saw her \u2026 I was a little bit distracted.\u201d\n\nA dejected Omar Camporese in 1991. Credit: Craig Golding\n\nA week or so later, his he Once Becker got past Camporese, he only had to eliminate Wayne Ferriera, Guy Forget and Patrick McEnroe \u2013 yes, John McEnroe\u2019s little brother \u2013 in the semis to reach his first Australian men\u2019s final. There Becker overcomeovercame a 1-6 opening set to silence ruthless Czech Lendl in four sets in the final.\n\nBecker\u2019s pivotal career moment was his to celebrate \u2013 though for a worrying period he couldn\u2019t be found. After the buzz of match point, the German had dashed from centre court.\n\nFormer Tennis Australia president Geoff Polland recalls the confusion.\n\n\u201cAs I remember with Becker, we were getting ready for the presentation, and he disappeared!,\u201d Pollard said with a chuckle.\n\n\u201cJust when I was starting to worry a bit more, he reappeared!\u201d\n\nBecker explains the moment with a smile.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cI was actually on my way running back to the hotel \u2013 not to the river \u2013 because I felt like I\u2019ve been fighting for this number one spot for so long that I just wanted to be with myself,\u201d Becker said, recalling that a \u201cphysically strong\u201d security guard caught up with him.\n\n\u201cHe must have been quicker than I was. He followed me, and he explained to me that the whole world is waiting, and I have to take the trophy and I have to say a couple of words.\u201d\n\nThe 1996 win over Chang was the cherry on top of more than a decade of elite tennis.\n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s been five years since I spoke last time to you,\u201d Becker said in his on-court acceptance speech.\n\n\u201cTo tell you the truth I didn\u2019t think I had a grand slam left in me.\u201d\n\nBecker\u2019s relationships and the rocky road\n\nHaving reached a financial rock bottom but granted the chance to \u201cstart again\u201d with his deportation from the UK, Becker and Lilian, who stuck with him during the tumult of his life, choose to live in Italy.\n\nAsked last year to explain how an individual who had generated the wealth he had through tennis could end up in his predicament, Becker tried to provide some context \u2013 that he played at a time when prize money hadn\u2019t yet soared through the roof.\n\n\u201c[But] of course I was wealthy,\u201d Becker adds.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, I didn\u2019t earn tens of millions,\u201d Becker said on the High Performance podcast.\n\n\u201cAnother wrong story.\n\n\u201cIf you were playing now I would earn that type of money, but in the 80s and 90s, you didn\u2019t earn that type of money.\n\n\u201cWhat was the prize money for a Wimbledon champion in 1985? \u00a3300,000 before taxes \u2013 which in 1985 was a shitload of money, right? Today the winner makes \u00a33 million, so multiply everything that we earnt \u2013 it\u2019s 10-fold.\n\n\u201cThe prizemoney I\u2019ve won \u2013 it\u2019s $US25 million \u2013 that\u2019s before taxes and before costs. In my pocket was probably half, which is still a lot of money, but it\u2019s not \u2018tens of millions\u2019.\n\n\u201c[But yes] I was wealthy. Of course, I was wealthy.\u201d\n\nBecker met Lilian in 2018, and says the fact he \u201cfound relatively late in life such a woman \u2026 I\u2019m blessed, I\u2019m lucky. I didn\u2019t expect that\u201d.\n\n\u201cGod blessed me with a very special person,\u201d Becker said on the podcast.\n\n\u201c[In] 2018 I was in trouble. I was insolvent. I was not in a good state at all. So I meet her and I thought she was very interesting.\n\n\u201cI ended up going back to Frankfurt every couple of weeks to meet her. But she didn\u2019t want to meet me alone. She said \u2018I didn\u2019t know you [at] first, but I Googled you and you sound like trouble. So I stay away from you\u2019. I said \u2018probably good advice\u2019.\n\nLoading\n\n\u201cI\u2019m persistent when I want something. It took me 10 months just to get her number.\n\n\u201cLook, clearly without her, I wouldn\u2019t be the man I am today.\u201d\n\nBarely two months after Lilian gave birth to their daughter, Zo\u00eb Vittoria, Becker \u2013 who will cover the Australian Open for Eurosport Germany \u2013 feels he\u2019s again bouncing back from adversity.\n\n\u201cObviously, it\u2019s a wonderful, wonderful, time in my life,\u201d he says.\n\nBut, if given the chance, would he have done things differently?\n\n\u201cLook I always, I always wanted to have a very intense life,\u201d he tells this masthead.\n\n\u201cI always wanted to be the best in tennis \u2026 as a player, as a coach, as an expert. And I was happy I could have many different roles within the tennis world, and I feel like I know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\n\u201cOther than that, I\u2019m a curious customer, right. I like to explore life.\n\n\u201cI like to understand different cultures, and I think I\u2019m a little bit wiser for it by now.\n\n\u201cBut in order to get there I had to do, many, many, many turns \u2013 some were in the right streets and some were in the wrong streets.\u201d\n\nFollow our live Australian Open blog each day from January 18 for results, news, analysis and interviews.\n\nNews, results and expert analysis from the weekend of sport sent every Monday.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size To appreciate aerial skier Laura Peel\u2019s relationship with yoga, it pays to understand the extreme nature of her sport. Peel\u2019s good friend and Winter Olympics gold medallist Lydia Lassila has a unique way of putting it into perspective. Imagine being an Olympic swimmer, she says, with all of its physical and mental demands, and then throwing a crocodile in the pool. Now you are getting close.

You kind of feel, not anxious, but you have always got a certain level of nervousness.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdd in the demands of a gruelling competition and the thrill of performing, and it\u2019s a heady mix. One that the summer Olympians might never understand. \u201cI think it\u2019s different to the likes of a swimmer,\u201d Lassila says. \u201cThey are not diving in and thinking, \u2018Shit, I might really hurt myself\u2019. Unless they are swimming from a crocodile, then they\u2019ll have some sense of what it is like being an extreme athlete.\u201d Peel has been an extreme athlete at the highest level since 2009. The former gymnast is now 36 and a veteran of the Australian team heading into the 2026 Olympics. Laura Peel has taken aerial skiing to new heights in recent years. Credit: FIS But her ability to deal consistently with the mental and physical pressures can be traced back to 2015 when she found herself in a rut, a low point that led her to yoga. She had come out of ankle surgery, wasn\u2019t training, was living at home in Canberra and became frustrated at \u201cgetting in my own way\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou know, I think I was feeling a little bit sorry for myself,\u201d Peel explains. \u201cI had some back-to-back injuries, we\u2019d had a lot of... coaching instability in our program, and I didn\u2019t feel like I was doing my best. And I didn\u2019t feel like I was at my best. \u201cI went to yoga for something physical, but I think there was just, like, little titbits of things that I picked up, and it really helped me to look at the positive side of things and see opportunities rather than obstacles. \u201cAnd then after that year [2015], when I went back to training, I went back a lot more positive. I felt like I went back a different athlete. I was just happier and healthier. When things went wrong, it wasn\u2019t the end of the world.\u201d Peel is in Melbourne with the Australian team, taking part in a series of pre-Games interviews.

Loading \u201cI feel good,\u201d she says. \u201cNot everybody\u2019s body or mind allows them to keep going for as long as they would like. I feel lucky to be able to so far dictate that I\u2019m still going.\u201d Peel has competed at the past three Winter Olympics, including as flag bearer at Beijing in 2022 where she finished fifth. She is also a two-time World Champion. But one medal has continued to elude her grasp - Olympic gold. All that could be about to change, according to Lassila, who won gold in the event at Vancouver in 2010 following Alisa Camplin\u2019s breakthrough victory at Salt Lake City in 2002.

She\u2019s right in the box seat to win an Olympic gold medal. That\u2019s the reality of it.\u201d Lassila and Peel first when they roomed together at snow camp at the end of 2009 in Ruka, Finland. Peel was 20 at the time. \u201cLaura was just getting going with her career. I think she was doing single flips,\u201d Lassila recalls of her rookie teammate. \u201cI think I was very focused on what I was doing at the time, but knowing that they were always watching and learning.\u201d Fast forward 15 years and Peel is no longer a novice. She is the sport\u2019s No.1 ranked athlete \u2013 the third time she has won the World Cup Crystal Globe for topping the rankings \u2013 and is regularly landing triple somersaults.\n\nAdvertisement",
