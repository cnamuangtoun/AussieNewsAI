(Supplied)\n\nChair of the community cooperative, Richard House, said it was selling ownership shares to connect locals in the town to the hotel and each other.\n\n\"I think it's good for mental health that they can go there on an evening, after work and go talk about issues that are happening or happening at the farm,\" he said.\n\n\"A pub isn't just a place to drink, you've got to have meals \u2026 families have got to be able to go there.\"\n\nAn architect's impression of the Gnowangerup pub after planned renovations. (Supplied)\n\nMore pubs are going co-op\n\nThirty kilometres down the road, the Broomehill Village Co-op purchased its local pub in 2022 after it closed in 2019.\n\nThe hotel has been closed for about six years, but plans are underway to renovate the historic building and reopen it.\n\nBroomehill Village Co-op chairman Scott Thomas said a township of 200 people now featured 96 pub shareholders.\n\nNorth of Broomehill, Kulin and Nyabing also purchased their respective pubs under cooperative models, both of which are up and running.\n\nBroomehill's Imperial Hotel was built in 1902. This photo was taken circa 1910. (Supplied: State Library of WA)\n\nProfessor Amanda Davies, a social demographer at the University of Western Australia, said places to connect were of particular importance in regional communities.\n\n\"Community pubs and sporting associations are super important to rural communities for the impact that they can have on social wellbeing across a longer period,\" she said.\n\nProfessor Davies said the roles of the local pub had changed in recent times, a factor that had led to the rise of the co-op model.\n\n\"It's not just a matter of survival \u2014 where a community group is purchasing a pub, they're changing the nature of that space and it's having some really wonderful impacts across quite a lot of communities,\" she said.\n\n\"With high levels of connectivity, there is a change in dynamic going on across our society.\"\n\nProfessor Amanda Davies says high house prices are pushing people back to small country towns.

(ABC Great Southern: Rhys Jones )\n\nMr Jeffries said copying what worked in one regional community would not necessarily translate into success in another.\n\n\"The key is adapting the model to fit the town's size, needs, and resources \u2014 not just copying what works in a bigger centre,\" he said.\n\n\"Communities like Gnowangerup are showing that with the right planning and support, these models can thrive and keep vital services alive in the bush.\"\n\nMark Shenton says the cooperative pub model helped spread risk in a volatile market.

We're seeing more regional businesses experiment with hybrid models,\" he said.\n\n\"It's all about spreading risk and creating multiple income streams, which makes a business more resilient in a small market.\n\n\"In a place like Gnowangerup, success comes from locals backing locals, and models that give the community real skin in the game.\"",

        "text": "Amazon has revealed the cause of Monday's massive outage that sparked global turmoil among thousands of sites, including some of the web's most popular apps such as Snapchat and Reddit.\n\nThe disruption knocked workers from London to Tokyo offline, and stopped others from conducting everyday tasks such as paying hairdressers or changing their airline tickets.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), which hosts applications and computer processes for companies around the world, revealed in a lengthy statement that a string of events triggered the outage.\n\nAmazon says the problems stemmed from a \"latent defect\". (AP: Kiichiro Sato)\n\nIt said the problems stemmed from a \"latent defect\" in what is known as the Domain Name System, or DNS.\n\nThis prevented applications from finding the correct address for AWS's DynamoDB API, a cloud database relied upon to store user information and other critical data.\n\n\"We apologise for the impact this event caused our customers,\" the statement read.\n\n\"We know how critical our services are to our customers, their applications and end users, and their businesses.\n\n\" We know this event impacted many customers in significant ways. \"\n\nThe AWS cloud service returned to normal operations on Monday afternoon, local time.\n\nAWS is a subsidiary of Amazon. (Reuters: Anushree Fadnavis)\n\nCalls for better fault tolerance\n\nThe outage was the largest internet disruption since last year's CrowdStrike malfunction hobbled technology systems in hospitals, banks and airports, highlighting the vulnerability of the world's interconnected technologies.\n\nWhy the AWS outage was such a big deal Millions of apps, websites and services rely on AWS, one of the world's largest cloud computing platforms. Here's what we know about the outage.\n\nIt was at least the third time in five years that AWS's northern Virginia cluster, known as US-EAST-1, contributed to a major internet meltdown.\n\nAmazon did not address a request for more clarity about why that particular data centre keeps being affected.\n\nEarlier, AWS said the root cause of the outage was an underlying subsystem that monitored the health of its network load balancers used to distribute traffic across several servers.\n\nThe issue, AWS said, originated from within the \"EC2 internal network\", Amazon's \"Elastic Compute Cloud\" service, which provides on-demand cloud capacity within AWS.\n\nAmazon has more than 100 computing warehouses in Virginia. (AP: Jonathan Ernst)\n\nKen Birman, a computer science professor at Cornell University, said software developers needed to build better fault tolerance.\n\nHe said AWS provided tools developers could use to protect themselves in the event of a problem at one of any of its sprawling network of data centres, and developers could also create backups with other cloud providers.\n\n\"When people cut costs and cut corners to try to get an application up, and then forget that they skipped that last step and didn't really protect against an outage, those companies are the ones who really ought to be scrutinised later,\" Mr Birman told Reuters.\n\nABC/Reuters",

He invites members of the audience up onto stage to sit with him, and he tells you his autobiographical story.\"\n\nEast Perth Power Station to light up again\n\nThe stand-out success of last year's festival, the transformation of the derelict East Perth Power Station into Casa Musica, which offered the contemporary music programming, food, drink and light projections by the Swan River, is back with plans to make the venue bigger this year.\n\nThe derelict old East Perth Power Station transforms into the festival's contemporary music venue, Casa Musica.

We want more food and beverage,\" Reece said.\n\n\"We need more furniture because so many people came down, and we want more art on the walls and around the places and spaces that the power station offers our audiences.\"\n\nWith the Perth Concert Hall closed until 2028 for extensive renovations, the festival is exploring new venues.\n\nA Philip Glass opera based on Franz Kafka's The Trial will play in an empty office space above Myer in the CBD.\n\nAnother production, simply dubbed Secret Opera, will be performed in an undisclosed location.\n\nThe Perth Town Hall will once again become a re-imagined Embassy Ballroom and St Mary's Cathedral will hold a series of choral and chamber music called the Sanctum Series.\n\nIn Let Me In, Let Me Out, Hugo Flavelle takes audiences on a tour of venues and spaces that remain inaccessible. (Supplied: Lincoln Mackinnon/Perth Festival)\n\nOpening with a reel\n\nNotably absent from the program are large-scale free public opening and closing events.\n\nWhile thousands once flocked to walk with giant puppets, wandered among the lit-up trees in Kings Park or celebrated Bon Scott with an all-day party that closed a 10-kilometre stretch of highway, this year's event, A View from a Bridge, is a more pared-back affair that people can take in on their phones from anywhere in the world.\n\nCreated by London-based artist Joe Bloom, the digital project will use Matagarup Bridge and an old red landline to create a work that will be shared with audiences on Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.\n\n\"[Joe] puts an old dial-up red phone of his mother's on a bridge and he invites you to pick that phone up,\" Reece said.\n\n\"Then Joe is hundreds of metres away on the other side of the phone and he speaks to you, and because you are standing on a bridge suspended in time and space, there's just something about people being a lot more honest and a lot more vulnerable.\n\n\"What he's done is collected these extraordinary stories, these confessions, these jokes, these provocations from all of these different people who live and work in London across the London bridges.\n\n\" As he films, he slowly zooms out so eventually this human is tiny, tiny, like dwarfed by the bridge and by the rest of its city. \"\n\nBloom will spend a week in Perth filming stories, which will then be uploaded online.\n\nL\u00e9 N\u00f8r [the rain] involves a faux foreign film performed live each night by theatre company The Last Great Hunt. (Supplied: Daniel Grant Photographer/Perth Festival)\n\nReece conceded it might disappoint audience members used to a more traditional outing, but said she hoped they would take the opportunity to explore other events dotted around the city.\n\n\"You've always got to choose how you carve up your budget,\" she said.\n\n\"For me, the decision, at least for last year and this year, has been the East Perth Power Station, lots of different events in different neighbourhoods across the city, rather than, for want of a better word, a one-hit wonder for thousands of people.\"\n\nCosts double after COVID\n\nWhile the festival gets a grant from the state government through Lotterywest and attracts funding from private and corporate donors, Reece said budgets were always tight, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, and ticket sales only covered 30 per cent of the festival's costs.\n\n\"The thing that's happened since COVID is that everything, especially in regards to international theatre, to freight, to flights, everything's doubled,\" she said.\n\nWhat that has meant, Reece said, is that rather than bringing international acts exclusively to Perth, she and her team looked to work closely with other festivals so that a performer or company could be brought to Australia for multiple events, and costs could be shared.\n\n\"This idea of exclusivity, of one show only coming to Perth and nowhere else in Australia, that's just not realistic anymore,\" she said.\n\n\"We've got to find ways to work together, to share great work across the country, and then find these little gems that really make Perth Festival stand out and celebrate our own identity and relevance in the community.\n\n\" I always try and find work that's relevant, work that is going to make people curious, work that will entertain and provoke and bring a lot of joy to Perth. \"",

        "text": "Scientists who recently travelled to Heard Island in the Southern Ocean fear a deadly strain of bird flu, H5N1, may be infecting wildlife after observing unusually high mortality among elephant seals on the volcanic island.\n\nWarning: this story contains graphic images of carcasses.\n\nSamples taken from the seals have been carefully packaged aboard the RSV Nuyina and will be tested on the ship's return to the mainland.\n\nIs the strain of bird flu in Australia?\n\nAustralia is the only continent free of H5N1 but has been on high alert for its potential arrival, particularly given the devastating effects the disease has had on both wildlife and domestic animals in other countries.\n\nThe strain first emerged in 1996 in Asia and appeared in other parts of the world in the decades that followed, but outbreaks would usually fizzle out among wild bird populations.\n\nThat changed in 2020 as a new version of the virus \u2014 known as H5N1 2.3.4.4b \u2014 emerged.\n\nDeadly strain of bird flu suspected on Heard Island Suspected bird flu has reached Australia's sub-Antarctic Heard Island, with signs of the deadly H5 avian disease observed in elephant seals.\n\nIn 2022, it mutated and spread quickly across the globe, infecting tens of thousands of seals and hundreds of thousands of wild birds and dairy herds in the United States.\n\nIt has continued to circulate among wild birds and made its way around the globe.\n\nAustralia has been preparing for an incursion of H5 bird flu for years, with a $95 million suite of biosecurity, environmental and public health funding announced in October.\n\nDoes the virus have the potential to become the next pandemic?\n\nSome experts fear the H5N1 bird flu could become the next pandemic, although there has been no known human-to-human transmission of the virus to date.\n\nOne study suggested that H5N1 bird flu in cows could spread to people relatively easily after showing that the virus could bind to a type of acid found in human airways, called sialic acids, and could then be spread to ferrets.\n\nThat suggested the virus could soon start to spread between different mammals, including humans, potentially leading to a new pandemic.\n\n'Time of trepidation' amid bird flu risk Experts are on edge, fearing this will be the spring that the \"catastrophic\" H5 strain of bird flu arrives in Australia.\n\nBut two separate studies cast doubt on those findings.\n\nThe first, by researchers in the United States and the United Kingdom, found that H5N1 in cows binds poorly to human sialic acids, suggesting the virus cannot spread easily from cows to people.\n\nThe second, by US scientists, looked at whether the virus binds more easily to receptors in birds than mammals, even after infecting cows, and found that to be the case.\n\nThe team found no evidence of a shift towards infecting humans or other mammals as the virus has spread and evolved, although this should be the subject of continuous monitoring, they say.\n\nIn the US, the virus has infected at least 70 people, who have worked directly with dairy cattle, including one person who died.\n\nMexico also reported its first human death in April, when a three-year-old girl died.\n\nSince 2020, there have been 112 human cases, including an Australian toddler who contracted the virus while visiting India before making a full recovery.\n\nOther countries where cases have been recorded include Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, China, India, a few in Europe, as well as the UK, South America and Canada.\n\nBut almost two-thirds have occurred in the US this past year.\n\nPerson-to-person spread is not considered an issue yet, but scientists argue the virus is one mutation away from \"pandemic potential\".\n\nScientists fear bird flu has reached species on Heard Island after observing high mortality in elephant seals. (Australian Antarctic Division: Rowena Hannaford)\n\nWhat is happening in the Antarctic?\n\nOutbreaks of the virus were detected on sub-Antarctic islands by French scientists last year on the remote Possession Island, the Crozet archipelago and Kerguelen Island.\n\nThe strain detected on Kerguelen was determined to have originated 7,000 kilometres away, at the South Georgia Islands.\n\nAustralia's remote Heard and McDonald Islands are less than 500km away from Kerguelen, which is why scientists made the recent voyage on the Nuyina to find out if the flu had made the jump.\n\nJulie McInnes, a wildlife ecologist at the Australian Antarctic Division, said initial drone and ground surveys of the island did not indicate any unusual levels of mortality.\n\nBut when the scientists made their way to the south-east of the island, dead elephant seals, including pups, were discovered.\n\nMeagan Dewar, who has made several research expeditions to Antarctica this year, told ABC's 7.30 in May that there had been detections of the disease in most seal species on the continent.\n\nThe Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research detected the virus in the region in 2023 after its jump from South America, spread by scavenging birds.\n\n'Pandemic potential' on our doorstep Australia is surrounded by the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu. And it is morphing as sea animals and birds bring it ever closer to these shores.\n\nMichael Ward from the University of Sydney Veterinary School said if confirmed on Heard Island, the risk of spread to mainland Australia remains low because the island is 4,000km away.\n\n\"It's interesting and it's progression, but it's not a seismic shift,\" he said.\n\n\"Not that many birds are travelling between there and the Australian mainland.\"\n\nProfessor Ward said tests will be completed once the Nuyina returns.\n\n\"It's got all the sort of telltale signs of influenza, but the fact it's only affecting one species, only seals, is a little bit strange,\" he said.\n\n\"It's on the move, and it seems to be a subtype that quite readily jumped species, so that's probably the big concern.\"\n\nThe remains of sea lions in Argentina affected by bird flu. (AP)\n\nWhy is a bird flu infecting other animals, and what species are at risk?\n\nThe deadly strain of bird flu has, so far, been identified in at least 15 species in the sub-Antarctic, from flying seabirds to penguins and seals.\n\nThe disease has devastated the international wild bird population, including the fragile ecosystem of Antarctica, with \"mass mortality events\" of birds such as Ad\u00e9lie penguins and skuas.\n\nIts genomic properties allow it to keep jumping species.\n\nIt has infected cats, dolphins, pigs, sheep, dogs, seals and tigers.\n\nIn March, H5N1 was detected for the first time in a sheep in the UK after being found in a single ewe in Yorkshire.\n\nScientists believe a deadly strain of bird flu was taken to Antarctica from South America by scavenging birds. (Supplied: Michelle Wille)\n\nWhat research is being done?\n\nA trial has started in the US to see if a vaccine against the flu has been effective in protecting the rare California condor.\n\nResearch has also been carried out by the CSIRO to see if the vaccine could be used in small Australian bird species.\n\nAnother possible pathway for the virus to enter Australia is from the north, with long-distance migratory birds returning from the northern hemisphere in spring, stopping at H5N1 hotspots along the way.\n\nIndigenous ranger groups are monitoring the vast north of Australia also for signs of the virus in wild birds.",

(ABC Broken Hill: Bill Ormonde)\n\nMs Moriarty described the potential mRNA vaccine as a world first.\n\nShe said it would be fast to manufacture, but the developers of the vaccine were still preparing to formally apply for regulatory approval with the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA).\n\nWhile mRNA vaccines have been approved for use in humans, the ABC understands no mRNA vaccine has been approved for animal use in Australia.\n\nAustralia has been free from FMD for more than 150 years but the disease has spread around the globe, including to nearby Indonesia in 2022.\n\nA widespread FMD outbreak here would bring Australia's livestock industries to a standstill and could cost the economy up to $80 billion over a decade, given it would likely take years to eradicate and restore export trade access.\n\nThe mRNA vaccine is part of a $20 million project funded by the NSW government and Meat & Livestock Australia, a research and development body funded by farmers and the federal government.\n\nAs part of the project, the University of NSW RNA Institute is currently preparing to manufacture the mRNA vaccine in the event of an emergency outbreak.\n\nCalls for more mRNA vax support\n\nMs Moriarty said the Commonwealth should be doing more to support the mRNA vaccine project, which was first announced by the NSW government in 2022.\n\n\"These viruses don't stop at state borders, and they don't stop at international borders \u2026 the Commonwealth are the government that has the most resources at their disposal, so I would call on them to be investing in more technology, to be investing in protecting our industry,\" Ms Moriarty said.\n\nIn response, Federal Agriculture Minister Julie Collins, responsible for the APVMA, said the federal government did \"take the threat of FMD seriously\".\n\nJulie Collins says her government is already helping to manage the risk of an FMD outbreak. (ABC News: Lauren Smith)\n\n\"The government invests in research for the benefit of the red meat industry through Meat & Livestock Australia, which has contributed to the development of the mRNA vaccine against FMD,\" she said.\n\nThe Australian government has access to an FMD vaccine bank overseas, which stores conventional FMD vaccines that could be accessed in event of a disease outbreak in Australia.\n\nThey are kept offshore because they contain the live virus.\n\nDevelopers of the potential mRNA vaccine have tested it in Germany in cattle exposed to FMD.\n\nAn APVMA spokesperson said it had not received an application for a FMD mRNA vaccine for use in livestock.\n\n\"If we do, it will be scientifically assessed to ensure that it satisfies the Agvet Code's rigorous safety, efficacy, and trade criteria,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nWhat is mRNA?\n\nMessenger RNA or mRNA is naturally occurring and carries instructions from DNA to create different proteins in the body's cells.\n\nmRNA vaccines work by creating artificial mRNA that instructs the body's cells to create spike proteins, the same those found in viruses.\n\nThe body recognises the new spike proteins as foreign and learns to identify and fight the real virus.\n\nTiba BioTech, the company working DPIRD on the new FMD vaccine, was established at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to develop mRNA vaccines for humans during the pandemic.\n\nChief financial officer Peter McGrath said it was the \"most simple way to create a vaccine\".\n\nPeter McGrath says the mRNA vaccine is effective in cattle against FMD, but it is yet to be approved. (ABC Landline: Ian Cutmore)\n\n\"It can be applied to multiple vaccines because it's a little bit like software \u2014 you just program it for whatever disease that you want to go after,\" he said.\n\n\"It's very exciting and really a game-changer for human and animal health.\n\n\" I'm a little bit surprised the federal government hasn't got behind this project in a more meaningful way. \"\n\nFMD does not affect humans but is highly contagious in sheep, cattle, pigs, goats, deer and camels.\n\nThe FMD mRNA vaccine has only been trialled in cattle, but scientists hope with more research it can be applied in other species.\n\nThe research team said it was already working on a similar mRNA vaccine to protect cattle from lumpy skin disease.\n\nWatch ABC TV's Landline at 12:30pm AEST on Sunday or stream anytime on ABC iview.",

(ABC News: Shari Hams)\n\nShe received bait shakers \u2014 handheld containers filled with granular bait \u2014 after being identified as living in an area given lower priority for treatment.\n\n\"I did send [the program] a message asking if someone could come and have a look and I heard nothing,\" she said.\n\nLoading...\n\nLack of communication\n\nMs Hooker said the lack of communication made the infestation extremely stressful, and she felt the bait shaker \"didn't work\" \u2014 unaware the eradication method takes several months to be effective.\n\nShe then spent hundreds of dollars at a local hardware store and attempted her own control methods, but has so far been unsuccessful.\n\nThe Invasive Species Council said eradication methods should be better communicated to residents who are feeling frustrated and overwhelmed.\n\nMs Hooker felt the bait shaker \"didn't work\". (ABC News: Shari Hams)\n\nDespite the fact that she is not the property owner, under the Biosecurity Act 2014, everyone has a general biosecurity obligation to take all reasonable and practical steps to reduce the risk posed by fire ants.\n\nReview launched into fire ant eradication effort Authorities launch an independent review of Australia's national fire ant eradication program.\n\nInvasive Species Council Manager Reece Pianta said he has heard from \"a lot of people\" in south-east Queensland who are confused about the program and frustrated by a lack of communication.\n\nMr Pianta said the suppression zones surround the main target area, those zones are where teams are actively deployed to locate and treat fire ant nests.\n\nThe program involves surveillance and baiting to target the fire ants, with aerial baiting using drones, helicopters and planes used for properties more than five hectares.\n\nSmaller areas are treated by utility vehicles or handheld spreaders around homes, buildings and waterways.\n\nLoading...\n\nBut Mr Pianta said large infestations like Ms Hooker's should be given higher priority under the program.\n\nHe said once fire ant populations reach densities of around 100 nests per hectare, they pose serious risks and could spread through soil or goods to other parts of the country, undermining eradication efforts.\n\nA spokesperson for the Fire Ant Suppression Taskforce said the program prioritises inspections where fire ants pose a public safety risk, such as at schools, playgrounds, or aged care facilities.\n\nFire ants have infested 850,000 hectares in Queensland and have been detected in northern NSW. (Supplied: Invasive Species Council)\n\nThey said Ms Hooker's leased land in Waterford West is within the \"suppression treatment area\", where residents are responsible for self-treating their properties.\n\nThe spokesperson did not address questions about the communication gap or explain why Ms Hooker wasn't informed that the treatment would take time to work.\n\nIn a statement, Logan City Council said Mayor Jon Raven has been a \"strong advocate for fire ant eradication\".\n\nThe council said it does not plan to send officers to inspect or manage red imported fire ants on private properties due to resourcing.\n\nMr Raven has called for increased funding and support to tackle the issue.\n\nMayor Jon Raven was part of a Canberra Council of Mayors delegation, where meetings were held to discuss fire ant eradication efforts.

(ABC News: Lucas Hill)\n\nIn a statement, Federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Julie Collins said the government takes the threat of fire ants seriously.\n\n\"Our government has committed nearly four times the previous commitment made to eradicate red imported fire ants,\" the statement said.\n\n\"We are taking a large share of the responsibility in the fight to eradicate the pest by providing just under $300 million through to 2027.\"\n\nA review by the National Fire Ant Eradication Program is due to report in December and will assess whether current funding is adequate and if the eradication target of 2032 can be met.\n\nJulie Collins says the government takes fire ant eradication very seriously.

        "text": "It has been nearly 100 years to the day that Tasmania's remote and rugged west coast played backdrop to an ambitious film project led by a Hollywood silent film starlet.\n\nConsidered a lost classic of Australian cinema, Jewelled Nights was mostly shot at Savage River, deep in the bush at an alluvial mine site.\n\nAt the time of its release, it was billed to be the making of Hobart as the \"Hollywood of the south\", but its production ran overtime, the budget overblown and its star never went on to make another film.\n\nAs for Jewelled Nights, only remnants of the silent film remains.\n\nOnly a few minutes of the silent film Jewelled Nights remains, but the musical score survived.\n\nThe film's restorer, Bernard Lloyd, previously said filming at that location would have been an extraordinary feat at the time.\n\n\"There was no road then, no track there and so to bring this film crew down there, two hours down the gully and then back out again each day, it was a huge ask with the weather, the snakes,\" Mr Lloyd said.\n\nThe film featured leading lady Louise Lovely, an Australian darling who had starred in about 50 Hollywood films, mostly by major production companies Universal, Goldwyn Picture Company and 20th Century Fox.\n\nFilm historians have said Lovely was the first Australian actress to find success in America.\n\nLouise Lovely played a female character who dressed as a man in order to try her luck at mining in the 1925 film Jewelled Nights. (Supplied: Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery)\n\nMarie Bjelke-Petersen \u2014 a prolific romance writer considered the Danielle Steele of her time \u2014 asked Lovely to star in and produce the film adaptation of one of her books.\n\nAt the time, both Lovely and Bjelke-Petersen were celebrities in their respective fields.\n\nIn an interview, Lovely said: \"Everyone said that good pictures could not be made in Australia. I have set out to prove that they can.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nFollowing its premiere in Melbourne in October 1925, Jewelled Nights reportedly screened to 350,000 people, more than a third of the city's population at the time.\n\nIts box office success propelled Tasmania and its dramatic landscape onto the big screen.\n\nBut now, only fragments of the silent film remain.\n\nFilm's intrigue inspires artwork\n\nThe film's allure has led local Tasmanian artist Jacqueline Dortmans on a deep dive.\n\nHer installation at this year's The Unconformity festival in Queenstown on Tasmania's west coast was a homage to the film and Bjelke-Petersen.\n\n\"The biggest mystery for me is the film, having been lost, there's no way to know how Louise Lovely [and her co-producer] told the story,\" Dortmans said.\n\n\"We can draw on the book, which tells the story clearly, but what's unclear is how they told the story in silent film.\n\n\"Silent film is not that well understood as a format.\n\n\"When you look at other silent films you recognise that they have this way of delivering a punch line just through a couple of words on a screen.\"\n\nJacqueline Dortmans says silent film is not a well understood format. (The Unconformity)\n\nDortmans said she leant heavily into that formula to convey her Jewelled Nights piece, a three-part journey into the book's setting, the script and its creators.\n\n\"It celebrates not just the achievements of Louise Lovely with the film, and the history that the film and book is grounded in, which is the osmiridium mining, but Marie Bjelke-Petersen as a person who is someone who should be more known in the Tasmanian context,\" she said.\n\n\"She was very forensic in her research.\n\n\"She spent time at Savage River and 19 Mile Creek talking to miners and gathering the information to allow her to write with quite impressive accuracy.\"\n\nRomance author Marie Bjelke-Petersen was a celebrity in her time. (Athol H Shmith)\n\nTasmanian mineral needed for fountain pens\n\nThe Jewelled Nights story begins with the fountain pen.\n\nAt the turn of last century, Tasmania was the world's only mined source of osmiridium, a mineral needed for the production of fountain pen nibs.\n\nFor years, gold prospectors on the Savage River system thought of the alloy as a nuisance as they panned for the more precious mineral. But, later, as osmiridium's value was realised, it fetched prices higher than gold.\n\nThe Burnt Spur mining site at Savage River has been given heritage listing. (Heritage Tasmania/JH Robinson)\n\nMiners quickly switched their alluvial techniques of gold panning to the search for osmiridium.\n\nThey worked streams by diverting water onto dry beds through stone wall channels and dams, many of which survive today.\n\nRough huts were also set up to house the temporary workforce, including prospector Jos Hancock's, at Flea Flat, which featured prominently in the film.\n\nThese early mining sites, Burnt Spur and Flea Flat, have recently secured permanent heritage listing with the Tasmanian Heritage Council.\n\nJos Hancock's hut at Flea Flat featured in Jewelled Nights. (Heritage Tasmania/JH Robinson)\n\nIn its submission for heritage recognition, the mines were described as presenting \"intact archaeological examples of alluvial mining features\" and having a \"special association with pioneering Australian actor and entrepreneur Louise Lovely\".\n\nSpeaking on ABC Radio Hobart, historian Nic Haygarth said of the location:\n\n\"Marie Bjelke-Petersen had this idea that Tasmania should be a second Hollywood as it had the wonderful scenery.\n\n\"She was a great advocate for Tasmania's rainforests and the scenery of the west coast.\"\n\nTasmania's wildness critical to film\n\nAt its heart, Jewelled Nights was a love story.\n\nOne where Tasmania's brooding landscape and expansive skies played a role in maintaining the romantic tension between the cross-dressing lead female and the miner she falls in love with.\n\nAt home with Louise Lovely Listen to Chris Wisbey as he explores the house and garden of the former silent film star.\n\nThe lead character, Melbourne socialite Elaine Fleetwood, flees to the osmiridium mines of distant Tasmania after leaving her groom at the altar.\n\nThere, she dresses as a man in order to work the mines as she has heard there were riches to be made.\n\nBut as film restorer Bernard Lloyd said:\n\n\"On the mining fields, she finds something much more valuable \u2014 true love.\"\n\nWhen it opened, the film was well received by audiences.\n\nBut Lovely's dream of putting Tasmania in the world film scene was crushed after the movie ran dramatically over budget.\n\n\"They had a budget of 8,000 pounds, and they only got 5,000 pounds back,\" Mr Haygarth said.\n\nToday, that would be a return of $500,000 from a $800,000 investment.\n\n\"That pretty much scuppered the deal. There were plans to make two more films, but it was pretty much the end of this idea of making Tasmania a second Hollywood.\"\n\nIt proved to be Lovely's final role.\n\nShe lived the last 32 years of her life in Tasmania, and some may remember her as the the lady who ran, with her husband, the lolly shop beside the Prince of Wales Theatre on Macquarie Street in Hobart.\n\nLouise Lovely lived the last 32 years of her life in Tasmania. (Supplied: National Film and Sound Archive)\n\nDortmans said following The Unconformity festival she would search for a permanent home for the artefacts she has amassed for the artwork.\n\nWhat remains of the film screens regularly at Queenstown's Gaiety Theatre.\n\n\"I dived deeply into silent film,\" Dortmans said.\n\n\"There's a confronting statistic that 90 per cent of all silent films are lost. Jewelled Nights is just one of many films that have been lost.\"",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Sirikit Kitiyakara, the Queen Mother of Thailand who dazzled the world with her beauty and ostentatious fashion choices yet was often a source of political and dynastic instability at home, has died at the age of 93. Consort to Thailand\u2019s longest-reigning king and mother to his controversial successor, Sirikit had a sense of royal style and glamorous panache neither man could match. She charmed world leaders and diplomats, and won gushing headlines internationally, but was not above meddling in her son\u2019s troublesome love life or weighing into Thailand\u2019s often deadly political conflicts. Queen Sirikit in Bangkok in 1961. Credit: Paris-Match Marie-Claire Born into royalty on August 12, 1932, in the months after a revolution ended absolute monarchy, her branch of the royal family was savvy and ambitious. Her father was serving as a diplomat in Paris when he arranged for his teenage daughter to meet the future king, Bhumibol Adulyadej. Five years her senior, Bhumibol had been born in the US and raised in Switzerland; he came to the crown in 1946 at a young age after his uncle abdicated, his father died young and his older brother died of a gunshot wound that has never been properly explained. Sirikit met Bhumibol in 1948, while he was recovering from a car crash that left him blind in his right eye. They were first cousins once removed, and married before she turned 18 in time for his elaborate coronation ceremony in 1950.

He arrived at 7pm, kept me standing there, practising curtsy after curtsy. So it was hate at first sight.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first of their children \u2013 actor, pop singer and, briefly, prime ministerial candidate Princess Ubolratana \u2013 was born in 1951. They would have four children in seven years. During this time, Sirikit served as regent for 15 days while her husband followed Thai tradition and entered the monkhood, making her the only woman to have officially served as head of state. The monarchy went from the wilderness at the start of Bhumibol\u2019s reign to a powerful force often spoken of as central to the national identity. Sirikit was important to its success, touring the country at her husband\u2019s side and championing Thai silk on the world stage. Her birthday is observed as mothers\u2019 day in Thailand.

Credit: PA Only one of their children was male and therefore eligible for the throne under the rules of the day. The lack of potential heirs and spares has caused lingering dynastic headaches. That boy, Vajiralongkorn, was doted on and indulged by the women of the palace, including his mother, until he was sent abroad for education: first to boarding school in England, then to the King\u2019s School in Sydney and Duntroon in Canberra. Australia was on the royal family\u2019s radar partly because it was an ally in the Vietnam War, and partly because Sirikit and Bhumibol had a positive impression from their royal tour in 1962 which garnered largely fawning press coverage. \u201cAll eyes were on the golden Queen\u201d, \u201cThat smile of Sirikit\u201d, \u201cRoyal visitor\u2019s dazzling new triumph\u201d were typical headlines in Australian newspapers and magazines, which even mentioned an unscheduled trip to the dentist and the government Rolls-Royce reaching 85 miles an hour (137 km/h) as it whisked the royals along the highway between Toowoomba and Brisbane.

Her jewellery was a five-strand necklace of magnificent pearls, a pearl bracelet and, an evident favourite of hers, pearly and diamond earrings.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA minor political scandal erupted after then secretary of the Labour Council of NSW, James Kenny, accused Sirikit of displaying her wealth in a vulgar manner at a time when millions of Thais lived in poverty. As he was also a member of the state upper house, the remarks led to rowdy scenes in parliament. Queen Sirikit with then-PM Malcolm Fraser at Duntroon in 1975. Credit: Fairfax archives The royal family turned to Australia when they were looking at schools for Vajiralongkorn, who struggled in England. Sirikit told Australia\u2019s ambassador that her son hated his school, and agreed when the plan was hatched to send him to Duntroon. Sirikit arrived for Duntroon\u2019s graduation ceremony in December 1975. Questions linger over how well Vajiralongkorn performed: he was given a commission in the Thai armed forces and a certificate of attendance, and the ceremony was adjusted to avoid embarrassment. Sirikit upstaged her son as she rubbed shoulders with prime minister Malcolm Fraser and governor-general John Kerr. She danced with Vajiralongkorn at the graduation ball, following tradition and also denying any would-be princesses from stealing her thunder; Sirikit is said to have kiboshed a budding romance with the daughter of a diplomat. Queen Sirikit dances with her son Maha Vajiralongkorn after his graduation from the Royal Military College, Duntroon. Credit: Fairfax archives Her hand was heavy in the arrangement of Vajiralongkorn\u2019s first doomed marriage. Sirikit orchestrated the wedding between the crown prince and her niece Soamsawali in early 1977, but the young playboy had little time for his cousin-turned-bride. They had one daughter together, but he soon left home, and within nine months his minor wife, an actress, gave birth to the first of their five children together. Sirikit was livid, and some behind-the-scenes tensions spilled into the public. On a tour of the US in late 1981, she made her warnings plain. \u201cI have to be very frank. My son, the Crown Prince, is a little bit of a Don Juan,\u201d she told The Dallas Times Herald.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading She added, \u201cIf the people of Thailand do not approve of the behaviour of my son, then he would either have to change his behaviour or resign from the royal family.\u201d Vajiralongkorn spent almost two decades striving to give his second family legitimacy. Once-secret correspondence among Australian diplomats from this time describes Vajiralongkorn as a victim of dynastic manoeuvring, and it was largely his mother\u2019s doing as she worked to shore up political capital. Sources close to the palace speaking anonymously for fear of retribution say Sirikit was influential in the dissolution of Vajiralongkorn\u2019s second marriage, which ended with his ex-wife and four sons banished and turned into refugees. Sirikit had a family crisis of her own in the 1980s. An affair with a handsome young soldier, Colonel Narongdej Nanda-Photidej, had become problematic. After he died while in the US in May 1985, she struggled to accept he had a heart attack. In his landmark biography of Bhumibol, journalist Paul Handley wrote of how Sirikit \u201cpursued rumours he was murdered. Her mourning became an embarrassment. For his funeral, which all top officials in the military and government had to attend, she issued a commemorative volume bearing photographs of the two together\u201d. That September, shortly after a coup attempt against Bhumibol\u2019s favourite prime minister was thwarted, Sirikit was admitted to hospital and disappeared from the public eye for the next six months. Handley reports she had a breakdown. Then-crown prince Vajiralongkorn with mother Queen Sirikit for the King\u2019s 82nd birthday in 2009.

Palace propaganda and repressive royal defamation laws hid the division in the palace, but this combined with uncertainty over Vajiralongkorn\u2019s fitness to one day take the throne contributed to long periods of political tension that at times turned violent and deadly.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "The NRL\u2019s current TV deal, brokered with Nine (the owner of this masthead) and Foxtel in December 2021, is worth $1.8 billion over five years. Plans are in their infancy, but one model would see the round kick off in the south of France on a Saturday night, which would be aired in Sydney from 6am. That would be followed by games out of Miami (9am), Hawaii (11am) and then the Las Vegas double-header (1pm and 3pm). At the conclusion of the Las Vegas matches, the coverage would potentially move to Asia, with games out of Hong Kong or Singapore (5pm) and Dubai (7.30pm) before the round concludes with a double-header in London from 10pm. That schedule would allow fans to travel to the south of France in the lead-up to the Saturday night matches before travelling to London for fixtures the following day.\n\nIn March, this masthead reported the NRL had its sights on Wembley Stadium as a potential alternative to Las Vegas when the current five-year deal expires. However, the NRL wouldn\u2019t have to wait until 2029 to venture into England under the new plans, with a season-opening fixture in the English capital proposed as part of a round that would also include the Las Vegas matches in 2027. It\u2019s part of a broader ambition of playing all nine NRL opening round fixtures in at least three different continents. The NRL hasn\u2019t yet determined whether the concept would be best delivered in a 24-hour block or spread over a weekend. If the NRL proceeds with its plan, Global Round would further overshadow the start of the AFL season, which has struggled to match the interest in the NRL\u2019s Las Vegas season-opener in the past two years.\n\nUnited States The US options under consideration include Miami, Nashville and different venues in California. The NRL has previously explored the possibility of playing a game in Los Angeles, but it is a huge financial undertaking. The NRL is also looking to capitalise on the large Polynesian population in Hawaii, which is also a major tourist destination for Australian travellers looking to watch their team.\n\nSan Diego, where South Sydney based themselves in the lead up to their 2024 season opener in Las Vegas, provides another option. The NRL is keen to stage a game on the eastern seaboard, which is why Miami and Nashville are being considered. Asia and the Middle East V\u2019landys is keen to explore Asia and the Middle East and has pinpointed Hong Kong as priority target. The Racing NSW CEO knows the region well given the racing industry\u2019s strong ties to Hong Kong. He is also keen to explore possibilities in Dubai and Singapore.\n\nEurope The NRL wants to play the match at Wembley, but other options in London include the impressive Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Emirates Stadium, the home of Arsenal FC, where England hosted Samoa at the 2022 World Cup. Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui and Harry Grant at Wembley Stadium ahead of this weekend\u2019s Ashes series opener. Credit: Grant Trouville The NRL could also work with Super League clubs to host three or four games on the day, or over the same weekend to maximise tourism.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size History and television have long had a love-hate relationship. Historians might be a bit sniffy about television\u2019s inevitable simplifications and insatiable demand for colour and movement, but for decades now, television has been the place where most of us have learnt about the past. In 2025, as we grapple with global political turbulence, the aftermath of a pandemic, and a failed referendum, it\u2019s unsurprising that we are again turning to large-scale television histories to reflect on our past, our identity, and our shared future. SBS\u2019s The Idea of Australia, presented by Rachel Griffiths, and Sky News\u2019 Australia: A History, hosted by Tony Abbott, are simultaneously exploring Australian history for the contemporary moment. While the two series are very different, they have some surprising things in common. Together, they offer a fascinating snapshot of what historian Mark McKenna called Australia\u2019s \u201chistory anxiety\u201d: the long national conversation about how we feel (or should feel) about our national past. When we talk about \u201chistory\u201d, we\u2019re usually talking about one of two things. We typically use the word \u201chistory\u201d to mean an account of the past. But history is also an academic discipline, and a contestable process of research. Historians write histories after deep immersion in evidence, and in conversation with others in their field. Just as breakthrough scientific discoveries are based on incremental progression by dozens of researchers over time, so too, histories emerge through discoveries (based on new archives or new readings of existing ones) that accumulate and settle\n\ninto new accounts of the past. Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of Australia. Credit: Tim Keith It\u2019s easier for history documentaries to tell stories from the past; far harder to convey the ways that historians produce new knowledge about the past. Why does this matter? Well, for one thing, taxpayers help to pay for the production of this new knowledge by expert scholars: they deserve to hear about it. But it\u2019s also important because it reminds us that the meanings of our history are not settled. Events happened in the past, but the meanings we make of them \u2013 and the incidents we deem most important \u2013 will always be open to change. The Idea of Australia is based on Julianne Schultz\u2019s book of the same name. It is a restless, roaming account of some of the ideas that underpin our identity: the fair go, nation-building, and the significance of our land and culture (there are four episodes; the first three were available for review).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTony Abbott\u2019s Australia: A History coincides with the publication of the former prime minister\u2019s own history of Australia. Abbott\u2019s post-political turn to history is fuelled by his desire to persuade Australians to be \u201cmore appreciative of our history, more familiar with it\u201d. His overarching theme is the strength of Australia\u2019s democracy. I mainlined both series over a long Sunday afternoon: six hours in total. That\u2019s a lot of sheep, convicts and founding fathers. Both series spring from a similar concern about Australians\u2019 understanding of their history; each draws links between our past and our present. Australia: A History regards history as an inheritance; The Idea of Australia frames it as a contemporary resource. If you are hoping to understand the politics of Australian history in 2025, watching the two series together is a great place to start. The Idea of Australia starts with a meditation on the \u201cfair go\u201d, a term which originated on the sports field in the 1850s. The fair go is a national myth with deep roots and clear limitations: as filmmaker Rachel Perkins notes, the \u201cfair go\u201d didn\u2019t apply to Indigenous people. The series moves frenetically at times, with too many talking heads, but the more meditative sections, such as a discussion of blackbirding in colonial Queensland, allow the viewer to reflect on the ways that the \u201cfair go\u201d has been unequally distributed across our history. Tony Abbott and former senator Nova Peris in Australia: A History. Credit: Sky News Abbott begins his story of Australia 60,000 years ago, exploring ancient rock art in Arnhem Land. The series recreates the Aboriginal map of Australia, illustrating the hundreds of different language groups that co-existed on this continent, setting up the encounter between the \u201cancient Aboriginal\u201d world and the \u201cmodern British\u201d one of 1788. Abbott and his interviewees argue that the colonisation of Australia was \u201cinevitable\u201d, that the colonial authorities were at pains to avoid violence and that all would be treated equally under the law. Both series spend considerable time examining conflict between First Nations and British settlers. Historian Alex McDermott assures Abbott that this conflict was not a \u201cwar\u201d because it was conducted by settlers, rather than declared by government. This is a clear rebuke to those campaigning to have such conflicts recognised in the Australian War Memorial. Abbott focuses on the Myall Creek massacre of 1838. He declares that it was \u201cone of the worst incidents in Australian history\u201d but says that the treatment of the perpetrators was a \u201ctriumph of justice over racist brutality\u201d. Abbott acknowledges that the frontier was \u201cno doubt brutal and dangerous and violence was rarely punished\u201d, yet by focusing so closely on the rare case where justice was served, Abbott distorts the picture of frontier violence, which, as he reminds us, was still taking place in the 1920s. That Abbott spends so much time discussing frontier conflict is the clearest indication that the ways we understand our national past have changed dramatically in a generation. In the early 2000s there was bitter public debate over the scale of violence on Australia\u2019s colonial frontier. Keith Windschuttle went so far as to allege that this history was a \u201cfabrication\u201d. That debate fuelled a huge amount of scholarly research, most famously the Colonial Frontier Massacre map, led by the late historian Lyndall Ryan, but also new histories of the wars that Aboriginal people fought to defend their country, by Stephen Gapps and others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Idea of Australia recounts new research about the role of the transatlantic slave trade in fuelling violence on Australia\u2019s pastoral frontier. Historian Zoe Laidlaw argues that in the 1830s, the British government paid compensation to former slave owners for the loss of their \u201cproperty\u201d, and much of that money was invested in Australian pastoralism. The drive for land created a \u201cbreathtakingly violent\u201d pastoral frontier, Laidlaw argues. The consequences of this were not only loss of country, the series suggests, but loss of wealth. Frontier conflict, in this view, is not merely a blot on the balance sheet of our history, but it condemned most First Nations peoples to intergenerational poverty. Each series rightly celebrates the continuity and strength of Australian democracy. Australia was not only a leader in expanding voting and political rights but, as historian Marilyn Lake argues in The Idea of Australia, these rights helped shape Australia as an internationally acclaimed \u201csocial laboratory\u201d. The importance of our democracy, especially its longevity and innovativeness, have come into sharper relief over the last decade as democracy worldwide has grown more fragile. It has also renewed the interest of Australian historians in the history of our democracy. Abbott\u2019s triumphalist account of democracy in episode one unfurls like a foregone conclusion towards nationhood. He wants us to celebrate Australian democracy but doesn\u2019t explain its key features, or the struggle that produced it. The expansion of manhood suffrage, women\u2019s political rights, and the denial of full voting rights to First Nations peoples until 1962 are all absent, and only mentioned in passing in episode three. A peaceful Federation was achieved not by strategically fought campaigns but our \u201cdemocratic spirit\u201d. Framing the story this way encourages complacency: there\u2019s no sense that we might need to be vigilant to maintain our democracy. Yet Abbott\u2019s account of the process of federation is more comprehensive than The Idea of Australia. Both series try to wring drama from a subject most school children find dull and which most adults seem to know little about, if Griffith\u2019s vox pops with people in Sydney\u2019s Centennial Park are anything to go by. Ever the ardent Anglophile, Abbott celebrates Federation with a piece to camera in the British House of Lords. Rachel Griffiths narrates it on Oxford Street, part of the route of the 1901 Federation parade, before moving onto the ways the Australian constitution has, at times, hindered political reform. Rachel Griffiths hosts The Idea of Australia on SBS. Notably, each series sees a role for history in contemporary Australia. The Idea of Australia regards history as a source of ideas to apply to current problems. Julianne Schultz, for example, reminds the viewer that the original penal settlements were based on the idea of rehabilitation: something she suggests we might revive to remedy Australia\u2019s shockingly high rates of Indigenous incarceration. In contrast, Abbott worries that Australians have become \u201camnesiacs\u201d. He believes that young people are encouraged to feel \u201cashamed\u201d of their history, and that this is why the study of history is declining. He is right to be concerned about the numbers, at least. Australian history is now part of the national curriculum, and it has been compulsory in NSW schools since 2000, thanks to politicians on both sides of the spectrum who took history seriously. Yet the numbers of students choosing to study history at senior school is flatlining. We have a shortage of history teachers, which means that many students are being taught by teachers without training in the discipline. The number of jobs for historians in universities has declined more than 30 per cent since 1989. And university enrolments in history have dropped by 25 per cent since 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy? Relentless public criticism of history teachers hasn\u2019t helped. An increasingly instrumental view of education has eroded the rationale for studying history, even as the skills history teaches, like analytical thinking, remain in high demand. And there are now serious financial barriers to studying history at university, thanks to the Morrison government\u2019s decision (maintained by Labor) to hike university student fees for history degrees (by 113 per cent) on the grounds that history doesn\u2019t make you \u201cjob-ready\u201d. But what about that question of shame? Abbott interviews three young women about this in episode three, though he puts his thumb on the scales: two of them just happen to work for the Institute of Public Affairs, the libertarian think tank that sponsored the series. He asks them what they remember being taught in school about January 26, 1788. One complains that \u201cpeople walked away feeling guilty\u201d and that they weren\u2019t taught about \u201cthe principles of the rule of law\u201d. Just the thing to quicken the pulse of your average teenager. But beyond Abbott\u2019s three interviewees, research into the views of young people about history suggests a more optimistic picture. Education academics Rebecca Cairns and Kerri Anne Garrard recently published research investigating how school students perceive history and why it matters. They surveyed students who planned to study senior history and those who did not, and found that even those who didn\u2019t study history due to discouragement believed it was relevant. Cairns and Garrard argued that Australian students were unique in their tendency to describe history as a subject that was relevant to their lives. The students they studied understood history as a way to fix contemporary challenges. Cairns and Garrard argue these students approached history with an orientation of \u201ccritical hope\u201d: an orientation that they suggest history can nourish. This is where I think Abbott\u2019s version of the past might not meet his goal of boosting young people\u2019s pride in Australia\u2019s history. Loading Young people are interested in history that speaks to their lives and experiences, and which helps them orient themselves in an unstable world. They want to know why they can\u2019t afford homes in a nation where home ownership is viewed as destiny. In a country where about 30 per cent of Australians were born beyond Australia, they want to know why race continues to be a national fault line. They need to know how and why our democracy developed so many unique and robust features. And in a world where mis- and disinformation will soon become ubiquitous, they will need to know how to evaluate different forms of evidence: a core history skill. Australia: A History and The Idea of Australia demonstrate that the contest over the meaning of our past continues, but also that the debate has changed since the bitter \u201cHistory Wars\u201d of the early 2000s. Best of all, these series turn this contest into public viewing: inviting us all to reflect on our history and why it still matters in 2025. The final two episodes of The Idea of Australia air on October 29 and November 5 at 7.30pm on SBS and on SBS On Demand.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "Outside the cafes of bustling Australian cities, queues form early in the morning as customers wait for their daily fix of matcha.\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal demand for the carefully produced powdered green tea synonymous with Japan has surged in recent years, fuelled by millennials and gen Z consumers seeking healthier drink options.\n\n\n\n\n\nHip cafes around the world now feature matcha lattes, smoothies, and desserts as staples. In Australia, the matcha market generated more than $54 million in revenue in 2024, according to market research firm Grand View Research.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat figure is expected to grow at 7.1 per cent annually over the next five years. By 2030, revenue is projected to exceed $81 million \u2014 a $27 million increase.\n\n\n\nBut that rise in popularity is being met with challenges. Extreme heat and labour shortages in Japan have hit tea plantations hard, leading to a decline in matcha production and surging prices.\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan's green tea exports to Australia reached 195,319 kg between January and August 2025, according to the Japanese Tea Export Promotion Council.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's a 131 per cent year-on-year increase, making Australia the eighth-largest export destination.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply has not kept up. The price of tencha, the raw leaf used for matcha, hit a record 8,235 yen/kg ($82/kg) at a May auction in Kyoto, up 170 per cent from a year earlier, according to the Global Japanese Tea Association.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Prices for matcha green tea set to jump by 70 per cent this year SBS News 00:54 English\n\nThose challenges have led some cafes in Australia to consider turning to another country to meet their matcha needs: China.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne cafe in Melbourne added Chinese matcha lattes to its menu alongside the traditional Japanese version when the shop opened in April.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Chinese matcha has a stronger, more bitter tea base, which makes it great for iced drinks or pairing with plant-based milk,\" the shop posted on social media in July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Japanese matcha, on the other hand, is sweeter and more delicate, ideal for hot drinks or pairing with dairy milk.\"\n\n\n\nMatcha's popularity is surging around the world, an opportunity for Chinese suppliers amid price hikes in the Japanese industry. Source: SBS News / Nicole Gong The cafe said it was the first in the city to offer the alternative \u2014 but it's unlikely to be the last.\n\n\n\n\n\nUmesh Kumar, who runs a cafe in Melbourne's South Yarra, is also considering a shift to serving Chinese matcha.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of suppliers from China have approached me. I got 48 samples last month from China from different regions,\" the 29-year-old told SBS Chinese.\n\n\n\n\n\nKumar said the price of premium \"tier-one\" Japanese matcha has jumped from $390/kg to $500/kg in the past 12 months.\n\n\n\nMelbourne matcha cafe owner Umesh Kumar said his profit margins are shrinking as Japanese matcha prices soar. Source: SBS News / Nicole Gong His cafe uses about 120kg a month. While he's kept prices stable, his profit margins are shrinking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the [Japanese matcha] pricing is going more than $600/kg, that means one cup's cost will be $5.80. It's not worth it to run at $9,\" he said. \"If nothing changes, Australians could be paying over $12 a cup soon.\"\n\n\n\nChina's matcha comeback\n\nZihan He, a social media influencer and Chinese tea culture insider, said the shortage of Japanese matcha offers \"a perfect alignment of timing, opportunity, and momentum\" for Chinese matcha to go global.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There's a gap in the low-end tea market because of Japan's supply shortage,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In 2023, China might not have been ready, but 2025 is different \u2014 many factories now receive strong subsidies to expand their matcha production lines.\"\n\n\n\nZihan He travels to different tea regions in China and globally to promote Chinese tea. Credit: Supplied While Japan's matcha enjoys international prestige, He pointed out that matcha actually originated in China.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt flourished during the Tang and Song dynasties through the diancha (whisked tea) tradition and was known as \"mocha\" before fading in popularity after the Ming dynasty, as tea-drinking customs changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Zen Buddhism spread to Japan, matcha-making techniques went with it, eventually developing into Japan\u2019s renowned tea ceremony culture.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, matcha is experiencing a revival in China, with major production hubs in the Zhejiang and Guizhou provinces.\n\n\n\nWhat are the key differences between Chinese and Japanese matcha?\n\nHe acknowledged that a quality gap remains. Japanese matcha has a bright, vivid green colour and a smooth, sweet taste, while Chinese matcha still tends to be darker and more bitter, she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne key difference, she added, lies in shading \u2014 a vital process that boosts chlorophyll and amino acids, creating that signature green hue and mild flavour. Shading involves artificially reducing the amount of sun the tea bush is exposed to, usually via a canopy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Japan has centuries of experience and detailed data on how long shading should last in each region,\" she said. \"In China, we\u2019re still experimenting \u2014 for example, if farmers follow Japan\u2019s 20-day shading, it might make the tea too astringent at higher altitudes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, He remains optimistic: \"China may be slow from zero to one, but once it learns, it moves fast from one to one hundred.\"\n\n\n\nChange is brewing, but there's a sticking point\n\nFor cafe owners like Kumar, Chinese matcha's biggest appeal is price and scalability.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said tier-three Chinese matcha sells for around $80/kg, compared with $299/kg for Japanese matcha of a similar grade \u2014 nearly four times the price.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, taste remains a sticking point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Japanese matcha is thicker and creamier \u2026 on the other side, Chinese matcha still tastes grainy and bitter at this stage,\" Kumar said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe hasn't switched suppliers yet but is keeping an open mind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Chinese matcha will play a bigger role [in Australia] if they come with the good quality and pricing,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm telling you, businesses are ready to switch.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nTiffany Leon is a dietitian from Maryland in the United States - and also the mum of two boys.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they were little, she followed a new guideline - first issued in the US in 2015 - to introduce peanuts to them at an early age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a dietitian, I practice evidence-based recommendations throughout my career, and so when someone told me, 'Oh this is this is how it's done now, these are the new guidelines', I just thought, 'Oh okay, well this is what we're gonna do then'... So around four, around five months we like sat him in the chair and fed him a few of the lower risk allergenic foods. I think we did like green beans, infant cereal, you know, did a few things first. And then we just jumped in with two feet.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reason for this change in the Leon family is because up to that point, parents had been told to avoid exposing their children to potentially risky foods until they were three years old, in the hope of avoiding a full blown allergy.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeanut allergy is one of the most common of these conditions, caused when the body\u2019s immune system mistakenly identifies proteins in peanuts as harmful and releases chemicals that trigger symptoms like hives, respiratory issues, and sometimes, life-threatening anaphylaxis.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn that event, as this parent told SBS in August, it can become an all-consuming situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAllergies aren't just an inconvenience. They really do shape every aspect of families' lives.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNew guidance aimed at avoiding this kind of outcome came out in a number of countries after Gideon Lack at King\u2019s College London published the groundbreaking Learning Early About Peanut Allergy, or LEAP, trial, work that suggested earlier exposure might actually help children.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo says Dr David Hill, from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe LEAP study... showed that if we actually introduce that allergen to children by mouth, having them eat it, before they're introduced to it via their skin, we can reduce the risk that that child's going to go on to develop the food allergy itself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia's children appear to have avoided developing a peanut allergy - and now Dr Hill has published a new study after analysing electronic health records from dozens of paediatric practices to track diagnoses of food allergies in young children before, during and after the new guidelines were issued.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's found thousands of other children in the US have also avoided developing peanut allergies after their parents followed the same dietary advice as the Leons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat our data shows is that because of, or at least associated with those early introduction guidelines, there's about 60,000 less kids with food allergy today than there would have been. And that's a remarkable thing, right? That's the size of some cities.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Professor Rachel Peters is the Population Health Research Program Lead at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute's National Allergy Centre of Excellence.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's been part of research at the Institute that's also exploring these issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the charity group Allergy and Anaphlyaxis Australia, peanut allergy is one of the most common food allergies in childhood in Australia, affecting 3 percent of infants up to the age of 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Peters says at least two major studies have been completed in Australia in the last decade to explore what might prevent such allergies in the first place - one study happening before Australia adopted new infant feeding guidelines in 2016, and one after that date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe had two population-based studies recruited in the same region, which was Melbourne, Australia... So we had two cohorts recruited with exactly the same methods, but 10 years apart... Firstly, we measured what parents were doing in terms of infant feeding practices and we had some very promising results showing that nearly 90 percent of babies today are being fed peanut in the first year of life, and this is what the guidelines currently recommend... (and secondly) we certainly showed a modest reduction in food allergy, but perhaps not as much as we were expecting.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Peters says the Australian findings suggest much more study needs to be done to establish the various causes of food allergies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cEven though we are certainly starting to see a reduction in the rates of peanut allergy in Australia, they are still quite higher - and higher than in some other countries around the world, and higher than what was shown in this American study as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Associate Professor says some of that research has offered some promising evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cFor example, there is a large trial underway examining whether Vitamin D supplementation in the first year of life is helpful for preventing food allergy... There's a number of studies that show in babies who live further from the equator - so they're geting less exposure to Vitamin D and less sunlight - that they're more likely to develop a food allergy. We even see that within Australia. We have higher rates of food allergy in Melbourne compared to what we see in Queensland.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in the United States, Dr Hill has been encouraged by his findings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt's amazing for me to be able to sit here with you today and say, you know, for the first time in modern history, not only have we reduced the rate of food allergy diagnoses, but we're actually lower than we were five years ago.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, Dr Peters says parents can put their minds at ease.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nUluru and Kata Tjuta are some of central Australia's most iconic landscapes, included in the UNESCO World Heritage List, and for the longest time, have been sacred sites of the Anangu people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey had been known by other names for decades, after European explorers renamed Kata Tjuta as Mount Olga, and Uluru as Ayers Rock, after South Australia\u2019s Chief Secretary, Sir Henry Ayers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1985, the traditional owners of Uluru found themselves at the centre of an historic moment, announced by then Governor General Sir Ninian Stephen:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I now place in the hands of the Uluru Kata Tjuta Aboriginal Land Trust, the title deeds.\"]]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe handback was a landmark moment for Aboriginal land rights in Australia and a powerful recognition of the enduring connection between First Nations peoples and Country.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was the result of years of lobbying by the Central Land Council and Pitjantjatjara Council to recognise the rights of traditional owners, something the Northern Territory government had consistently resisted.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1985, Chief Minister Ian Tuxsworth argued that the territory government should have control, and that the Commissioner of the Territory's Land Court should decide on ownership, even though Uluru had been excluded from the Territory's Aboriginal Land Rights Act when it was declared the Uluru\u2013Kata Tjuta National Park in 1977.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThat Commissioner has already determined that Uluru is not available for claim, and he's also not made any determination that there ARE traditional owners to the Uluru area. Now until those things are settled we are saying that the Aboriginal Land Rights Act has been subverted and changed for political convenience.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Territory government had accordingly lobbied for the title to be transferred to them - which the National Museum of Australia says would have resulted in a reduced title for the Anangu and no control in park management.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hawke government and Governor General believed otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n\nSir Stephen said that would be rectified by the handback - and an agreement for the traditional owners to lease the park back to the government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe trust by the deed which is to be handed over today acquires inalieable Australian law to this place, which is so special to its members... And at the same time, recognising the special significance of Uluru to all Australians, and the appropriateness of it remaining as an Australian national park, the Trust will today lease it back to the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service as a national park.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the anniversary of that historic handback has been remembered 40 years on, with a public event at Talingu\u1e5fu Nyakunytjaku, the Ulu\u1e5fu sunrise viewing area, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the first commemorations took place weeks earlier, in early October, at London's Australia House.\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Commissioner to the UK Stephen Smith says the official event included nine traditional owners, dignitaries, and King Charles - who visited the site in 1983 during his tour of Australia with then wife Princess Diana.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe appears to have never forgotten his experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI remember when I went. At the different times of day it was extraordinary. The light. I didn't have time to get my paintbrush out.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHarry Wilson was among the Anangu representatives who made the trip to the UK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAs you can see a picture of Uluru on the screen here, it brings us into tears, sadness and happiness as well.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Smith says the event itself was a significant one - not just because it's the first time in seven years that King Charles has visited Australia House.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cNormally the palace looks at 50 or 100 year anniversaries, so the fact that we're doing this on the 40th anniversary tells you this was something special.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Albanese offered some remarks to the official service at Australia House via a video message.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a milestone in Aboriginal land rights in Australia, and a powerful moment in the story of our continent. Around the world, Uluru is instantly recognised as Australia. In Australia, it stands as a monument to a peoples' love for country and their determination to see justice done.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian High Commissioner also spoke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Anangu have lived in the area around Uluru-Kata Tjuta for more than 30,000 years. These places are among the most recognised and significant living cultural landscapes, where knowledge, language, song and ceremony have been passed down across countless generations.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nJust like 40 years ago, when traditional songs and dances were performed as the handback took place, the anniversary has also included performances, this time by the nine Anangu Traditional Owners - some of whom had never visited the United Kingdom before.\n\n\n\n\n\nSammy Wilson says the song is from their grandmothers and grandfathers - and talks about the significance of the rock.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Germs could be outpacing modern medicine amid \"epidemic levels\" of prescribing in Australia, according to new research from the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study released last week shows some of the most harmful pathogens are growing stronger, which experts say may be causing a \"vicious cycle\" and putting vulnerable groups in harm's way.\n\n\n\n\n\nOf particular concern is a group of pathogens typically treated with common antimicrobial medications, which are now showing signs of treatment resistance.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts say it means current rates of prescribing could be making things worse.\n\n\n\nWhat are antimicrobials, and which ones are being overprescribed?\n\nAntimicrobials refer to drugs such as antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiparasitics, which target and kill germs \u2014 or pathogens. These are microorganisms that cause disease and include bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.\n\n\n\n\n\nFederal health data shows that 50 per cent of Australian hospital patients will receive an antimicrobial, such as broad-spectrum antibiotics, to treat common infections, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes gonorrhoea, and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA), which causes a range of skin infections as well as serious infections like pneumonia and sepsis.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the WHO's research shows that across the world, such germs are becoming more resilient. In some regions, a third of infections are now resistant to medication.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Data collected by the WHO between 2018 and 2023 shows antibiotic resistance increased between 5 and 15 per cent per annum.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to its latest survey, one in six laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections causing common infections in people worldwide were found to be resistant to antibiotic treatments in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Karin Thursky, director of the National Centre for Antimicrobial Stewardship, tells SBS News that while some restricted antimicrobials are prescribed appropriately in Australia, other kinds are being prescribed poorly.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says Keflex \u2014 the brand name for cephalexin \u2014 is one of the most prescribed medications in Australia, dispensed for a range of infections including ear, skin, respiratory and urinary tract infections.\n\n\n\nIt's given at absolutely epidemic levels.\n\n\"At least one in three prescriptions is inappropriate, often because they're not even needed to be used, particularly for upper respiratory tract or virus infections, or they're not the right choice,\" Thursky says.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther common antimicrobials, like amoxicillin, are also \"exceedingly common\" in aged care and hospital settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those can actually be poorly prescribed, which can lead to poor patient outcomes if they're not necessary.\"\n\n\n\nChallenges in some areas\n\nThursky explains that in an ideal world, doctors would target germs as directly as possible, with antimicrobials that impact a \"narrower spectrum\", as opposed to far-reaching broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There often is a temptation for doctors to reach for a really strong antibiotic when a much narrower spectrum one is okay,\" she says, adding that it's usually recommended that doctors review microbiology results to see if they can reduce treatment to a narrower spectrum antimicrobial.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this requires specialist expertise and equipment, both of which can be hard to access in regional and remote parts of Australia.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Antibiotic resistance is a major health threat. A new study says air pollution is making it worse\n\n\"You often don't have microbiology on site, you won't have stewardship teams [or] even have an on-site pharmacist,\" Thursky says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They're relying on relationships with other hospitals to provide those services.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPrescribing the wrong type or quantity of antimicrobial can have devastating health outcomes for patients \u2014 including prolonged sickness or, in some cases, even death.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can also contribute to a major global health risk: antimicrobial resistance or AMR.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a catch-22 that Dr Trent Yarwood tells SBS News is an \"inevitable\" evolution in the ongoing battle between medical innovation and ever-changing pathogens.\n\n\n\nHow do germs become more resistant?\n\nEssentially, AMR occurs when germs are treated with medication and respond through genetic adaptation and multiplication. Over time, this makes them more resistant to treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Resistance is something that happens inevitably,\" says Yarwood, an infectious diseases physician with the Australasian Society for Infectious Diseases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You expose the germs to some antibiotics and just by random chance there'll be one or two that are a bit resistant to that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Because you've killed off all the ones that are not resistant, then those couple that are left over are able \u2014 if you don't treat the infection completely \u2014 [to] multiply and take its place.\"\n\n\n\nYarwood says that while antibiotics are \"incredibly important\" for patients undergoing chemotherapy, intensive care and joint replacements, their use can create a \"vicious cycle\".\n\n\n\nThe more antibiotic you use, the more likely you're to see resistant germs, which then means you need to use more antibiotics.\n\nThis can create problems for wealthy nations, including Australia, with ready access to antimicrobials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The concern for us in Australia is that we do actually have quite high rates of antibiotic use compared to other similar countries. So it's certainly something that we need to watch out for in the future,\" Yarwood says.\n\n\n\nWhich pathogens are on the rise?\n\nThe WHO survey tracked eight common bacterial pathogens with data from over 100 countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt found that regions with poorer health care had higher rates of AMR, with one in three infections from Southeast Asia being resistant to treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Africa, the rate of AMR was closer to one in five infections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This means that simple infections, which used to be able to be treated with tablets, now need time in hospital and in some cases have no effective treatment at all,\" Yarwood says.\n\n\n\n\n\nGonorrhoea is one of the infections that is becoming harder to manage with oral prescriptions, with treatment now often given by injection or in combination with oral tablets.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News The WHO survey found that three-quarters of urogenital infections of gonorrhoea were resistant to ciprofloxacin \u2014 a broad-spectrum antibiotic \u2014 and resistance is growing in the more recently developed medicine ceftriaxone.\n\n\n\n\n\nShigella, a pathogen that causes diarrhoea, is also becoming more resistant to oral medicines.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Around 30 per cent of gastrointestinal infections caused by Shigella showed resistance to treatment, increasing the risk of treatment failure.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome bacteria that can infect the bloodstream are also on the rise around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the past five years, there has been a 9 per cent annual increase in the number of bloodstream infections stemming from Salmonella, a leading cause of foodborne infection.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 18 per cent of these infections are resistant to treatment, with immunocompromised people and those living with HIV identified as the groups most at risk.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News For hospital patients and those living in aged care, the threat of MRSA is also becoming a pressing issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bug, which is a kind of staph bacteria, can cause sepsis and is often associated with hospitals, as infection can occur during invasive surgical procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe survey found that 27 per cent of MRSA infections in the bloodstream were resistant to treatment.\n\n\n\nA 'significant risk' to children\n\nAs resistance rises among pathogens, it not only poses a greater risk to immunocompromised people and the elderly, it also heightens the risk for children. Yarwood explains this is due to a rise in the proportion of bacteria in children with an infection becoming resistant to first-line antibiotics.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnita Williams, a research officer in infectious disease epidemiology at The Kids Research Institute Australia, says the WHO survey findings are \"alarming\".\n\n\n\nHowever, she notes Australian children were found to be less vulnerable compared to those from other regions, including Africa and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Globally, 45 per cent of E. coli [bacteria] were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (a class of broad-spectrum antibiotics). In Australian children, it was only 21.5 per cent,\" Williams says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For MRSA, globally it was 27.1 per cent, whilst in Australian children it was 13.6 per cent.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams says over the past decade, resistance to first-line antibiotics such as co-trimoxazole (used for a range of bacterial infections) and Augmentin (a type of penicillin) have increased in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Since 2013, enterobacterials such as E. coli resistant to co-trimoxazole have increased from 16.9 per cent to 24.8 per cent, and resistance to Augmentin has increased from 4.2 per cent to 12.8 per cent,\" she says, referring to the WHO's findings.\n\n\n\nThese antibiotics are common first-line treatment for urinary tract infections in children.\n\nAlthough lower than reported globally, these numbers \"represent a significant risk to paediatric healthcare in Australia\", Williams says.\n\n\n\nHow do we fight antimicrobial resistance?\n\nAccording to Yarwood, the best ways to fight AMR are to prevent infections in the first place and to have good-quality prescribing.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut he says a key challenge in outpacing ever-evolving germs is the lack of new drug development, as pharmaceutical companies aren't financially incentivised to research new antibiotics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You might put someone on a week's course of this new antibiotic and then that's it. So the drug companies aren't selling a lot of product,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Whereas if they find a blood pressure medication or a cholesterol medication or something for some sort of chronic disease, then once you start on that, you're probably going to be on that for five or 10 years.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says this creates a financial disincentive to invest in new antimicrobials, leaving governments to take on more of the responsibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The government could create an incentive payment program to help the drug companies actually overcome these financial barriers for doing new antibiotic research,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThursky says antimicrobial stewardship also plays a \"vital role\" in reducing the risk of AMR.\n\n\n\nIt involves ensuring the right drug is selected at the right dose, for the right duration, and only when needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Australia has been leading in stewardship programs for a very long time,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have things like antimicrobial stewardship teams, which are typically made up variably by trained pharmacists, infectious disease physicians, microbiologists, and they review any microbial use in hospitals.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThursky would like to see more health practitioners, including nurses and pharmacists, able to prescribe antibiotics to ensure everyone, regardless of background, can receive the best care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have major problems with the workforce in Australia, equity of access, rural, regional, remote and communities where there are often non-medical prescribers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"So there's definitely a role to accredit nurses and pharmacists, and the main safeguard is that they'll be overseen by clinicians and stewards to make sure that we can monitor the appropriateness of their prescribing.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The average superannuation balance for Australians has passed $172,000 for the first time, but some people's retirement savings are increasing at a \"glacial pace\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a report released on Friday, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA) predicted \"substantially better retirement incomes\" in the years ahead.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the report is new, the data is at June 2023 when the average super balance was $172,834, according to ASFA's analysis of Australian Taxation Office data. By that point, the superannuation guarantee had increased from 10 per cent to 10.50 per cent and has since grown to 12 per cent.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough there are no further scheduled increases, ASFA CEO Mary Delahunty told SBS News that \"strong\" investment returns and a \"maturing\" superannuation system will continue to lead to stronger balances.\n\n\n\nHow does your super balance compare?\n\nDelahunty said that there have been \"volatile times\" in recent years, but that superannuation is a long-term investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's built to weather short-term storms, so markets will go up and down,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But think about your investment over the 30 years, superannuation funds have delivered average returns of about 7.5 per cent year on year, even accounting for the Global Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 crashes.\"\n\n\n\nThe data is at June 2023. Source: SBS News The average superannuation for an Australian nearing typical retirement age, from age 60 to 64, is $355,451.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis average increases with age, with those aged over 75 averaging $492,198.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelahunty said these are strong balances, but looking at the median, or midpoint, value can give a more accurate description of how most Australians are faring.\n\n\n\nFor someone aged between 30 and 34 years old, the median superannuation balance is $38,525.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople aged between 50 and 54 years old have a median balance of $147,857.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd someone aged between 70 and 74 years old has a median balance of $215,009 in their superannuation account.\n\n\n\nHow are people funding their retirement?\n\nSuperannuation is increasingly becoming the main source of income for retirees, according to the ASFA report.\n\n\n\n\n\nFewer people relying on the age pension is a \"historic shift\", Delahunty said, and is a result of workers contributing funds for over three decades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A 30-year-old today with $30,000 in super and earning a median wage, they will retire with $610,000. That's above the $595,000 needed for a comfortable retirement [assuming home ownership],\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It really is an incredible effort.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe result is that the super system has generated around $1 trillion in additional household savings that Australians wouldn't otherwise have, Delahunty added.\n\n\n\nWhere are the gaps?\n\nThe increase in the average superannuation is \"good news\", but gaps remain.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the key factors driving disparity is a person's gender.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt ages 60 to 64, men average about $396,000 in superannuation savings while women average around $313,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the gap between the balances of men and women is shrinking\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen now hold 43.6 per cent of the total superannuation assets, up from 41.9 per cent five years ago.\n\n\n\nDelahunty described this as \"heading in the right direction, albeit at a glacial pace\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The main culprits are career breaks for caring responsibilities, and then women tending to work part-time and then women being paid less,\" Delahunty said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's a wicked problem.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are also differences in superannuation balances when you look at geographical factors.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelahunty said this is due to superannuation \"reflecting\" your working life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Mining towns like Newcastle have average balances of around $199,000 because mining pays well,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Coastal towns like [South Australia's] Victor Harbor also have higher balances, but for different reasons; they're the retirement destinations full of people who've accumulated super over early careers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Meanwhile, younger towns like Darwin tend to have lower balances as workers haven\u2019t had as much time to build up their savings.\"\n\n\n\nProposed changes to superannuation in the works\n\nDelahunty said that changes to superannuation are looking to offset gendered disparity in savings, with superannuation on paid parental leave on the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor has also recently announced financial policy reform in relation to superannuation changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe changes include the removal of tax on unrealised capital gains, which Treasurer Jim Chalmers said \"was a genuine sticking point\" for critics, hoping its removal will mean \"no excuses but to support\" the changes.\n\n\n\nAustralians on lower incomes will also see a change to their super tax offset, which will increase from $500 to $810 as the government expands the eligibility criteria from a $37,000 cut-off to $45,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are worried about your superannuation balance, Delahunty said the best thing to do is engage with it early on.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnsuring you have one account can reduce the fees you are required to pay, and contributing extra money each week can also make a difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Don't wait until you're 50,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For many people, even $20 a week in their twenties can mean tens of thousands extra retirement thanks to compound returns.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is general information.

That's why we completely rely on the tekeyah (Arabic word for charity kitchens), so we wait for it until it comes. We sit and wait for the cooks from when they are getting their equipment ready until they get the food ready and it is distributed. We wait for them. And if they don't come, we can't afford the extremely high prices.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile aid to the besieged enclave is slowly increasing, the World Health Organisation says thousands of trucks loaded with desperately-needed supplies still sit idly beyond Gaza's southern border with Egypt.\n\n\n\n\n\nWHO Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has demanded Israel reopen the Rafah border crossing and allow more NGOs to operate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If the aid that's entering Gaza is significantly low, it cannot dent the hunger level. And the situation still remains catastrophic, because what's entering is not enough.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the truce holding, the World Food Program is once again able to access its distribution list as Palestinians begin to return to their homes \u2013 or what's left of them.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt has 36 distribution centres already open, including nine in Gaza City, and is aiming to get back to 145.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut with only two operational crossings, the World Food Program's Antoine Renard says his organisation is facing a congestion problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To best reach the population in Gaza, you actually need to have multiple entry points. And this is where, you know, you can do and push as much as you want, but with only two crossings that are open, you are facing clearly congestion.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOpening more crossings, especially into northern Gaza, and easing Israeli restrictions on spare parts needed for repair and equipment for humanitarian assistance, would also ensure that more aid reaches people.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Israel has banned several items it deems as having \"dual-use\" over concerns they could be diverted for military purposes \u2013 a distinction Mr Renard totally rejects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We should not actually continue to discuss 'dual use'. One of the things that the ceasefire could bring is actually that we do a proper reset. Related to what humanitarian can do, related to how we need to serve two million people that are clearly dependent on our assistance.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the United States is considering a proposal for humanitarian aid delivery in Gaza that would replace the controversial US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the GHF.\n\n\n\n\n\nReuters news agency says its reporters have seen a copy of the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nUN figures say at least 859 people have been killed around GHF sites since the beginning of its operations in late May 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe GHF has denied that aid seekers are being targeted.\n\n\n\n\n\nA senior US administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, has told Reuters: \"Multiple approaches are being considered to effectively get aid to the people of Gaza,\" adding that \"nothing is finalised\".\n\n\n\n\n\nPlans to maintain the ceasefire are also being rolled out by the UN, working alongside humanitarian partners to implement a 60-day response plan.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Danny Danon, the Israeli Ambassador to the UN, says peace cannot be achieved in the region \"while terror still remains,\" and with the bodies of 13 hostages not returned.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The world must keep the pressure where it belongs, on Hamas, to return the hostages, to lay down its weapons, and to honour the peace plan it signed.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPalestinian envoy to the United Nations, Majed Bamya is also hesitant to show optimism for peace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If after a century of conflict and dispossession and displacement and wars and occupation and colonisation and blockade and walls, if after the 7th of October, if after genocide in Gaza, we are not yet convinced that it is time for peace, that we owe future generations peace, what will ever convince us?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the occupied West Bank, it's olive-picking season.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe centuries-old practice is a vital part of the Palestinian economy and cultural life, relied upon by between 80,000 and 100,000 families for their income.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it's regularly marred by confrontations between Israeli settlers and Palestinians, especially in areas near illegal settlements \u2013 like the southern village of Saeer.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Sounds of yelling)\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Go out,\" one Israeli soldier shouts in Hebrew, while pushing settlers away as they tried to approach Palestinian farmers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAmid mounting reports of settler violence during this year's picking season, Palestinian farmer Jabril Shlaldeh fears olive-picking is becoming impossible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are daily attacks here, where they cut down our olive trees, and it's all documented. We film them stealing the olives, hitting them, and breaking the trees. It's all documented and photographed, and the wall committee has it, and the Israeli army was present. The army was there when the settlers fled. They also stole our sheep, as the army was there as well.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the occupied West Bank is more broadly under threat.\n\n\n\n\n\nA bill applying Israeli law to the territory has narrowly won preliminary approval from Israel's parliament \u2013 a show of support for annexation plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Sound of applause)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vote is the first of four needed to pass the law \u2013 and one pushed by the Knesset's hard-liners, including ultranationalists National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt passed in a 25-24 vote.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Vice President JD Vance, while in Israel, said the administration would oppose any annexation plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I mean, look, if it was a political stunt, it was a very stupid political stunt. And I personally take some insult to it. The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel. The policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. That will continue to be our policy. And if people want to take symbolic votes, they can do that. But we certainly weren't happy about it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut a political scientist says the result is a sign of a crisis within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is Gayil Talshir from the Hebrew University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It may be the case that this is a warning sign that should Netanyahu pursue normalisation with the Saudis and the second phase of the Gaza agreement, meaning that the Palestinian Authority will become part of the forces that are going to control Gaza the day after, he will have a problem with his own coalition.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Mr Netanyahu's office later said the vote was a \"deliberate political provocation\" that aimed to sow division during Vice President Vance's visit.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael argues the territories it captured in the 1967 Six-Day War are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the United Nations' highest court and most of the international community regard them as occupied.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio, also in Israel, said the Knesset's move towards the annexation of the West Bank could endanger President Trump's plan to end the bloodshed in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut despite the uncertainty and unresolved questions, he's maintaining his administration's position of confidence.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Thousands of Samsung mobile phone users risk being out of pocket to replace devices that can't connect to triple-zero , after the federal government decided not to help.\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting by Telstra found that more than 70 older model Samsung handsets weren't connecting correctly to the emergency number.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe telecommunications giant advised that 11 models will need to be completely replaced. The rest need immediate software updates to fix the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\nAffected customers will be notified by email or text message about what to do next.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey have also been warned of their legal obligations, including that certain models must be replaced within 28 days or they will be blocked from the Telstra network.\n\n\n\nAsked if there would be any government funding for people needing replacement phones, federal Emergency Management Minister Kristy McBain said responsibility lay with the companies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The telcos have contracts with customers and those customers ... pay for a service which includes a triple-zero service for their handsets,\" she told ABC radio on Friday.\n\n\n\n\"It's an issue that the telcos are going to have to address.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMcBain said the government had been told up to 10,000 devices might be affected.\n\n\n\nFree replacements to be offered, but not for everyone\n\nSome of the affected users will get free handsets, but telcos and Samsung have stopped short of offering blanket replacements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"If a replacement is required, we'll provide some options based on our customer's needs,\" a Telstra spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are providing some customers in vulnerable circumstances with access to a free replacement. Other customers will be offered an affordable alternative.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nA Samsung spokeswoman said the company was available to answer questions and will \"provide an offer to customers who require their devices to be replaced\".\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Optus spokesperson urged clients to contact its customer service team and pointed affected users to Samsung for options.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Telstra and Optus warn some older Samsung phones can\u2019t connect to triple-zero SBS News 00:36 English\n\nMcBain also flagged that Optus will be facing fines following the completion of an investigation by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA).\n\n\n\n\n\nGreens communications spokeswoman Sarah Hanson-Young said Optus needed a cultural overhaul and accused it of putting \"profits ahead of safety\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You wouldn't want to see this exodus of executives as just rats jumping ship, and this company has a problem with its safety record,\" she told ABC radio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It has a problem with how it deals with its customers, and it's time that we review its licence.\"\n\n\n\nThe Greens have been pushing for a Senate inquiry to be held before Christmas.\n\n\n\n\n\nHanson-Young is confident the inquiry will get the necessary support when parliament returns next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement on Friday, ACMA said it had rejected a proposed telecommunications industry code, deciding it would not provide appropriate community safeguards.\n\n\n\n\"Australian consumers need to be confident that they will be treated fairly when purchasing services, have protection from irresponsible selling, are provided clear and relevant information on mobile coverage and that they will not be unfairly disconnected,\" acting chair Adam Suckling said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In our view, the draft code would not deliver the level of protection the community should expect.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSuckling said it was disappointing the telcos had not been able to develop a proposal that would \"deliver what their customers deserve\" despite extensive feedback.\n\n\n\n",

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Sirikit Kitiyakara, the Queen Mother of Thailand who dazzled the world with her beauty and ostentatious fashion choices yet was often a source of political and dynastic instability at home, has died at the age of 93. Consort to Thailand\u2019s longest-reigning king and mother to his controversial successor, Sirikit had a sense of royal style and glamorous panache neither man could match. She charmed world leaders and diplomats, and won gushing headlines internationally, but was not above meddling in her son\u2019s troublesome love life or weighing into Thailand\u2019s often deadly political conflicts. Queen Sirikit in Bangkok in 1961. Credit: Paris-Match Marie-Claire Born into royalty on August 12, 1932, in the months after a revolution ended absolute monarchy, her branch of the royal family was savvy and ambitious. Her father was serving as a diplomat in Paris when he arranged for his teenage daughter to meet the future king, Bhumibol Adulyadej. Five years her senior, Bhumibol had been born in the US and raised in Switzerland; he came to the crown in 1946 at a young age after his uncle abdicated, his father died young and his older brother died of a gunshot wound that has never been properly explained. Sirikit met Bhumibol in 1948, while he was recovering from a car crash that left him blind in his right eye. They were first cousins once removed, and married before she turned 18 in time for his elaborate coronation ceremony in 1950.

He arrived at 7pm, kept me standing there, practising curtsy after curtsy. So it was hate at first sight.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first of their children \u2013 actor, pop singer and, briefly, prime ministerial candidate Princess Ubolratana \u2013 was born in 1951. They would have four children in seven years. During this time, Sirikit served as regent for 15 days while her husband followed Thai tradition and entered the monkhood, making her the only woman to have officially served as head of state. The monarchy went from the wilderness at the start of Bhumibol\u2019s reign to a powerful force often spoken of as central to the national identity. Sirikit was important to its success, touring the country at her husband\u2019s side and championing Thai silk on the world stage. Her birthday is observed as mothers\u2019 day in Thailand.

Credit: PA Only one of their children was male and therefore eligible for the throne under the rules of the day. The lack of potential heirs and spares has caused lingering dynastic headaches. That boy, Vajiralongkorn, was doted on and indulged by the women of the palace, including his mother, until he was sent abroad for education: first to boarding school in England, then to the King\u2019s School in Sydney and Duntroon in Canberra. Australia was on the royal family\u2019s radar partly because it was an ally in the Vietnam War, and partly because Sirikit and Bhumibol had a positive impression from their royal tour in 1962 which garnered largely fawning press coverage. \u201cAll eyes were on the golden Queen\u201d, \u201cThat smile of Sirikit\u201d, \u201cRoyal visitor\u2019s dazzling new triumph\u201d were typical headlines in Australian newspapers and magazines, which even mentioned an unscheduled trip to the dentist and the government Rolls-Royce reaching 85 miles an hour (137 km/h) as it whisked the royals along the highway between Toowoomba and Brisbane.

Her jewellery was a five-strand necklace of magnificent pearls, a pearl bracelet and, an evident favourite of hers, pearly and diamond earrings.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA minor political scandal erupted after then secretary of the Labour Council of NSW, James Kenny, accused Sirikit of displaying her wealth in a vulgar manner at a time when millions of Thais lived in poverty. As he was also a member of the state upper house, the remarks led to rowdy scenes in parliament. Queen Sirikit with then-PM Malcolm Fraser at Duntroon in 1975. Credit: Fairfax archives The royal family turned to Australia when they were looking at schools for Vajiralongkorn, who struggled in England. Sirikit told Australia\u2019s ambassador that her son hated his school, and agreed when the plan was hatched to send him to Duntroon. Sirikit arrived for Duntroon\u2019s graduation ceremony in December 1975. Questions linger over how well Vajiralongkorn performed: he was given a commission in the Thai armed forces and a certificate of attendance, and the ceremony was adjusted to avoid embarrassment. Sirikit upstaged her son as she rubbed shoulders with prime minister Malcolm Fraser and governor-general John Kerr. She danced with Vajiralongkorn at the graduation ball, following tradition and also denying any would-be princesses from stealing her thunder; Sirikit is said to have kiboshed a budding romance with the daughter of a diplomat. Queen Sirikit dances with her son Maha Vajiralongkorn after his graduation from the Royal Military College, Duntroon. Credit: Fairfax archives Her hand was heavy in the arrangement of Vajiralongkorn\u2019s first doomed marriage. Sirikit orchestrated the wedding between the crown prince and her niece Soamsawali in early 1977, but the young playboy had little time for his cousin-turned-bride. They had one daughter together, but he soon left home, and within nine months his minor wife, an actress, gave birth to the first of their five children together. Sirikit was livid, and some behind-the-scenes tensions spilled into the public. On a tour of the US in late 1981, she made her warnings plain. \u201cI have to be very frank. My son, the Crown Prince, is a little bit of a Don Juan,\u201d she told The Dallas Times Herald.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLoading She added, \u201cIf the people of Thailand do not approve of the behaviour of my son, then he would either have to change his behaviour or resign from the royal family.\u201d Vajiralongkorn spent almost two decades striving to give his second family legitimacy. Once-secret correspondence among Australian diplomats from this time describes Vajiralongkorn as a victim of dynastic manoeuvring, and it was largely his mother\u2019s doing as she worked to shore up political capital. Sources close to the palace speaking anonymously for fear of retribution say Sirikit was influential in the dissolution of Vajiralongkorn\u2019s second marriage, which ended with his ex-wife and four sons banished and turned into refugees. Sirikit had a family crisis of her own in the 1980s. An affair with a handsome young soldier, Colonel Narongdej Nanda-Photidej, had become problematic. After he died while in the US in May 1985, she struggled to accept he had a heart attack. In his landmark biography of Bhumibol, journalist Paul Handley wrote of how Sirikit \u201cpursued rumours he was murdered. Her mourning became an embarrassment. For his funeral, which all top officials in the military and government had to attend, she issued a commemorative volume bearing photographs of the two together\u201d. That September, shortly after a coup attempt against Bhumibol\u2019s favourite prime minister was thwarted, Sirikit was admitted to hospital and disappeared from the public eye for the next six months. Handley reports she had a breakdown. Then-crown prince Vajiralongkorn with mother Queen Sirikit for the King\u2019s 82nd birthday in 2009. Credit: AP The royal couple lived largely separate lives for decades afterwards, but they would appear together for important events and ceremonies. Palace propaganda and repressive royal defamation laws hid the division in the palace, but this combined with uncertainty over Vajiralongkorn\u2019s fitness to one day take the throne contributed to long periods of political tension that at times turned violent and deadly.\n\nAdvertisement",

        "text": "The NRL\u2019s current TV deal, brokered with Nine (the owner of this masthead) and Foxtel in December 2021, is worth $1.8 billion over five years. Plans are in their infancy, but one model would see the round kick off in the south of France on a Saturday night, which would be aired in Sydney from 6am. That would be followed by games out of Miami (9am), Hawaii (11am) and then the Las Vegas double-header (1pm and 3pm). At the conclusion of the Las Vegas matches, the coverage would potentially move to Asia, with games out of Hong Kong or Singapore (5pm) and Dubai (7.30pm) before the round concludes with a double-header in London from 10pm. That schedule would allow fans to travel to the south of France in the lead-up to the Saturday night matches before travelling to London for fixtures the following day.\n\nIn March, this masthead reported the NRL had its sights on Wembley Stadium as a potential alternative to Las Vegas when the current five-year deal expires. However, the NRL wouldn\u2019t have to wait until 2029 to venture into England under the new plans, with a season-opening fixture in the English capital proposed as part of a round that would also include the Las Vegas matches in 2027. It\u2019s part of a broader ambition of playing all nine NRL opening round fixtures in at least three different continents. The NRL hasn\u2019t yet determined whether the concept would be best delivered in a 24-hour block or spread over a weekend. If the NRL proceeds with its plan, Global Round would further overshadow the start of the AFL season, which has struggled to match the interest in the NRL\u2019s Las Vegas season-opener in the past two years.\n\nUnited States The US options under consideration include Miami, Nashville and different venues in California. The NRL has previously explored the possibility of playing a game in Los Angeles, but it is a huge financial undertaking. The NRL is also looking to capitalise on the large Polynesian population in Hawaii, which is also a major tourist destination for Australian travellers looking to watch their team.\n\nSan Diego, where South Sydney based themselves in the lead up to their 2024 season opener in Las Vegas, provides another option. The NRL is keen to stage a game on the eastern seaboard, which is why Miami and Nashville are being considered. Asia and the Middle East V\u2019landys is keen to explore Asia and the Middle East and has pinpointed Hong Kong as priority target. The Racing NSW CEO knows the region well given the racing industry\u2019s strong ties to Hong Kong. He is also keen to explore possibilities in Dubai and Singapore.\n\nEurope The NRL wants to play the match at Wembley, but other options in London include the impressive Tottenham Hotspur Stadium and Emirates Stadium, the home of Arsenal FC, where England hosted Samoa at the 2022 World Cup. Tino Fa\u2019asuamaleaui and Harry Grant at Wembley Stadium ahead of this weekend\u2019s Ashes series opener. Credit: Grant Trouville The NRL could also work with Super League clubs to host three or four games on the day, or over the same weekend to maximise tourism. One opportunity is to try to include the Darren Lockyer-owned London Broncos into the event. V\u2019landys and Abdo will meet with Lockyer and his business partner, Grant Wechsel, in London this weekend.\n\nLoading The Broncos, who have signed Jason Demetriou as coach and Reagan Campbell-Gillard as a player, missed out on the Super League in 2026 but are hoping to earn promotion into the competition the following year. That could coincide with them playing in Global Round as part of a triple header or even a weekend-long event in London. South of France There is an opportunity to grow the sport in France, which was once considered a strong rugby league-playing nation.",

Together, they offer a fascinating snapshot of what historian Mark McKenna called Australia\u2019s \u201chistory anxiety\u201d: the long national conversation about how we feel (or should feel) about our national past. When we talk about \u201chistory\u201d, we\u2019re usually talking about one of two things. We typically use the word \u201chistory\u201d to mean an account of the past. But history is also an academic discipline, and a contestable process of research. Historians write histories after deep immersion in evidence, and in conversation with others in their field. Just as breakthrough scientific discoveries are based on incremental progression by dozens of researchers over time, so too, histories emerge through discoveries (based on new archives or new readings of existing ones) that accumulate and settle\n\ninto new accounts of the past.

Credit: Tim Keith It\u2019s easier for history documentaries to tell stories from the past; far harder to convey the ways that historians produce new knowledge about the past. Why does this matter? Well, for one thing, taxpayers help to pay for the production of this new knowledge by expert scholars: they deserve to hear about it. But it\u2019s also important because it reminds us that the meanings of our history are not settled. Events happened in the past, but the meanings we make of them \u2013 and the incidents we deem most important \u2013 will always be open to change. The Idea of Australia is based on Julianne Schultz\u2019s book of the same name. It is a restless, roaming account of some of the ideas that underpin our identity: the fair go, nation-building, and the significance of our land and culture (there are four episodes; the first three were available for review).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTony Abbott\u2019s Australia: A History coincides with the publication of the former prime minister\u2019s own history of Australia. Abbott\u2019s post-political turn to history is fuelled by his desire to persuade Australians to be \u201cmore appreciative of our history, more familiar with it\u201d. His overarching theme is the strength of Australia\u2019s democracy. I mainlined both series over a long Sunday afternoon: six hours in total. That\u2019s a lot of sheep, convicts and founding fathers. Both series spring from a similar concern about Australians\u2019 understanding of their history; each draws links between our past and our present. Australia: A History regards history as an inheritance; The Idea of Australia frames it as a contemporary resource. If you are hoping to understand the politics of Australian history in 2025, watching the two series together is a great place to start. The Idea of Australia starts with a meditation on the \u201cfair go\u201d, a term which originated on the sports field in the 1850s. The fair go is a national myth with deep roots and clear limitations: as filmmaker Rachel Perkins notes, the \u201cfair go\u201d didn\u2019t apply to Indigenous people. The series moves frenetically at times, with too many talking heads, but the more meditative sections, such as a discussion of blackbirding in colonial Queensland, allow the viewer to reflect on the ways that the \u201cfair go\u201d has been unequally distributed across our history.

The series recreates the Aboriginal map of Australia, illustrating the hundreds of different language groups that co-existed on this continent, setting up the encounter between the \u201cancient Aboriginal\u201d world and the \u201cmodern British\u201d one of 1788. Abbott and his interviewees argue that the colonisation of Australia was \u201cinevitable\u201d, that the colonial authorities were at pains to avoid violence and that all would be treated equally under the law. Both series spend considerable time examining conflict between First Nations and British settlers. Historian Alex McDermott assures Abbott that this conflict was not a \u201cwar\u201d because it was conducted by settlers, rather than declared by government. This is a clear rebuke to those campaigning to have such conflicts recognised in the Australian War Memorial. Abbott focuses on the Myall Creek massacre of 1838. He declares that it was \u201cone of the worst incidents in Australian history\u201d but says that the treatment of the perpetrators was a \u201ctriumph of justice over racist brutality\u201d. Abbott acknowledges that the frontier was \u201cno doubt brutal and dangerous and violence was rarely punished\u201d, yet by focusing so closely on the rare case where justice was served, Abbott distorts the picture of frontier violence, which, as he reminds us, was still taking place in the 1920s. That Abbott spends so much time discussing frontier conflict is the clearest indication that the ways we understand our national past have changed dramatically in a generation. In the early 2000s there was bitter public debate over the scale of violence on Australia\u2019s colonial frontier. Keith Windschuttle went so far as to allege that this history was a \u201cfabrication\u201d. That debate fuelled a huge amount of scholarly research, most famously the Colonial Frontier Massacre map, led by the late historian Lyndall Ryan, but also new histories of the wars that Aboriginal people fought to defend their country, by Stephen Gapps and others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Idea of Australia recounts new research about the role of the transatlantic slave trade in fuelling violence on Australia\u2019s pastoral frontier. Historian Zoe Laidlaw argues that in the 1830s, the British government paid compensation to former slave owners for the loss of their \u201cproperty\u201d, and much of that money was invested in Australian pastoralism. The drive for land created a \u201cbreathtakingly violent\u201d pastoral frontier, Laidlaw argues. The consequences of this were not only loss of country, the series suggests, but loss of wealth. Frontier conflict, in this view, is not merely a blot on the balance sheet of our history, but it condemned most First Nations peoples to intergenerational poverty. Each series rightly celebrates the continuity and strength of Australian democracy. Australia was not only a leader in expanding voting and political rights but, as historian Marilyn Lake argues in The Idea of Australia, these rights helped shape Australia as an internationally acclaimed \u201csocial laboratory\u201d. The importance of our democracy, especially its longevity and innovativeness, have come into sharper relief over the last decade as democracy worldwide has grown more fragile. It has also renewed the interest of Australian historians in the history of our democracy. Abbott\u2019s triumphalist account of democracy in episode one unfurls like a foregone conclusion towards nationhood. He wants us to celebrate Australian democracy but doesn\u2019t explain its key features, or the struggle that produced it. The expansion of manhood suffrage, women\u2019s political rights, and the denial of full voting rights to First Nations peoples until 1962 are all absent, and only mentioned in passing in episode three. A peaceful Federation was achieved not by strategically fought campaigns but our \u201cdemocratic spirit\u201d. Framing the story this way encourages complacency: there\u2019s no sense that we might need to be vigilant to maintain our democracy. Yet Abbott\u2019s account of the process of federation is more comprehensive than The Idea of Australia. Both series try to wring drama from a subject most school children find dull and which most adults seem to know little about, if Griffith\u2019s vox pops with people in Sydney\u2019s Centennial Park are anything to go by. Ever the ardent Anglophile, Abbott celebrates Federation with a piece to camera in the British House of Lords. Rachel Griffiths narrates it on Oxford Street, part of the route of the 1901 Federation parade, before moving onto the ways the Australian constitution has, at times, hindered political reform. Rachel Griffiths hosts The Idea of Australia on SBS. Notably, each series sees a role for history in contemporary Australia. The Idea of Australia regards history as a source of ideas to apply to current problems. Julianne Schultz, for example, reminds the viewer that the original penal settlements were based on the idea of rehabilitation: something she suggests we might revive to remedy Australia\u2019s shockingly high rates of Indigenous incarceration. In contrast, Abbott worries that Australians have become \u201camnesiacs\u201d. He believes that young people are encouraged to feel \u201cashamed\u201d of their history, and that this is why the study of history is declining. He is right to be concerned about the numbers, at least. Australian history is now part of the national curriculum, and it has been compulsory in NSW schools since 2000, thanks to politicians on both sides of the spectrum who took history seriously. Yet the numbers of students choosing to study history at senior school is flatlining. We have a shortage of history teachers, which means that many students are being taught by teachers without training in the discipline. The number of jobs for historians in universities has declined more than 30 per cent since 1989. And university enrolments in history have dropped by 25 per cent since 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy? Relentless public criticism of history teachers hasn\u2019t helped. An increasingly instrumental view of education has eroded the rationale for studying history, even as the skills history teaches, like analytical thinking, remain in high demand. And there are now serious financial barriers to studying history at university, thanks to the Morrison government\u2019s decision (maintained by Labor) to hike university student fees for history degrees (by 113 per cent) on the grounds that history doesn\u2019t make you \u201cjob-ready\u201d. But what about that question of shame? Abbott interviews three young women about this in episode three, though he puts his thumb on the scales: two of them just happen to work for the Institute of Public Affairs, the libertarian think tank that sponsored the series. He asks them what they remember being taught in school about January 26, 1788. One complains that \u201cpeople walked away feeling guilty\u201d and that they weren\u2019t taught about \u201cthe principles of the rule of law\u201d. Just the thing to quicken the pulse of your average teenager. But beyond Abbott\u2019s three interviewees, research into the views of young people about history suggests a more optimistic picture. Education academics Rebecca Cairns and Kerri Anne Garrard recently published research investigating how school students perceive history and why it matters. They surveyed students who planned to study senior history and those who did not, and found that even those who didn\u2019t study history due to discouragement believed it was relevant. Cairns and Garrard argued that Australian students were unique in their tendency to describe history as a subject that was relevant to their lives. The students they studied understood history as a way to fix contemporary challenges. Cairns and Garrard argue these students approached history with an orientation of \u201ccritical hope\u201d: an orientation that they suggest history can nourish. This is where I think Abbott\u2019s version of the past might not meet his goal of boosting young people\u2019s pride in Australia\u2019s history. Loading Young people are interested in history that speaks to their lives and experiences, and which helps them orient themselves in an unstable world. They want to know why they can\u2019t afford homes in a nation where home ownership is viewed as destiny. In a country where about 30 per cent of Australians were born beyond Australia, they want to know why race continues to be a national fault line. They need to know how and why our democracy developed so many unique and robust features. And in a world where mis- and disinformation will soon become ubiquitous, they will need to know how to evaluate different forms of evidence: a core history skill. Australia: A History and The Idea of Australia demonstrate that the contest over the meaning of our past continues, but also that the debate has changed since the bitter \u201cHistory Wars\u201d of the early 2000s. Best of all, these series turn this contest into public viewing: inviting us all to reflect on our history and why it still matters in 2025. The final two episodes of The Idea of Australia air on October 29 and November 5 at 7.30pm on SBS and on SBS On Demand.\n\nAdvertisement",
