(Supplied)\n\nIt's a stunning reversal for a car company whose rise once seemed unstoppable as it overtook traditional automakers with far more resources and helped make Musk the world's richest man.\n\nThe sales drop came despite President Donald Trump's marketing effort early last year when he called a press conference to praise Musk as a \u201cpatriot\u201d in front of Teslas lined up on the White House driveway, then announced he would be buying one, bucking presidential precedent to not endorse private company products.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Tesla sales totaled 418,227, falling short of even the much reduced 440,000 target that analysts recently polled by FactSet had expected.\n\nSales were hit hard by the expiration of a $11,000 ($US7,500) tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.\n\nTesla vehicles line a parking lot at the company's Fremont, Calif., factory (AP)\n\nTesla stock fell 2.6 per cent to $US438.07 on Friday.\n\nEven with multiple issues buffeting the company, investors are betting that Tesla CEO Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make\n\nTesla a leader in robotaxi services and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices. Reflecting that optimism, the stock finished 2025 with a gain of approximately 11 per cent.\n\nThe latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales.\n\nThe new Model Y costs just under $40,000 ($UA59,000) while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $37,000 ($UA54,000).\n\nThose versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.\n\nFor fourth-quarter earnings coming out in late January, analysts are expecting the company to post a three per cent drop in sales and a nearly 40 per cent drop in earnings per share, according to FactSet.\n\nAnalysts expect the downward trend in sales and profits to eventually reverse itself as 2026 rolls along.\n\nMusk said earlier last year that a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in sales was underway, but investors were unruffled when that didn't pan out, choosing instead to focus on Musk's pivot to different parts of business.\n\nMusk said earlier last year that a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in sales was underway, but investors were unruffled when that didn't pan out, choosing instead to focus on Musk's pivot to different parts of business. (AP)\n\nHe has has been saying the future of the company lies with its driverless robotaxis service, its energy storage business and building robots for the home and factory \u2014 and much less with car sales.\n\nTesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin in June, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company hopes to roll out the service in several cities this year.\n\nTo do that successfully, it needs to take on rival Waymo, which has been operating autonomous taxis for years and has far more customers.\n\nIt also will also have to contend with regulatory challenges.\n\nThe company is under several federal safety investigations and other probes. In California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.\n\n\u201cRegulatory is going to be a big issue,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a well-known bull on the stock. \u201cWe're dealing with people's lives.\u201d\n\nStill, Ives said he expects Tesla's autonomous offerings will soon overcome any setbacks.\n\nMusk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year.\n\nOne big problem with $1600 flip phone released in 1996 View Gallery\n\nREAD MORE: Police carrying heavy weapons set to patrol Sydney Ashes series \ufeff\n\nThe company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.\n\nTo keep Musk focused on the company, Tesla\u2019s directors awarded Musk a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.\n\nMusk scored another huge windfall two weeks ago when the Delaware Supreme Court reversed a decision that deprived him of a $82b ($US55b) pay package that Tesla doled out in 2018.",

(AP)\n\n\u201cI just use unconventional tools,\u201d Martins says, smiling, moments before sliding a razor-sharp shovel edge across Njenga\u2019s head, lopping off a swath of hair in the first of a series of moves that yields a surprisingly clean haircut.\n\nUnconventional tools are a hallmark for Martins, who is one of Kenya\u2019s most recognisable barbers with around one million followers on each of his Instagram and TikTok accounts, where he is known as Chief Safro.\n\nAs he makes precision cuts across Njenga\u2019s head, a helper stands to the side, capturing every moment from different angles on a smartphone camera.\n\nInfluencer barbers are a new trend in Kenya, where social media usage has exploded in recent years and platforms like TikTok are being used both for entertainment and as a lucrative side hustle.\n\nBarber and content creator Safari Martins shaves Ian Njenga in Kiambu, Kenya on Wednesday, November 26. (AP)\n\nBorn in Rwanda and now based in Nairobi, Martins got his start barbering in high school in 2018.\n\nUsing borrowed clippers, he began offering trims outside classrooms and in cramped dormitories.\n\nFive years later, he added a camera and dropped a conventional trimmer and never turned back.\n\nMartins went viral for zany barbering methods, but he has increasingly incorporated traditional African folk tales into voiceovers on his videos.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m motivated by African culture, by African stories,\u201d he says, adding that one of his tools, a sharpened iron box, was blessed by village elders.\n\nThe barber\u2019s staying power has come from the haircuts themselves, which his customers say they love and the chance to be featured on one of Kenya\u2019s most magnetic social media accounts.\n\nBarber and content creator Safari Martins uses a clothing iron as he shaves Ian Njenga in Kiambu, Kenya. (AP)\n\n\u201cIf I compare him with other barbers his talent is next level,\u201d says Njenga, who first visited Martins last year.\n\n\u201cWhen I get shaved here I get very comfortable \u2026 while walking in the streets I get very confident.\u201d\n\nThe draw of a unique barbering experience and five minutes of social media fame is enough for customers to push past the price.\n\nMartins charges up to 1500 Kenyan shillings, or about $17, for one of his cuts, a hefty premium in Nairobi, where men may pay a tenth of that for a trim.\n\nThe popularity of Martins and other content creator barbers has come amid the breakneck growth of social media in Kenya.\n\nIn January 2023, there were just 10.6 million social media users in the country, according to DataReportal, a market research group.\n\nA man uses his phone to record barber and content creator Safari Martins as he shaves Ian Njenga in Kiambu, Kenya. (AP)\n\nBy January 2025, that number had increased almost 50 per cent, to 15.1 million.\n\nWith monetisation of social media content often benchmarked to Western digital advertising rates, finding success online can also bring a relative windfall to Kenyans.\n\nAround 15 per cent of Kenyans engaged in online content creation rely on it as their primary source of income, the Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis, a think tank, said in a June 2025 brief.\n\nNevertheless, Martins complains that barbers do not not reap the same rewards as other content creators, and he is right.\n\nSome of the highest-paid creators are those who make gaming, education, or lifestyle content, according to Fundmates, a company that finances influencers, because of the wide applicability of brand deals in these niches.\n\n\u201cBarbers get viral on social media but I feel like they are not respected,\u201d Martins said.\n\n\u201cYou are not paid as a content creator, even though you have the views, even if you have the engagement.\u201d",

(Louie Douvis/AFR)\n\nWill interest rates rise in 2026?\n\nIt's possible, and some banks think we'll get a hike as soon as February 3.\n\n\"With what we know at the moment, I don't think there are interest rate cuts on the horizon for the foreseeable future,\" RBA Governor Michele Bullock said after the central bank's final rates decision of the year on December 9 .\n\n\"The question is, is it just an extended hold from here, or is it a possibility of a rate rise?\n\n\"They are the two things the board will be looking closely at coming into the new year.\"\n\nThose hawkish comments have led a range of economists to tip a rate hike in 2026.\n\nCommonwealth Bank head of Australian economics Belinda Allen says the first meeting of the year will be a live one, and both CBA and NAB are predicting a 25-basis-point increase on the first meeting of the year.\n\nNAB has forecast even more pain, pencilling in a further cut in May.\n\nThe market is more pessimistic.\n\n\ufeff The market has been pricing in around a 27 per cent chance of a hike in February (that figure has been both slightly higher and lower throughout late December, but was at zero at the start of the month), and an end-year cash rate of about 4 per cent.\n\nNot everyone agrees with that, though.\n\nThe other half of the big four banks, Westpac and ANZ, are predicting a year of holds, as are some economists.\n\n\"We expect to see the cash rate remain at 3.6 per cent in 2026, with the swing back to rate hikes more a story for 2027,\" AMP chief economist Shane Oliver wrote.\n\n\"But we concede that the risks look like they are now a bit more to the upside on rates in 2026.\n\n\"However, our assessment is that the swing in the money market from expecting 2 or 3 more cuts after the August RBA meeting to now expecting nearly two hikes (in 2026) is premature and a bit too extreme.\"\n\nMortgage holders appear to have little hope for a rate cut in the near future. (Joe Armao/The Age)\n\nWhy aren't interest rates expected to come down?\n\nCasual observers \u2013 particularly those with a mortgage \u2013 might be wondering why we're suddenly talking about the prospect of rate hikes, not cuts.\n\nAfter all, it was only a few months ago that economists were talking about the cash rate settling around 3.1 per cent.\n\nThe reason for the turnaround is an unexpected surge in inflation.\n\nHaving fallen back into the central bank's target band of 2-3 per cent, the consumer price index (CPI) jumped to 3.2 per cent in the September quarter and again to 3.8 per cent in October, with underlying inflation not too far behind.\n\n\ufeff The data-driven RBA will get two new batches of inflation figures before its February decision \u2013 for November on January 7 and December on the 28th.\n\nIf inflation cools off, so too will the chance of a rate hike.\n\nBut if it comes in hot once again, then mortgage holders will have every right to feel nervous about the first rates decision of the year.\n\n\"If trimmed mean inflation in the December quarter does not fall back as we expect (and comes in around 0.9 per cent quarter-on-quarter or more), then a hike as early as February is possible,\" Oliver said.\n\n\"December quarter CPI inflation is the key to what happens early next year on rates.\"",

It's not easy, but he's got himself in on a few occasions and probably not gone on with it.\n\n\"That's probably the disappointing part about it \u2014 starting your innings is actually the hardest thing. He's doing that pretty well and just finding a way to get out.\n\n\"He's batted in different spots, which also can't be easy, as well, when you're trying to nail down one sort of role.\"\n\nSpinner Todd Murphy's hopes of a first home Test are also up in the air after he was overlooked for the seaming MCG deck.\n\nMurphy last played on the Test tour of Sri Lanka in early 2025 and was brought into the Ashes squad as cover for injured veteran Nathan Lyon.\n\nAAP",

        "text": "Australian cattle farmers producing wagyu and Angus beef are likely to be among the hardest hit by China's 55 per cent tariff on beef exceeding the 205,000-tonne quota.\n\nChina's global trade restrictions came into effect on January 1 after claims by farmers in that country that beef imports were hurting their profitability.\n\nNSW Hunter Valley Angus producer Robert Mackenzie said the 55 per cent tariff would have a detrimental affect on his industry.\n\n\"There would be no way that you'd be selling any product into China once that tariff comes into play, so it'll be a little bit of a mess,\" he said.\n\nRobert Mackenzie wants suppliers to have fair access to a quota system to supply China over 12 months. (ABC Rural: Amelia Bernasconi)\n\nMr Mackenzie's company, Macka's Australian Black Angus Beef, exports 26 tonnes of produce to China a month.\n\n\"I'm worried that a lot of the big processors will flood the market into China with trims, offal and bones, which will go towards making up that 205,000 metric tonnes,\" he said.\n\nHe said Australia's high-end products only made up 20 per cent of that annual quota.\n\n\"That could be chilled beef, Angus, wagyu products, and that's going to leave a big hole in the Chinese market for people looking for that higher-end product,\" he said.\n\nHe said once the quota was filled by June or July and his Chinese customers were unable to absorb the tariff, producers would need to reallocate their products to other markets.\n\n\"Naturally, when we reach out to those other potential customers, they'll straight away know that the tariff has taken effect on Australian produce and they'll play a little bit of hardball.\"\n\nMr Mackenzie said the federal government should work with the sector's peak bodies to implement a system to ensure fair access to the 205,000-tonne quota.\n\n\"So if you're selling product into China in 2024 and it was \"x\" amount of kilos or tonnages you might be allowed to have that quota for 2026, and then it won't be such a rush to the door,\" he said.\n\n\"It's just going to be a rush for people to pump that product into China. It'll just go into cold stores, be frozen and they'll just use it throughout the year.\"\n\nProfessor Ben Lyons, from the University of Southern Queensland's Rural Economies Centre of Excellence, said the Chinese beef industry was difficult to understand, but it had been declining as rural workers continued to drift to cities where wages were higher.\n\n\"A lot of Chinese peasantry have left the beef industry in China [and] we see a lot of aggregation, or larger herd sizes, to signify that,\" he said.\n\nProfessor Ben Lyons says the new tariff is another chapter in a challenging saga with China. (ABC News: Victoria Pengilley)\n\n\"It's another chapter in a long saga of dealing with China as an export country and a regime that looks to control its agrifood and geopolitical aspirations.\"\n\nTrump tariffs partly to blame\n\nGarry Edwards says higher-end cuts will be harder for Australia to shift. (Supplied: Cattle Australia)\n\nGarry Edwards said China was dealing with an oversupply of beef because South American exporters were locked out of the US market after US President Donald Trump imposed his own tariffs.\n\n\"They've diverted massive volumes of beef and put it into China at very moderate pricing, which has obviously had an impact on that market,\" he said.\n\nHe thinks Australia should not have been caught up in this tariff.\n\n\"That's certainly not what Australia has done,\" he said.\n\n\"Australia has continued to supply high-quality Australian beef at pricing that's consistent with the rest of our global contemporaries and it really sought to continue to meet the demand of Chinese consumers.\"\n\nAustralian wagyu producers are expected to feel the impact of China's new trade restrictions. (ABC News: Kerry Staight)\n\nImpact in Australia\n\nAustralian businesses, like Razorback Ranch in NSW, have been sending full-blood wagyu heifers to China as live exports.\n\nIt was a lucrative trade but owner Nick Togias said it had slowed in the past two years.\n\n\"At this stage, the direct impact of the Chinese tariffs is unclear,\" he said.\n\n\"However, global demand for Australian wagyu remains exceptionally strong across multiple regions,\" he said.\n\nHe also thinks the price of premium beef in Australia will remain high.\n\nCasino Food Company CEO Simon Stahl said his company would be significantly affected by the tariffs.\n\n\"It's about a quarter of our business, 20 to 25 per cent, so about a gross value of $100m is the business to China,\" he said.\n\nSimon Stahl says diverting exports to other markets will come at a price for producers. (ABC Rural: Kim Honan)\n\nHe said supply could be diverted to and increased in other export markets but that would cost Australia.\n\n\"It would be at a lower price and that's not going to be good for anyone, for processors and the farmers in this country,\" he said.\n\nPrice cut coming\n\nMeat analyst Simon Quilty, from Global AgriTrends, said Australian prices could drop in the last half of this year as other major beef exporters look for new markets.\n\n\"That's 600,000 tonnes globally that needs to find a new home, so you are now competing with more beef because others are impacted in the same way,\" he said.\n\nGarry Edwards, chair of Cattle Australia, said that, while lower-cost products could find a home in other markets in the US or South East Asia, the more expensive cuts would be harder to shift.\n\nAnd he said Chinese consumers would suffer as well.\n\n\"They're really doing themselves a disservice because if they don't get it from us, they're not going to get it from any other country around the world,\" he said.\n\n\"Ultimately, what they're going to do is push the price up domestically in their country for the high-quality marble beef that they buy from Australia.\"",

        "text": "For many caffeine enthusiasts, coffee pods are the shortcut to a cup of brew at home, and offer a cheaper option than buying from a cafe.\n\nCoffee pods were launched in Australia in the 90s, and an estimated 3 million are now used across the country each day.\n\nBetween 10 and 20 per cent of used pods are estimated to be recycled, meaning waste is mounting, and thousands of tonnes of single-use pods that cannot be easily recycled are relegated to landfill.\n\nDesigner Lizzie Burscough has been doing her part to curb waste for the last six years by upcycling the shells of used pods into colourful earrings.\n\nIn a quiet studio, Ms Burscough is working on her own piece of the waste puzzle. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nShe said she did not initially set out to find a solution to the waste issue.\n\n\"I saw [the used coffee pods], and I just wondered,\" she said.\n\nThe curiosity has spurred an effort that has diverted about 40,000 coffee pods away from landfill.\n\n\"I can use the entire pod, everything except the seal that gets perforated,\" Ms Burscough said.\n\n\"It's always tweaked my brain to repurpose things \u2026 some ideas land, and this one really landed,\" she said.\n\nCoffee pods from differing brands and varieties are being upcycled into earrings. (ABC News: Maren Preuss)\n\nThe process is fairly simple, with a growing list of contributors \u2014 friends, former clients of the ex-hairdresser or strangers found on social media \u2014 now collecting their pods to contribute.\n\nUtilising postage bags paid for by Ms Burscough, the pods are posted to an employee on the Gold Coast who empties and composts the coffee grinds, washes and \"bashes\" the shell flat before posting them to the artist.\n\n\"It's quite streamlined \u2026 and people really like the story, I do get stopped in the street and have people say 'I like your earrings', and so you can start this whole conversation,\" she said.\n\nCoffee grounds are removed from the used pod before the material is flattened to create the earrings base. (Supplied: Lizzie Burscough)\n\n\"People are a lot more conscious of sustainability now compared to when I started. It's a good talking point.\"\n\nTime and labour-intensive to recycle\n\nIn their standard form, coffee pods cannot be thrown into yellow-lidded recycling bins.\n\nThe coffee grounds can contaminate recycling in kerbside bins, and the size of the pod means they fall through cracks at recycling centres.\n\nTiziana Ferrero-Regis from the Queensland University of Technology's School of Design said the composition of the pod also makes things difficult.\n\n\"Coffee pods, capsules, single serve, whatever we want to call them, they're mostly non-recyclable or made from a mix of materials \u2026 polylaminate, aluminium, plastic,\" she said.\n\nMs Ferrero-Regis says producers should take more responsibility for their waste. (ABC News: Emily Dobson)\n\n\"These three layers need to be separated by hand, so it's time and labour consuming.\"\n\nAsking the average coffee drinker \u2014 many of whom use pods for convenience \u2014 to peel back their used pods layer by layer is not likely to generate results, Ms Ferrero-Regis said.\n\n\"When we ask [people] to do the right thing, we always go to consumers \u2026 and that is like us being responsible for saving the planet, it's a big ask.\"\n\nCoffee grounds need to be removed from the lining of a used pod before hand-recycling can begin, Ms Ferrero-Regis says. (Supplied)\n\nRather, she said, consumers tend to take the easier option, with many pods thrown in the standard waste bin of homes without a second thought.\n\n\"Producers need to be getting back their own waste. It's a much more complex problem than just the consumer doing the right thing,\" she said.\n\nProduct stewardship 'key'\n\nThe concept of taking responsibility for a product at all stages of life, including waste \u2014 known as product stewardship \u2014 is an innovation some companies have embraced.\n\nBig brands have jumped on board schemes like paid-postage bags and corporate drop-boxes to drive down the waste generated by products sold.\n\nAustralian not-for-profit organisation Planet Ark aims to create a circular economy, ensuring products have minimal waste and somewhere to go at the \"end of life\".\n\nAs part of the Planet Ark led scheme, used pods are processed at a dedicated facility. (Supplied: Nestl\u00e9 Australia)\n\nSitting between government, industry and consumer, Planet Ark acts as a guide to improve outcomes. Head of Product Stewardship Beau Boundy said this was the \"key\" to actually curbing waste.\n\n\"All of the major producers of coffee pods are trying to do the right thing \u2026 but they need a system to bring [used pods] together, to collect and process them into other materials so they can stay in the circular economy,\" he said.\n\n\"The efficiencies of having one system really can't be underrated \u2026 the more [producers] that face the same direction, the cheaper the scheme becomes.\"\n\nMr Boundy said Planet Ark has guided market share players in the coffee pod industry into a united coffee pod product stewardship scheme.\n\nBeau Boundy says the PodCycle scheme is able to capitalise on the good work already been done by producers to get their waste back. (ABC News: Kyle Harley)\n\nThe scheme, known as PodCycle, has been run on a trial basis since 2024 in specific locations in Victoria and New South Wales where coffee pods of all brands can be collected and recycled.\n\nIn 2026, organisers are planning to launch the scheme more broadly.\n\n\"That is the hope; there is certainly a lot of moving parts here. We've collected 55,000 pods via that system \u2026 at the moment, is more about the proof of that system working, so that is can be scaled up,\" Mr Boundy said.\n\nMore than 50,000 pods have been captured as part of the trial, which hopes to expand it's service in 2026. (Supplied: Nestl\u00e9 Australia)\n\nUntil then, it is hoped that pointing consumers in the right direction will help to change consumers from dumping coffee pod waste in kerbside bins.\n\n\"We all need to work together \u2026 to make sure that clear messaging is out there on how to keep these materials in the circular economy and out of landfill,\" he said.",

        "text": "Tesla has lost its title as the world's bestselling electric vehicle maker as a customer revolt over chief executive Elon Musk's right-wing politics, expiring US tax breaks for buyers and stiff overseas competition pushed sales down for a second year in a row.\n\nTesla said that it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9 per cent from a year earlier.\n\nIt makes Chinese rival BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, the new biggest EV maker.\n\nMusk, money and power Elon Musk's believers have once again agreed to enrich the Tesla boss to levels far beyond the realm of ordinary billionaires. But how much is enough?\n\nTesla sales were hit hard by the expiration of a $US7,500 ($11,200) tax credit for electric vehicle purchases that was phased out by the Trump administration at the end of September.\n\nThe latest quarter was the first with sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3 that Mr Musk unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales.\n\nThe new Model Y costs just under $US40,000, while customers can buy the cheaper Model 3 for under $US37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.\n\nRobotaxis boost investors' confidence\n\nTesla stock was down nearly 3 per cent at $US436.85 in afternoon trading on Friday, local time.\n\nHowever, the stock finished 2025 with an overall gain of about 11 per cent as investors bet that Mr Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make Tesla a leader in robotaxi services.\n\nTesla started rolling out its robotaxi service in Austin earlier this year, first with safety monitors in the cars to take over in case of trouble, then testing without them. The company has said it hoped to roll out the service in several cities this year.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said it would face a lot of regulatory challenges in doing this.\n\n\"We're dealing with people's lives,\" he said.\n\nTesla is under several federal safety investigations and other probes.\n\nTesla is the subject of a number of safety investigations. (Getty Images: Smith Collection/Gado)\n\nIn California, Tesla is at risk of temporarily losing its license to sell cars in the state after a judge there ruled it had misled customers about their safety.\n\nMr Musk has said he hopes software updates to his cars will enable hundreds of thousands of Tesla vehicles to operate autonomously with zero human intervention by the end of this year. The company is also planning to begin production of its AI-powered Cybercab with no steering wheel or pedals in 2026.\n\nTo keep Mr Musk focused on the company, Tesla's directors awarded him a potentially enormous new pay package that shareholders backed at the annual meeting in November.\n\nMr Musk could become the world's first trillionaire later this year when he sells shares of his rocket company, SpaceX, to the public for the first time.\n\nAP",

A lot of people don\u2019t want to do long-haul flights any more,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to know what\u2019s available to do in their own backyard, but they want to do it comfortably.\u201d An artist\u2019s impression of the Australian Star. Credit: Murray River Paddlesteamers The Australian Star will boast a restaurant, lounge and bar, a lift and 19 cabins with en suites, air-conditioning, and Wi-Fi, and will offer three-, four- or seven-night cruises. Cruise tickets cost between $890 and $1250 per night, per passenger, not including drinks outside dinner.\n\nThe route will wind 80 kilometres along the Murray River between Echuca and Torrumbarry Weir, with sights including the historic Perricoota Station homestead. Included are bus trips around Echuca historical sights and to Murray Gums Estate winery, the Great Aussie Beer Shed, silo art at Rochester and lunch at the Colbinabbin pub. An artist\u2019s impression of one of the cabins on the Australian Star. Credit: Murray River Paddlesteamers But Rohan says guests on the brothers\u2019 older, eight-cabin paddle steamer, Emmylou, often say they most loved having a barbecue on a river bank under the stars \u2013 an activity the Australian Star will also offer. \u201cI speak to a lot of guests, and the thing they say they like the most is this quiet and this slowing down, paddling along the river, the beauty of the landscape, and feeling like they\u2019re away from the cities,\u201d Rohan said.\n\nAt the heart of the Australian Star is its 119-year-old, 13-tonne steam engine in the hull, that will be powered by red gum. Echuca skipper Neil Hutchinson, a director (along with the twins) of Australian Star\u2019s parent company, Murray River Paddlesteamers, spotted the engine on Facebook and bought it from a collector in Truro, South Australia. Made in England in 1907, the engine has powered saw mills and farm machinery in Victoria. Most of the construction of the Australian Star in Mildura took 32 months, then in November it was sailed down the Murray to Echuca in 19 days \u2013 minus its top level so it could fit under bridges.\n\nRohan\u2019s love of paddle steamers started 47 years ago, at age 12, when his father, Paul, worked for the Victorian government on regional development, including helping the then-City of Echuca buy and operate the PS Pevensey, which dates from 1910. Over several years, Paul and Rohan, and sometimes Craig, volunteered with a group that helped restore the Pevensey. Rohan Burgess, left, as a boy, among volunteers including Andrew Cook, right, helping restore the paddle steamer Pevensey. \u201cI found it exciting,\u201d says Rohan, who still has his boyhood hoodie and T-shirt dubbing him \u201cPS Pevensey Crew\u201d. In 1983, Rohan watched proudly as the Pevensey starred, under the name Philadelphia, in the hit romance mini-series All the Rivers Run, starring Sigrid Thornton and John Waters.\n\nThe Emmylou, under the name Providence, also appeared in the drama, which was set in the 1890s\u2019 heyday of paddle steamers trading on the Murray. Rohan Burgess with the T-shirt he wore as a boy volunteer when he helped restore the PS Pevensey. Credit: Simon Schluter As adults, Rohan and Craig Burgess both became bankers. But in 2013, seeking a change, Rohan took up a job in Echuca as commercial manager for the Shire of Campaspe, which included managing the PS Pevensey. Vern Beasley, the then-owner of Murray River Paddlesteamers, which owned three paddle steamers including the Emmylou suggested Rohan buy the company.\n\nIn 2015, Rohan, Craig and Neil Hutchinson bought the company. In 2018, they renovated the Emmylou, removing its bunks and shared facilities and installing eight cabins with en suites which, Craig says, has since kept her almost booked out. But Emmylou is too small to accommodate a coach-load of tourists, and so the Australian Star project was born. Chair of advocacy group Committee for Echuca Moama Tim Ford said the launch of the Australian Star was \u201can exciting milestone for Echuca Moama and the wider Murray region\u201d.\n\n\u201cWith extended cruises and five-star facilities, it has the potential to attract high-value tourism, boost local businesses, and create new opportunities for jobs and investment,\u201d Ford said. Now that Australian Star is nearing its launch, Rohan says: \u201cIt\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s a bit of a \u2018pinch yourself\u2019 thing at the moment. It was a bit of a dream.\u201d The paddle steamer Australian Star passing under a bridge at Swan Hill on its 19-day voyage from Mildura to its current mooring near Echuca. Credit: Murray River Paddlesteamers Craig wants to see the Murray viewed as an international tourist drawcard alongside the Phillip Island penguins or the Twelve Apostles, and a local alternative to sleep-on-board luxury cruising in Europe. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is to reimagine the Murray as to what you can do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a river that you don\u2019t necessarily think about for a long river cruise.",

Loading Competitors typically qualify in three freestyle skiing disciplines \u2013 big air, slopestyle and halfpipe \u2013 but Brown is only competing in the halfpipe event for her first season. \u201cI\u2019d love to do all three events, but just for my first year on the circuit, it can be pretty chaotic travelling around and going to all the competitions that you need to qualify for,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, for my first one, I\u2019m just going to focus on halfpipe and just get lots of experience in it, so I\u2019m not flustered. And then hopefully, after this Olympics, I\u2019ll be able to go into the three disciplines with some more experience and navigate it better.\u201d\n\nFocusing on one discipline has been working for Brown, who was able to salvage silver at Copper Mountain despite crashing on her second run in the final. Brown\u2019s secret weapon is the \u201ccork 9\u201d, a mirror trick that shows you can spin both left and right. Indra Brown crashes in one of her runs in the half pipe final. Credit: Getty Images After launching herself up the wall of the halfpipe, Brown then performs two and a half rotations, which means she lands facing backwards. She then rides up the next wall backwards, before doing the same again but spinning the opposite direction. The trick is technically difficult, which means it scores well if executed properly.\n\nWhen judges are marking a run, they score skiers based on amplitude (height above the halfpipe), difficulty, execution, variety and progression. Skiers are in the halfpipe for about 30 seconds per run and do six tricks \u2013 three on each wall. It\u2019s always daunting trying a new trick for the first time, says Brown, but there are safety nets to help test them before you get into the halfpipe. \u201cI remember most of my first tries and definitely the nerves going into and just committing,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s always I feel is the scariest part for me, just getting over that mental factor or just committing to something that\u2019s unknown.\n\n\u201cThere are some airbag facilities [to train]. It\u2019s a fake snow in-run, made of these plastic bristles, and then it\u2019s a take-off into an airbag. It\u2019s like a blown-up bouncy castle, so we\u2019re able to safely try new tricks and not hurt ourselves.\u201d Loading However daunting Brown finds it, her mum is even more anxious. \u201cThe wall of the halfpipe is 7.2 metres, and then when they air out of it, depending on what amplitude they get, they add a number of extra feet,\u201d Anne says. \u201c[It\u2019s] quite frightening. I love watching all the kids compete in whatever sports they do, but I do admit watching them in the halfpipe does scare me quite a bit.\u201d",

So what can value-conscious travellers expect to spend if one of these destinations is on their bucket list?\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan, Italy, Greece, Croatia and Fiji topped the list from the 2026 Virtuoso Luxe Report, which surveyed 300 of the Virtuoso luxury travel network's advisers in Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've really got two clear types of travellers in the Australian market at the moment \u2014 high-end luxury, and then those people that are seeking value,\" Australian Travel Industry Association (ATIA) CEO Dean Long told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the broader travelling population, Indonesia, New Zealand, Japan, the United States and Thailand were the top outbound destinations this year, according to the ATIA's latest trends report.\n\n\n\nJapan, Italy, Greece, Croatia and Fiji topped the list from the 2026 Virtuoso Luxe Report, which surveyed 300 of the Virtuoso luxury travel network's advisers in Australia and New Zealand. But not all destinations attracting luxury travellers are necessarily the most expensive. Got your sights set on one of them? Here's a snapshot of some of the costs you can expect.\n\n\n\nJapan\n\nJapan, which has surged in popularity across the travel market in recent years, will remain a hotspot for Australians in 2026, Long said, in part because of favourable exchange rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You can really make the Aussie dollar go very far,\" he said. \"People are taking these opportunities now to really make the most of their time to get to Japan.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan topped Virtuoso's list for the first time this year, according to Greg Treasure, general manager of the luxury travel network for Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n\nJapan has become one of the hottest destinations for Australian travellers in recent years. Popular year-round, it draws tourists for ski season, Tokyo's city scene, Kyoto's stunning cherry blossom season, and many other attractions. Source: Getty / Francesco Riccardo Iacomino \"Italy, I think it's been our number one destination for quite some time,\" Treasure told SBS News. \"Japan has been extraordinarily popular, not only in the luxury space, but in the general travel space.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAirfares : Return airfares from Sydney to Tokyo start at around $700 if you're willing to make a stopover en route, or $1,100 for a direct journey, according to live Google Flights fares for next year.\n\n\n\n\n\nJapan is popular year-round, but in the popular cherry blossom season in March and April, many direct flights cost upwards of $1,500 return.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Revealed: The travel hotspots Australians are heading to this summer\n\nAccommodation: For a 3-star room in Tokyo, expect to spend at least $85 per night for a couple in April, during Japan's peak spring season. Prices on Booking.com start from around $60 in January, which is winter time in Japan.\n\n\n\n\n\nFood: A meal at an inexpensive restaurant in Tokyo can range from about $7.80 to $14.60, according to the Numbeo global cost of living database. On average, a coffee will set you back around $4.90 and a beer around $5.80, the crowdsourced database suggests.\n\n\n\nItaly\n\nWhile Italy will always be popular, Treasure said, price pressures, overtourism and crowding have put many travellers off European destinations in recent years.\n\n\n\nThe Colosseum is one of Rome's biggest drawcards, along with its food, history, culture and iconic landmarks.

That starting price goes up to roughly $1,940 in July, a peak travel month.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodation: The cheapest 3-star rooms on Booking.com for Dubrovnik in July start at about $140 a night.

This is potentially a billion dollars, not just ripped out of farmers pockets, but regional communities pockets. That's money that flows through the local town, from the cafe right through to the stock and station merchant. So we've got to understand, this is a huge shift. It's a tariff on anything above our quota. We usually hit that quota anywhere from between July and September every year, and that means that our beef will have a tariff and we'll have to find a new market.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor 2026, China is setting a total global import quota of 2.7 million tonnes, allocating 205,000 tonnes to Australia, though Australian exporters have exceeded this limit by a large margin in previous years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move also impacts other major suppliers like Brazil and the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, critics like Cattle Australia chairman Garry Edwards say the restrictions contravene the spirit of the free trade agreement established between China and Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Seven's Sunrise, Liberal Senator Jane Hume said the announcement has taken the government and the industry by surprise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We export around 300,000 tonnes of beef to China every single year. These quotas kick in at 200,000 tonnes. So you can see that why the industry is estimating that it's going to be a hit of around a billion dollars. Now we'd urge the government to use everything in their power, all of their contacts, which apparently are very good. Let's not forget that Xi Jinping referred to Anthony Albanese as his handsome boy only a couple of years ago, we would urge the government to use every contact they have to try and lift the ban.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tax hike is following a year-long investigation by Chinese authorities into rising imports and market competition.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of 2024, Australia accounted for about 8 per cent of China\u2019s overall beef imports.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe CEO of the Australian Meat Industry Council, Tim Ryan, says the measure will see Australian beef exports to China cut by one-third.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says this will cost the industry approximately A$1 billion in losses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The challenge for us is that the quota allocated to Australia is significantly below what we have been trading into the market over the last 12 months. So going forward, we are expecting it to hinder what we will be exporting into China - going forward - to the degree of about a third of what we're currently doing. I don't think anyone can afford a 55 per cent tax on top of the price of beef. So when that happens we will then redirect exports to alternative markets.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Sussan Ley says Australia will not accept a $1 billion hit to its bottom line.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe describes the Australian beef industry as an export powerhouse that anchors international trade for domestic commodities.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says this influence is most evident in Australia\u2019s trade relationship with China.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Prime Minister should be getting on the phone to his Chinese counterpart and make it very clear indeed that the excuses that he gave yesterday with respect to beef tariffs will not cut it with Australians, and they certainly won't cut it with Australian farmers, who I am proud to represent here in rural Australia. For the Prime Minister to say, 'Oh, well, everyone is affected by this - we haven't been singled out,' is pathetic. What he needs to do is step right up, call his counterparts. Have the conversation with President Xi. He says he has a good relationship with President Xi. He needs to call on that relationship now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says Australia has not been singled out by China.\n\n\n\n",

First, he said that a Commonwealth Royal Commission would be too broad and too wide, failing to recognise that antisemitism is a national crisis.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYoung Australians are being offered a financial boost of up to $10,000 to take up apprenticeships in the building and renewable energy sectors.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt comes as part of the federal government\u2019s $22.7 billion Future Made in Australia plan, which is using public incentives to drive private investment into local manufacturing and the net-zero transition.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe payments began yesterday as part of the \"Key Apprenticeship Program\" designed to help reach the national goal of building 1.2 million homes by 2029 and meeting net-zero targets.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinister for Social Services Tanya Plibersek describes the program as a vital investment to drive workers into high-demand trades where job opportunities are rapidly expanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe also see apprentices benefiting by around $10,000 in that key apprenticeship program to encourage more Australians to undertake an apprenticeship, particularly in the building trades and in the renewable energy sector, where the jobs are booming.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Northern Territory government has announced it will introduce a bill on voluntary assisted dying after a months-long parliamentary inquiry into the matter finished in September 2025.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney-General Marie-Clare Boothby says the government is drafting legislation now, with the bill to be introduced to parliament midway through 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the legislation will be subject to a conscience vote, meaning party members could vote in line with their personal beliefs.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed legislation comes almost two decades after the Commonwealth vetoed the NT's world first euthanasia legislation in 1997.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo sport now and in the AFL\n\n\n\n\n\nDual Brisbane Lions premiership hero Lachie Neale has stepped down as the club's co-captain.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeale, who has lifted the last two AFL premiership cups aloft with Harris Andrews, will vacate his leadership role for 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeale has been at the centre of tabloid speculation about his marriage breaking down in recent weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeaking to media, Neale says the decision does not mean he's stepping away from the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I'm going to be here for this season coming up, and I'm fully committed to putting everything I can into footy and can't wait to get into training, and yeah, looking forward to it.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "By the time Usman Khawaja announced his retirement from international cricket, his place in Australian cricket history was already secure.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 39-year-old will farewell fans at the Sydney Cricket Ground from Sunday, bringing down the curtain on an international career spanning 88 Tests, during which he finished as Australia's 15th-highest run-scorer with 6,206 runs (so far).\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This game humbles you. It tests your patience, your resilience and your character, and if you're lucky, it teaches you gratitude, even on days that don't go your way,\" said Khawaja as he announced his retirement on Friday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\nCricket Australia CEO Todd Greenberg congratulated Khawaja for his \"huge contribution\" to Australian cricket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Usman has been one of Australia's most reliable opening batters, and testament to his success was him being named ICC [International Cricket Council] Test cricketer of the year the same season that Australia won the World Test Championship,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\n\nVeteran Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja has announced his retirement from international cricket. Source: AAP / Robbie Stephenson But there are many reasons why Khawaja is widely regarded as a trailblazer in Australian sport \u2014 his influence extending his performance on the oval.\n\n\n\nFirst Muslim player in Australian cricket\n\nBorn in Pakistan, Khawaja moved to Australia with his family at the age of five. He went on to become the first Pakistani-born Australian and first Muslim to play for Australia in the 2011 Sydney Ashes Test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I'm a proud Muslim coloured boy from Pakistan who was told that he would never play for the Australian cricket team,\" he told reporters on Friday. \"Look at me now.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKhawaja made his first-class debut for NSW in 2008 and, over the course of his career, experienced both highs and lows \u2014 including time away from his home state, recurring injuries, and periods on the sidelines.\n\n\n\nAt age 39, Usman Khawaja will become Australia's oldest Test player in 40 years at the SCG on Sunday. Source: AAP / Robbie Stephenson Yet he seized every opportunity to make an impact. That included a remarkable return to the Test side in 2021, when rival Travis Head was sidelined after contracting COVID-19, allowing Khawaja to reclaim his place in the team.\n\n\n\n\n\nKhawaja's success on the international stage, combined with his charismatic personality, has inspired many within the Pakistani Australian community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Usman was not only a dependable and elegant batter, but also a symbol of resilience, inclusion and leadership,\" head of Sydney-based Pacers Cricket Academy Sohail Shah told SBS Urdu.\n\n\n\n\n\nShah said Khawaja had inspired countless other cricketers by proving that \"belief, patience and character\" matter \"just as much as talent\".\n\n\n\nInvesting in cricket youth\n\nIn 2018, Khawaja launched the non-profit Usman Khawaja Foundation to support young people from disadvantaged backgrounds in pursuing their passion for cricket.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt runs free introductory cricket programs for primary school-aged children from \"non-traditional cricketing communities\" in NSW and Queensland, according to the foundation's website.\n\n\n\n\n\nHerman Lotey, program coordinator at Usman Khawaja Foundation, said Khawaja has made \"great positive impacts\" on many Australian families.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A lot of these families haven't played cricket, they haven't played sports before, just purely because of the cost of participating in programs,\" he told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To get that opportunity to play in a free sporting program, that's made a positive impact on them. That's connected them with the local cricket club or association, and they can continue to pursue that as well in the future.\"\n\n\n\nIn 2018, Usman Khawaja launched a non-profit to support young people from disadvantaged backgrounds in pursuing their passion for cricket. Source: AAP / James Ross \"And hopefully, we would see more players like Usman represent our country that reflects the multicultural society that we have,\" Lotey said.\n\n\n\n\n\nReflecting on his career, Khawaja said he hoped he had inspired many children to fall in love with cricket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I hope I've inspired many children along the way, particularly those who feel that they are different, those who feel that they don't belong, or those [who] others tell that they will never make it,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I felt all these things growing up and trying to be an Australian cricketer. But seeing is believing. And I'm here to tell you that you can do whatever you want.\"\n\n\n\nOutspoken on Gaza\n\nKhawaja has also used his profile to advocate for humanitarian causes, including speaking about the civilian death toll in Gaza after the Hamas-Israel conflict escalated in 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn multiple occasions, he planned to play Test matches while wearing symbols and slogans that he said were a plea for human rights to be respected in Gaza.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) repeatedly denied such requests , citing its code of conduct, and reprimanded him for wearing a black armband while playing a Test in Perth in December 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, Khawaja accused the ICC of double standards in how they enforced regulations around what players wore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think enough is enough,\" said Khawaja in an interview with SBS News in August.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe batter was in Parliament House in Canberra at the time, as he joined calls for sanctions on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and pausing trade with Israel until it reversed a blockade on humanitarian aid entering Gaza.\n\n\n\n\"Khawaja has been unravelling his stance on Gaza, speaking out of Israeli killing of civilians, the dehumanisation of Palestinians, and the moral and silence of institutions,\" Zia Ahmed, editor-in-chief of Muslim Australian Times, told SBS Urdu.\n\n\n\n\n\nAhmed said Khawaja will be remembered as more than a cricketer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Thank you for the runs, and thank you for the courage.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with SBS Urdu.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Veteran Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja has announced his retirement from international cricket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"God, through cricket, has given me far more than I ever imagined,\" he told reporters at a press conference at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Friday morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"He's given me memories I'll carry forever, friendships that go well beyond the game, and lessons that shaped me, who I am off the field.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nKhawaja said the fifth Ashes Test of the series at the SCG \u2014 where he made his debut in 2011 \u2014 will be his last.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis announcement followed months of speculation about his future. He was unable to open in the first Ashes Test in Perth in November due to back spasms and then missed the Brisbane Test last month with the injury.\n\n\n\nAt age 39, he will become Australia's oldest Test player in 40 years at the SCG on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe will finish with 88 Tests to his name, having already risen to be Australia's 15th greatest run-scorer in history with 6,206.\n\n\n\nKhawaja criticises double standards in cricket\n\nOn-field accomplishments aside, Khawaja has been widely regarded as a trailblazer in Australian sport.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first Muslim to play Test cricket for Australia, he's been a prominent advocate for inclusion and representation, speaking openly about faith, racism and belonging at the elite level.\n\n\n\n\n\nKhawaja has also used his profile to advocate for humanitarian causes, and he has been a vocal supporter of the people of Gaza during Israel's post-October-7 military campaign in the enclave.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Aid agencies in Gaza condemn Israel's suspension of their licences to operate SBS News 03:07 English\n\nHe used Friday's announcement as a chance to highlight issues that still exist within the game, beginning with coverage of his back spasms this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nKhawaja was heavily criticised in some quarters for playing golf in the lead up to the Perth Test, before the spasms forced him from the field and then ruled him out of Brisbane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I could have copped it for two days, but I copped it for five days straight,\" Khawaja said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It wasn't even about my performances, it was about something very personal. It was about my preparation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The way that everyone came at me about my preparation was quite personal in terms of things like 'he's not committed to the team, he was only worried about himself, he played this golf comp the day before, he's selfish, he doesn't train hard enough, he's lazy'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"These are the same racial stereotypes that I've grown up with my whole life.\"\n\n\n\nKhawaja said the comments from former players and those in the media were at odds with the way other injuries were spoken about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can give you countless number of guys who have played golf the day before a match and have been injured, but you guys haven't said a thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can give you even more examples of guys who have had 15 schooners the night before a game and have then been injured, but no-one said a word because they were just being Aussie larrikins, they were just being lads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But when I get injured, everyone went at my credibility and who I am as a person.\n\n\n\n\n\nKhawaja believed part of that commentary came down to the fact he had been outspoken on political issues in recent years, and the most notably the plight of Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\"I kind of know why I get nailed a lot of the time, particularly over the last two years,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I understand that I've talked about certain issues outside cricket which leaves me exposed and a lot of people don't like that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I still find it hard when I say that everyone deserves freedom and that Palestinians deserve freedom and equal rights, and why that's a big issue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But I get it because I put myself out there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Even when we get to Australian politics and we get all these right-wing politicians that are anti-immigration and (fuel) Islamophobia and I speak up against them, I know that people don't love that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But I feel like I have to because where these guys are trying to divide and create hate and trying to create animosity in the Australian community, I'm doing the exact opposite.\"\n\n\n\nSCG fitting location for Khawaja's farewell\n\nHis decision to walk away also means the Sydney Test will also turn into something of a farewell party, with the series decided and Australia 3-1 up.\n\n\n\n\n\nSydney will be a fitting location for his final Test, given so much of his career has been based around the city he moved to as a four-year-old from Islamabad, Pakistan.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis 2011 debut against England, in which he scored 37 runs, offered Australian fans hope at the end of the worst home summer this century.\n\n\n\nUsman Khawaja with his wife Rachel and children Aisha and Ayla at the Sydney Cricket Ground, where Khawaja will soon play his final Test match. Source: AAP / Dan Himbrechts And it was at the SCG where he revived his career as a 35-year-old, scoring twin centuries against England when Travis Head missed a Test in 2022 during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat Test prompted one of the great late-career revivals, hitting seven centuries in his first two years back in the side as part of a dominant opening partnership with childhood friend David Warner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 With additional reporting from the Australian Associated Press.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\u201cPeople love cruising. A lot of people don\u2019t want to do long-haul flights any more,\u201d he said. \u201cThey want to know what\u2019s available to do in their own backyard, but they want to do it comfortably.\u201d An artist\u2019s impression of the Australian Star. Credit: Murray River Paddlesteamers The Australian Star will boast a restaurant, lounge and bar, a lift and 19 cabins with en suites, air-conditioning, and Wi-Fi, and will offer three-, four- or seven-night cruises. Cruise tickets cost between $890 and $1250 per night, per passenger, not including drinks outside dinner.\n\nThe route will wind 80 kilometres along the Murray River between Echuca and Torrumbarry Weir, with sights including the historic Perricoota Station homestead. Included are bus trips around Echuca historical sights and to Murray Gums Estate winery, the Great Aussie Beer Shed, silo art at Rochester and lunch at the Colbinabbin pub. An artist\u2019s impression of one of the cabins on the Australian Star. Credit: Murray River Paddlesteamers But Rohan says guests on the brothers\u2019 older, eight-cabin paddle steamer, Emmylou, often say they most loved having a barbecue on a river bank under the stars \u2013 an activity the Australian Star will also offer. \u201cI speak to a lot of guests, and the thing they say they like the most is this quiet and this slowing down, paddling along the river, the beauty of the landscape, and feeling like they\u2019re away from the cities,\u201d Rohan said.\n\nAt the heart of the Australian Star is its 119-year-old, 13-tonne steam engine in the hull, that will be powered by red gum. Echuca skipper Neil Hutchinson, a director (along with the twins) of Australian Star\u2019s parent company, Murray River Paddlesteamers, spotted the engine on Facebook and bought it from a collector in Truro, South Australia. Made in England in 1907, the engine has powered saw mills and farm machinery in Victoria. Most of the construction of the Australian Star in Mildura took 32 months, then in November it was sailed down the Murray to Echuca in 19 days \u2013 minus its top level so it could fit under bridges.\n\nRohan\u2019s love of paddle steamers started 47 years ago, at age 12, when his father, Paul, worked for the Victorian government on regional development, including helping the then-City of Echuca buy and operate the PS Pevensey, which dates from 1910. Over several years, Paul and Rohan, and sometimes Craig, volunteered with a group that helped restore the Pevensey. Rohan Burgess, left, as a boy, among volunteers including Andrew Cook, right, helping restore the paddle steamer Pevensey. \u201cI found it exciting,\u201d says Rohan, who still has his boyhood hoodie and T-shirt dubbing him \u201cPS Pevensey Crew\u201d. In 1983, Rohan watched proudly as the Pevensey starred, under the name Philadelphia, in the hit romance mini-series All the Rivers Run, starring Sigrid Thornton and John Waters.\n\nThe Emmylou, under the name Providence, also appeared in the drama, which was set in the 1890s\u2019 heyday of paddle steamers trading on the Murray. Rohan Burgess with the T-shirt he wore as a boy volunteer when he helped restore the PS Pevensey. Credit: Simon Schluter As adults, Rohan and Craig Burgess both became bankers. But in 2013, seeking a change, Rohan took up a job in Echuca as commercial manager for the Shire of Campaspe, which included managing the PS Pevensey. Vern Beasley, the then-owner of Murray River Paddlesteamers, which owned three paddle steamers including the Emmylou suggested Rohan buy the company.\n\nIn 2015, Rohan, Craig and Neil Hutchinson bought the company. In 2018, they renovated the Emmylou, removing its bunks and shared facilities and installing eight cabins with en suites which, Craig says, has since kept her almost booked out. But Emmylou is too small to accommodate a coach-load of tourists, and so the Australian Star project was born. Chair of advocacy group Committee for Echuca Moama Tim Ford said the launch of the Australian Star was \u201can exciting milestone for Echuca Moama and the wider Murray region\u201d.\n\n\u201cWith extended cruises and five-star facilities, it has the potential to attract high-value tourism, boost local businesses, and create new opportunities for jobs and investment,\u201d Ford said. Now that Australian Star is nearing its launch, Rohan says: \u201cIt\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s a bit of a \u2018pinch yourself\u2019 thing at the moment. It was a bit of a dream.\u201d The paddle steamer Australian Star passing under a bridge at Swan Hill on its 19-day voyage from Mildura to its current mooring near Echuca. Credit: Murray River Paddlesteamers Craig wants to see the Murray viewed as an international tourist drawcard alongside the Phillip Island penguins or the Twelve Apostles, and a local alternative to sleep-on-board luxury cruising in Europe. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is to reimagine the Murray as to what you can do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a river that you don\u2019t necessarily think about for a long river cruise.",

        "text": "An Olympic debut wasn\u2019t even on her radar a year ago. But Brown has had an exceptional year. \u201cI just kind of thought, OK, she\u2019s super passionate about what she\u2019s doing, and she\u2019s just really enjoying herself,\u201d Anne says. \u2018To come away with a bronze was definitely unexpected and super exciting.\u2019 Indra Brown on her impressive World Cup results \u201cFor her, it\u2019s a challenge against herself, not so much against her competition ... I think it\u2019s just been quite organic in terms of the progression and the improvement [she\u2019s] been making. \u201cAnd then the North American season that we\u2019ve just had, was probably when I was like, OK, she\u2019s not bad, she\u2019s doing OK.\u201d\n\nBrown is definitely doing OK. The Melbourne teenager has stunned in her short time on the World Cup circuit, and has two more competitions \u2013 in Calgary and Aspen \u2013 before Olympic selections are finalised. Loading Competitors typically qualify in three freestyle skiing disciplines \u2013 big air, slopestyle and halfpipe \u2013 but Brown is only competing in the halfpipe event for her first season. \u201cI\u2019d love to do all three events, but just for my first year on the circuit, it can be pretty chaotic travelling around and going to all the competitions that you need to qualify for,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, for my first one, I\u2019m just going to focus on halfpipe and just get lots of experience in it, so I\u2019m not flustered. And then hopefully, after this Olympics, I\u2019ll be able to go into the three disciplines with some more experience and navigate it better.\u201d\n\nFocusing on one discipline has been working for Brown, who was able to salvage silver at Copper Mountain despite crashing on her second run in the final. Brown\u2019s secret weapon is the \u201ccork 9\u201d, a mirror trick that shows you can spin both left and right. Indra Brown crashes in one of her runs in the half pipe final. Credit: Getty Images After launching herself up the wall of the halfpipe, Brown then performs two and a half rotations, which means she lands facing backwards. She then rides up the next wall backwards, before doing the same again but spinning the opposite direction. The trick is technically difficult, which means it scores well if executed properly.\n\nWhen judges are marking a run, they score skiers based on amplitude (height above the halfpipe), difficulty, execution, variety and progression. Skiers are in the halfpipe for about 30 seconds per run and do six tricks \u2013 three on each wall. It\u2019s always daunting trying a new trick for the first time, says Brown, but there are safety nets to help test them before you get into the halfpipe. \u201cI remember most of my first tries and definitely the nerves going into and just committing,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s always I feel is the scariest part for me, just getting over that mental factor or just committing to something that\u2019s unknown.\n\n\u201cThere are some airbag facilities [to train]. It\u2019s a fake snow in-run, made of these plastic bristles, and then it\u2019s a take-off into an airbag. It\u2019s like a blown-up bouncy castle, so we\u2019re able to safely try new tricks and not hurt ourselves.\u201d Loading However daunting Brown finds it, her mum is even more anxious. \u201cThe wall of the halfpipe is 7.2 metres, and then when they air out of it, depending on what amplitude they get, they add a number of extra feet,\u201d Anne says. \u201c[It\u2019s] quite frightening. I love watching all the kids compete in whatever sports they do, but I do admit watching them in the halfpipe does scare me quite a bit.\u201d",

Diseases, weeds, fire ants, and even cane toads are known to routinely hitchhike in and around vehicles, spreading pests to new locations.\n\nThe Invasive Species Council has advised that seeds from plants often attach to mud on tyres, boots and clothing. While fruit and vegetables carried across state lines can spread insects and other pathogens.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of different ways in which potential new invasive species or existing invasive species can travel with humans,\u201d Invasive Species Council policy director, Dr Carol Booth, told Yahoo News.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThere are biosecurity inspections at some major border crossings, but mostly the onus is on travellers to do the right thing and dispose of produce before leaving the state.\n\nSurprise moments animals have stowed away in vehicles\n\nFinding problematic items can be a challenge, and to be safe, it\u2019s good practice to regularly inspect and wash your vehicle.\n\nLast summer, a Peron's tree frog, which is native to mainland Australia, was discovered in a Tasmanian car park, leading authorities to believe it had travelled inside a vehicle that ferried over Bass Strait.\n\nWhile across the ditch in New Zealand, a flightless bird travelled 280km inside a camper\u2019s ute.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also relatively common for people visiting bushland areas to accidentally carry home a large snake or even a lizard as these cases highlight.\n\nSpecies like gazanias, which are sold at nurseries as garden plants, can destroy entire paddocks if they are carried into rural areas.\n\nAnd a single South African weed orchid can spread thousands of seeds if accidentally disturbed.\n\nThis bed, imported by an Australian retailer from China, contained four China fir borers (Semanotus sinoauster).

Source: AAP\n\nChristmas presents could harbour hidden biosecurity risk\n\nWith thousands of presents being imported from overseas by online shoppers for Christmas, the risk of invasive species breaching our borders increases.\n\nBooth said problematic items include seeds that are either illegal or invasive, and presents that contain insects.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWe need people to be always conscious of what the risks are, and that's either in what they deliberately buy or what comes in accidentally,\u201d she said.\n\nLove Australia's weird and wonderful environment? \ud83d\udc0a\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\ude33 Get our new newsletter showcasing the week\u2019s best stories.",

        "text": "If one of your New Year's resolutions was to have more financial freedom, tonight's Saturday Lotto $30 Million Megadraw could be the ticket. The draw comes just one day after an Adelaide retiree realised she'd won the $20 million Christmas Day Powerball jackpot.\n\nIt's estimated one-in-three Aussie adults will purchase a ticket in the $30m draw, with more than 2,500 tickets per minute expected to be sold at peak times. The biggest rushes are around midday on the day of the draw, and in the last hours before the draw closes.\n\nThe Lott spokesperson Matt Hart told Yahoo News it's not uncommon to see a last minute purchase take out a division one prize.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"That's such a sliding doors moment, right? Because you're sort of sitting there going, 'Will I get a ticket or not?'\" he said.\n\n\"And in hindsight you think, 'I'm glad I did grab that ticket because that changed everything'.\"\n\nSaturday Lotto creates the most millionaires \u2014 here's why\n\nSaturday Lotto frequently has multiple division one winning entries and is known as the game that creates the most millionaires.\n\nMr Hart said there's a simple reason why.\n\n\"It is because you only have to match six winning numbers, whereas Powerball, you have to match seven numbers and a Powerball. That's why the odds are are higher.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\"It is the least challenging to win compared to other games. So that's why we have more winners.\"\n\nThe last January Megadraw, on January 4 last year, saw 14 division one winning entries take home more than $2 million each.\n\nMr Hart said it is important to register your ticket to ensure you don't miss out on the winnings if you can't find your ticket.\n\nHe will be calling all registered winners on Sunday to confirm the good news.\n\n\"I will be hitting the phones tomorrow,\" he said.\n\n\"Some people will have perhaps checked [their tickets] tonight and they'll know, so they'll be sitting around all night waiting for confirmation and other people will be completely unaware and they'll just be surprised.\"\n\nThere's a good chance there will be multiple winners in tonight's draw. Source: The Lott\n\nHot and cold lotto numbers\n\nAccording to The Lott, the top three types of tickets to score a division one win in Saturday Lotto were system entries, 12-game entries and 18-game entries.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nData from the past 40 years has revealed the most frequently drawn numbers \u2014 though it's important to remember that each number has an equal chance of being picked.\n\nThe most commonly drawn numbers were 1, 11, 8 and 42.\n\nThe least drawn were 44, 27, 14 and 30.\n\nThe $30 million Megadraw draw closes at 7:30pm AEST on Saturday, January 3.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
