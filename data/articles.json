It will likely be a few months before the full impact of tariffs on business decisions, hiring and inflation show up.\n\nConsumer sentiment and the stock market have both rebounded from peak uncertainty in early April, Dimon said, but it's important to recognise that neither \"consumer sentiment nor businesses\" ever determine the key \"inflection points\" for how the economy is faring.\n\nThe hard data, like job growth and inflation, is what matters most, Dimon said.\n\n\"You haven't seen an effect yet other than in the sentiment,\" Dimon said. \"And maybe in July, August, September, October, you'll start to see, did it have an effect? My guess is it did, hopefully not dramatic.\"\n\n\"Employment will come down a little bit. Inflation will go up a little bit,\" Dimon said. \"Hopefully, it's just a little bit.\"\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is pictured in Washington, DC, in October 2024. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images via CNN)\n\nThe latest Consumer Price Index data showed inflation cooled more than expected in May. But Dimon said he's worried about inflation and economic growth because Trump's tariffs and deportations could change things.\n\nHe also added that lower immigration to the US could hurt the economy.\n\n\"These are a lot of moving parts,\" he said.\n\n\"The buts are real, and I am not trying to be negative,\" Dimon said. \"You have all these really complex moving tectonic plates around trade, economics, geopolitics.\"\n\nHe added that the impact of tariffs might disrupt the economy but won't make the \"ship go down.\"",

        "text": "A Melbourne woman who racked up a $130,000 student debt, as well as $30,000 in up-front university fees, says she now regrets some of the expensive study choices she made as an 18-year-old.\n\nMonica, who asked for her surname to be withheld, will graduate this year and become a registered psychologist after six years of study.\n\nWhile Monica said she was still happy with her career choice, there were many things she would like to go back and tell her teenage self.\n\nMelbourne psychology student has a student debt of $130,000 and has paid $33,000 for her master's degree after hitting the HECS/HELP cap. (iStock)\n\nMonica grew up in a low-income household and, after finishing school, she didn't have much parental support.\n\n\"I got kicked out of home. I was 18 years old and completely on my own,\" she said.\n\nAs she was selecting her first degree, Monica remembers steering clear of Victoria's more prestigious universities, such as Monash University and the University of Melbourne, because she believed they had the highest fees.\n\nHowever, she soon found herself \"sucked in\" by the marketing campaigns of private tertiary education providers.\n\nShe ended up enrolling in a Bachelor of Criminology and Justice degree with one of those tertiary training colleges, the main drawcard of which was that students could finish the degree in two years instead of three.\n\n\"That was really attractive to me because I was living out of home. I was thinking, 'This will help me find a job faster,'\" she said.\n\n\"And the reality was, when I finished, it didn't actually help me find a job faster. No-one cared that you had finished a degree in two years.\"\n\nThat degree cost Monica $66,000 and now makes up a large portion of her debt.\n\nOne key thing Monica said she didn't realise when she signed up for the degree was that there were Commonwealth Supported Places (CSPs) on offer at universities teaching the same degree.\n\nA CSP is a subsidised place at an Australian university or approved higher education provider where part of your fees are paid by the government.\n\nThose fees do not need to be repaid and are not a loan.\n\nIn Monica's case, getting a CSP at a university would have halved her fees.\n\nMonica said she was \"beside herself\" several years later when she found out how much she could have saved in student fees.\n\n\"I just felt very naive and embarrassed,\" she said.\n\n\"I wish that I was more aware of what a Commonwealth Supported Place was, and what it can actually do for you.\"\n\nAfter finishing her criminology degree, Monica ended up completing a graduate diploma at the same private tertiary college.\n\nHowever, she then needed to study for a further graduate diploma at Deakin University, which included a thesis component, before qualifying for entry to a master's degree in professional psychology, also at Deakin University.\n\nMonica completed an undergraduate degree and a diploma at a private tertiary training college, before studying for another diploma and her master's at Deakin University. (iStock)\n\nAs she had reached the HECS/HELP borrowing limit of $126,000 - the amount is higher for some students studying some courses, such as Medicine - Monica needed to pay the $33,000 for her master's degree up front.\n\nIn order to afford the fees, Monica took two years off her studies and work full-time.\n\n\"I pretty much saved like mad, so I could actually afford to pay for the master's degree up-front,\" she said.\n\nThe cost of a university degree can vary wildly depending on the course studied and at which institution.\n\nUnder changes implemented by the Coalition government in 2021, some courses, such as Arts-related degrees, became more expensive, while the fees for others, like teaching and nursing, were reduced.\n\nDepartment of Education figures released last July show arts, law and commerce students can expect to pay nearly $17,000 a year for their courses, compared to just over $4600 for agriculture or nursing students.\n\nA person graduating from a three-year nursing degree would expect a student loan debt of $14,000.\n\nBut a recent graduate of a three-year degree in history would have a HECS debt of $51,000.\n\nLast year, the Albanese Government retrospectively changed the way HECS/HELP debts are indexed in response to a public outcry when indexation rates - tied to inflation - hit 7.1 per cent in July 2023.\n\nIndexation is now based on either the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or Wage Price Index (WPI), whichever is lower.\n\nDuring his election campaign, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also committed to slashing the HECS/HELP debts by 20 per cent , with Labor saying it plans to introduce the required legislation as its first bill when parliament resumes later this month.\n\nWhile the changes were likely to be a big help, Monica - who is now 28 years old - said she could still foresee her huge student debt holding her back.\n\n\"I definitely think this will be a major issue for me in the long term, especially in terms of housing,\" she said.\n\nWhile a bank manager had recently assured Monica she would likely still be able to get a home loan because she had been frugal in her spending, it would still be a burden, she said.\n\n\"It will create difficulties for me in the sense that, rather than building upon other things in my life that could be really helpful for me, I'll be paying this off for a very long time.\"\n\nMonica said she wanted to warn young people to do their research when looking to enrol in a tertiary education course.\n\n\"You need to do your due diligence and really explore and compare all of the different courses that are offered at the different universities. It's surprising how much variation there can be,\" she said.\n\nFinance expert Joel Gibson agreed, saying people shouldn't be treating student loans as \"free money\".\n\n\"When you enrol in a degree, you're effectively taking out a loan for tens of thousands of dollars,\" he said.\n\n\"Ideally, that loan is what we call 'good debt' - it's funding your personal growth and empowering you to make many times that money back later in life.\n\n\"HECS/HELP and other student loans are some of the cheapest and most productive debt you can have, but they're still debt and they're not a bottomless well of support.\n\n\"Don't dive in if you're not sure - take some time off study to make a plan, or start working and see where your passion leads you.",

        "text": "Before Che Kenneally can step into the ring to defend a boxing world title next month, the 30-year-old Gold Coaster must raise thousands of dollars for the privilege.\n\nAs a professional boxer, Kenneally's light-heavyweight bouts have to be sanctioned by one of the sport's governing bodies \u2014 in Kenneally's case, the World Boxing Association (WBA).\n\nSanctioning costs, which can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars, are often covered by boxing promoters who recoup their investment by selling tickets, broadcast rights and access to fights.\n\nFemale fighters punch their way from a backyard shed to the world stage Photo shows A composite photo of three female boxers The dream for boxers Skye Nicolson, Che Kenneally and Cherneka Robinson all started in the same Gold Coast garage.\n\nBut female fighters are rarely afforded this luxury, and Kenneally will need to stump up more than $25,000 to enter the ring.\n\nTo reach that financial goal, the single mother has turned to community fundraising while working full time as a stevedore at the Port of Brisbane.\n\n\"I still have to fit in two training sessions per day and try to find the funds to fight,\" Kenneally said.\n\n\"You're either at one end of the spectrum where you're killing it as an athlete \u2026 or you're on the other end, living pay cheque to pay cheque, doing your best and that's still not enough.\"\n\nKenneally won the WBA light-heavyweight title in June 2024. (Supplied: Instagram)\n\nDefending her title is not the first time Kenneally has had to pay to fight \u2014 to challenge for the then-vacant world title last year, she raised funds and used sponsorship and a loan to cover the costs.\n\nAs the champion, the stakes are higher; if she can't raise the sanctioning fees before the July deadline and the fight is cancelled, she will have to give up her title without the opportunity to defend it.\n\nNarrow, steep and treacherous path\n\nKenneally's position is a \"path well-trodden\" by professional athletes, according to the director of La Trobe University's Centre for Sport and Social Impact, Geoff Dickson.\n\n\"The pathway to being a fully-fledged, highly remunerated professional athlete is a very difficult journey for men and women,\" Dr Dickson said.\n\nNo women in top 100 highest-paid athletes Photo shows Ben Simmons puts his hands on his hips while someone holds a basketball above his head at LA Clippers NBA training. Despite missing more games than he played for the past three years, former NBA All Star Ben Simmons remains the highest-paid Australian athlete in the world, while no women featured in the top 100.\n\n\"[But] the pathway to the top for elite female athletes is slightly narrower, steeper, and fundamentally more treacherous than it is for male athletes.\"\n\nDr Dickson said government grants and funding were generally unavailable to professional boxers like Kenneally, as they were reserved for amateurs who had a pathway to the Olympic Games.\n\n\"She's to be commended for what she's doing. She's getting towards the pointy end of her sport,\" he said.\n\n\" But she's occupying this very awkward zone where the money doesn't necessarily equate to her sporting capabilities. \"\n\nKenneally said she recognised the path of a professional female boxer was always going to be difficult, but working full time to make ends meet for her and her daughter made it even more so.\n\nKenneally works full time to make ends meet for her and her daughter. (Supplied: Che Kenneally)\n\n\"Being an athlete is hard \u2026 but I've chosen to be an athlete and I've chosen to have a baby, so I've put the pressure on myself,\" she said.\n\n\"I want to be a great athlete, and to be that I need to put the time in, but there's only so many hours in the day and mine are pretty full up at the moment.\"\n\n'Powerful tenacity'\n\nGriffith University researcher and former Muay Thai fighter Erin Nichols said there was a long way to go before gender equality was achieved in combat sports such as boxing.\n\n\"Women's boxing is still building legitimacy, unfortunately, in the eyes of promoters and broadcasters, despite the evidence of growing fan interest,\" Dr Nichols said.\n\n\" While male fighters benefit from a legacy system of investment, female fighters are often expected to prove their commercial worth before receiving support. \"\n\nErin Nichols trained as a Muay Thai fighter and is now a Griffith University researcher. (Supplied: Erin Nichols)\n\nDr Nichols said Kenneally's fight outside the ring to raise the required funds was \"emblematic of the wider landscape\" female athletes operated in.\n\n\"Her story is a powerful example of the tenacity [and] the leadership that so many women athletes bring to their sport,\" she said.\n\n\"Her willingness to fundraise publicly to maintain her title defence and speak openly about the barriers she faces makes it not just a personal triumph, it's a form of advocacy.\"",

Here are the quick hits from the World Test Championship final.\n\nBefore the first day of the final, only one other Test player in the storied 141-year history of the longer format at Lord's had appeared on both boards, after legendary West Indies opener Gordon Greenidge scored tons for the Windies in 1984 and 1988, while also notching 122 for Rest of the World in 1987, when that team was playing out of the MCC dressing rooms.\n\nA piece of sticky batting tape with Rabada's name written on it in pen has been attached to the board for his figures of 5-51, as is the tradition for players during matches. The gold lettering should soon follow.\n\n\"It was cool to have it in the home changing room now,\" said Rabada, whose name is on the board in the away dressing room for the 5-52 he took for his country in a Test against England in 2022.\n\nThe 30-year-old fast bowler had come into the match with something of a cloud hanging over him having recently served a short ban for recreational drug use.\n\n\"It wasn't my best moment, as I have alluded to,\" Rabada said, in a matter-of-fact manner.\n\n\"Life moves on.

And I think I have been a consistent player over a 25-year career.\n\n\"I could probably pick three troughs where my game was looking pretty ordinary and I fell outside the top 50 and I was really struggling.

(ABC News: James Carmody)\n\nAnd Perth fell 7,700 rental homes short of keeping pace with population growth from March 2023 to the end of 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, housing build times have blown out to 15.6 months, from seven months in 2018-19.\n\nDeepening inequality\n\nProfessor Duncan said the lack of housing was pushing people to the outskirts of the city, to areas that lacked public transport and essential services.\n\n\"There's a shift away from rental opportunities in inner Perth and far more towards the outer suburbs, further away from amenity, further away from jobs,\" he said.\n\nSome growing outer areas like Ellenbrook have received transport upgrades but remain isolated from services. (ABC News: Gian De Poloni)\n\nProfessor Duncan said the housing crisis was reshaping the social map of the state.\n\n\"In order to find affordable rental housing, [low income households] will need to travel progressively further and further away from the centre of Perth, and that's one of the things that's really pushing inequality in the state,\" he said.\n\nWA rental crisis reaches new depths Photo shows Two people, Darcy and Caitlin, sit outside a home with Caitlin holding a mug. Not a single property or room is affordable for people on Jobseeker, Youth Allowance or the Disability Support Pension in WA, an Anglicare report finds.\n\n\"We are witnessing a breakdown in the ability of WA's housing system to meet the needs of ordinary West Australians.\"\n\n\"There's an awful long way to go before the housing system gets anywhere near back to balance.\"\n\nHousing solutions\n\nBut the report also outlines a range of measures its authors believe could provide immediate, medium and long-term relief to struggling households.\n\nQuick fixes include expanding rent assistance programs, reinstating and improving crisis and transitional accommodation and boosting support for homelessness support services.\n\nThe report has highlighted the scale of WA's housing crisis. (Supplied: Carballo)\n\nIn the medium term, the report recommends fast-tracking housing completions by increasing subsidies, streamlining approvals and mobilising the construction workforce, as well as targeting groups such as first home buyers and key workers for extra support.\n\nLonger-term solutions include more ambitious housing targets \u2014 at least 1,200 new social housing dwellings a year \u2014 along with axing stamp duty in favour of a \"more efficient\" tax that encourages mobility and unlocking more public land for development.",

(AAP: James Ross)\n\nMike Soccio, who describes himself as a member of the public but had been a member of the Greens, Labor and the Reason Party in the past, has since lodged a complaint about the matter with the Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission (IBAC).\n\nMr Soccio sent notification of the referral to Ms Deeming and party leader Brad Battin.\n\nHe alleged Ms Deeming made financial inducements to guarantee preselection and requested IBAC conduct a thorough investigation into whether any rules or election laws were broken and whether her actions constituted \"corrupt conduct by an elected parliamentarian\".\n\nHe said he was not a member of the Liberal Party and was not involved in the dispute in any way.\n\n\"I simply followed the lead of the [National Anti-Corruption Commission] in that it allows members of the public to make complaints,\" he said.\n\nJohn Pesutto is still to find the $2.3 million to pay the legal costs from Moira Deeming's successful defamation case. (ABC News: ABC News)\n\nIBAC said it does not comment about complaints or investigations \"as a matter of practice\".\n\nThe ABC has contacted Ms Deeming regarding the IBAC referral.\n\nMr Pesutto and the party yesterday rejected Ms Deeming's offer.\n\nHe instead is continuing to ask the Liberal Party for a loan. The party's administrative committee will meet on Thursday next week to discuss the request, approval of which would help it avoid a by-election in Mr Pesutto's electorate.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Ms Deeming sent a letter to colleagues.\n\n\"I am sad that my latest attempts to settle this matter in the best interests of all parties, including the Liberal Party \u2014 were not successful,\" she said.\n\n\" However, my conscience is clear; I did my very best to try and turn our collective focus away from internal matters and onto the injustices continually inflicted on Victorians by the Labor Government. \"\n\nFormer premier likens Deeming proposal to blackmail\n\nFormer Liberal premier Jeff Kennett described Ms Deeming's proposal as \"most unusual\", disappointing and amateurish.\n\n\"For her to be saying that, in fact, the party should be guaranteeing her preselection shows that she clearly doesn't understand how the party works,\" Mr Kennett told ABC Radio Melbourne.\n\nHe said he felt like the party was being blackmailed.\n\n\"I really felt she has been terribly, badly advised so, to some degree, I feel very sorry for her,\" he said.\n\nMr Kennett said the Liberal Party was still working on raising the funds to help Mr Pesutto.\n\n\"The Liberal Party should never, ever contemplate throwing one of its own under a bus and, second, we've always got to do what's in the best interests of, in this case, the state and the party.\"\n\nHe warned the party needed to settle its internal divisions before next year's election.\n\nFormer premier Jeff Kennett urged the Liberal Party to settle the tensions between Moira Deeming and John Pesutto before the next election. (Facebook)\n\nGeoffrey Watson SC, a former political adviser and now director of The Centre for Public Integrity, described Ms Deeming's proposal as \"a shocker\" and said it would undermine public confidence.\n\n\"If somebody were to say well I've achieved preselection for a particular seat in parliament and the endorsement of a particular party on the basis I was owed money and I've foregone a debt to get it, that's not right, that's not how it works,\" he said.",

        "text": "The Australian Private Hospitals Association (APHA) has asked the question \u2014 when is a ministerial deadline and election commitment neither a deadline nor a commitment?\n\nEarlier this year, the federal Health Minister Mark Butler, via The Australian, reportedly put the health insurance industry on notice \u201cto take action on payments to private hospitals within the next three months, directing they increase funding to a greater proportion of benefits\u201d.\n\nThen, just over a month later, he doubled down at the AFR Health Summit, saying: \u201cThere is no question there\u2019s been a structural shift of where the money is going in the system and there is a structural shift downwards for private hospitals. There has been a shift up in profitability and management expenses of insurers. Which is why I\u2019ve said I think there needs to be a lift in the benefits payments ratio from insurers to hospitals. I want them working on that urgently.\u201d\n\nBut yesterday, in an interview with ABC Radio Brisbane\u2019s Ellen Fanning, he appears to have walked away from his own deadline.\n\nHe told Fanning: \u201cWe want to see very clear evidence of what has happened since I put that challenge to them (the insurers) a couple of months ago, and what is going to happen over coming months. And if it's not satisfactory to me, if it doesn't give me confidence that it's going to underpin a strong viability of the private hospital sector going forward, as I said, I will take action.\u201d\n\nAHPA are now asking: \"Just how many more months do the insurers have before the Minister will act? Three months ago private hospitals on the brink of collapse put a lot of faith in the Minister\u2019s word that he would act, as promised, 'within three months,'\" APHA CEO Brett Heffernan said.\n\n\"The Minister\u2019s deadline has lapsed. Now that commitment appears to have been fudged and pushed out further, with private hospitals desperate to keep their doors open back in no-man\u2019s land and left scratching their heads. Like the Minister\u2019s failed Private Hospital Viability Health Check process, that faith, once again, seems to have been misplaced. \"Private hospitals welcomed the Federal Government\u2019s pre-election and election campaign pledges recognising the runaway profits and growing management fees of health insurers, while benefits to private hospitals have failed to keep pace with costs.\"\n\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) data shows the shortfall in funding to private hospitals from insurers in 2022 was $660 million.\n\nIn 2023 this blew out to $1.135 billion and to $1.254 billion last year.",

        "text": "Mollie O'Callaghan was the darling of Australia during last year's Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nShe had beaten Australia's swimming queen Ariarne Titmus in her world record event, the 200m freestyle, one of three golds O'Callaghan won during the Games.\n\nHowever, things have not gone as planned since then.\n\nO'Callaghan freely admits she has struggled this year both in and out of the pool with injuries and other demons.\n\nShe is still the fastest woman in Australia over 200m, proving that on night three of the Australian Swimming Trials with a strong win that included her customary kick over the final 50.\n\nBut her time of 1 minute 54.43 seconds was more than 1.5 seconds slower than her personal best \u2014 the world record she held before Titmus took it.\n\nWhile it was her fastest time of the year, she was still disappointed.\n\n\"I was a bit off today,\" she said on Wednesday night in Adelaide.\n\n\"You know you get a bit anxious like everyone does, and I think I was just overthinking it.\n\n\"I'm trying too hard not to think about the time, it's all about racing at the moment.\n\n\"I think after the lead-up I've had over the past few months, to come back off a big break and injury and other little bits and bobs and personal stuff, I think I'm pretty proud of myself to show up behind the blocks and do that two-hundred.\"\n\nO'Callaghan said she was working on ways to find enjoyment in swimming after the high of the Paris Olympics, following the inevitable comedown after winning three gold medals.\n\nMcKeown off to world titles despite DQ Photo shows An Australian swimmer arches her back as she dives into the water in a backstroke race. Kaylee McKeown beat rival Mollie O'Callaghan in the race of the night at the Australian Swimming Trials, but she acknowledges she is still not at her best after struggling since the Paris Olympics.\n\n\"After the Olympics I'd achieved everything I wanted to, and I needed that mental recovery after that,\" she said.\n\n\"This year's about having fun, but there's been a lot of curveballs thrown at me, so it's making it very hard to have fun.\n\n\"But I think making the team and having the pressure taken off, just to race and go meet new people, go have fun and train alongside my buddies overseas, which is the whole purpose of this.\"\n\nIt has led O'Callaghan to ponder how she can balance having fun while being in a highly competitive environment, trying to qualify for the World Aquatics Championships.\n\n\"That's something I'm still learning,\" said O'Callaghan, who earlier in the meet revealed she didn't have any friends outside of swimming.\n\n\"At 21 years old, you're forever learning that.\n\n\"You know we've been in this sport for a very long time when you get stuck down and you have to be so dedicated to each and every little thing where it's like you don't have a life outside of it.\n\n\"This part is about discovering who I am outside of the pool.\n\n\"But a part of me is trying to force myself to get back into the rhythm. But I think incredible people like Lani (Pallister) and Kaylee (McKeown) make it a lot more fun.\n\n\"You know I put a lot of pressure on myself but externally a lot of people expect a lot out of me, but they don't really see the work that goes behind it or what I've been through.\"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nO'Callaghan's introspection and dissatisfaction mirror that of backstroke star Kaylee McKeown, who has won both the 50m and 100m backstroke events at these trials, but has been extremely disappointed with her times.\n\n\"Mollie is so hard on herself,\" said Pallister, who finished second in the 200m freestyle final with a personal best time.\n\n\"When she comes and stands here and talks about, I guess wanting the world record back, and wanting to be a 1:52, there's two people who have ever done that, and that's her and Ariarne.\n\n\"So, as much as she says that it wasn't a good swim, she's just incredible with what she does and what she can do.\"\n\nPallister, who won a gold medal in Paris as part of Australia's 4x200m freestyle relay team, said O'Callaghan's struggles are a reflection of the pressures Australian swimmers face.\n\n\"This is going to sound really brutal, but I think sometimes people forget that these athletes are also people,\" Pallister said.\n\n\"There's so much expectation put on Australian swimmers, and I think that shows.\n\n\"Every four years we're expected to win multiple gold medals, and sometimes, if you don't race at your best, I guess it's almost [the] public and other people that bring you down.\n\n\"But I think if you have a supportive group around you, it doesn't really matter what the rest of the world says,\" Pallister said.\n\nCameron McEvoy said he also experienced the same comedown after winning gold in the men's 50m freestyle in Paris.\n\n\"I definitely went through a pretty tough period,\" he said.\n\n\"You go from your world being extremely tiny, where it's just swim, sleep, eat, and that's it.\n\n\"And as soon as you touch the wall, it gets flipped upside down, and you've got the entire world trying to talk to you, and kind of the world opens up, and you're not swimming as much, and then you've got to come down emotionally.\"\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nBut the 31-year-old has 10 years more life experience than O'Callaghan, is now married and expecting his first baby.\n\n\"Now digesting the marriage, digesting starting a family, that kind of put the whole swimming gig into comparison and it humbles the whole job here \u2014 makes me realise there's so much more to the world,\" he said.\n\nUnlike O'Callaghan, the physics and mathematics graduate was happy with his winning time in the men's 50m freestyle of 21.3 seconds \u2014 the fastest time in the world this year.\n\nMcEvoy said he is swimming so well and consistently that even an average performance is enough to win at these trials, and there's more to come.\n\n\"I definitely think I can go faster before the world champs,\" he said.\n\n\"How much more, I'm not sure, but longer term \u2014 more LA (Olympics) levels to the future, I think yeah, there's a lot more I can improve upon.\"\n\nTeenage breaststroker Sienna Toohey followed up her 100m success by winning the 50m women's breaststroke final, but could not make the qualifying time for the World Championships.\n\n\"I'm honestly very happy with it, the qualifying time is extremely tough,\" she said.\n\n\"Last night was a good swim, got the qualifying time, hopefully they might put me in the 50 over in the worlds, maybe, who knows?\"\n\nToohey said she was prepared for the hype that followed her extraordinary swim on Tuesday night.\n\n\"I knew that it was going to blow up like that. I saw a bit of popping up and then I was like, 'Well I can't get too full of myself,' so I put my phone on do not disturb and I haven't really been on it since then,\" she said.\n\nSam Short continued his stunning form, taking out the men's 800m freestyle final in 7:40.95, to go with his win in the 400m and second place in the 200m.\n\n\"It's going to be a battle in Singapore like it always is, we're like in a golden age of distance swimming at the moment,\" Short said.\n\n\"I love racing, it's just so much fun, I love getting in there hurting, that's why I do it.\"\n\nIn other results, Paralympic gold medallist Benjamin Hance set the fastest time in history in the S14 men's 50m backstroke event.\n\nHis time of 26.09 seconds was recognised by VIRTUS Sport as a world record, but not an official world record as the event isn't raced at the Paralympics or Para World Championships.",

        "text": "The March surge has been attributed to \u201cfront-loading,\u201d or importers rushing to build their inventories before the broader Trump tariffs, announced on April 2, which Trump labelled \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d could take effect. The existence of those inflated stocks means the impact of the tariffs on prices for consumers would take some time to filter through to inflation data. There\u2019s also a sense from the anecdotal evidence that companies are waiting for the dust to settle and a clearer picture of the final tariff settings to emerge before acting. Fed chair Jerome Powell. The central bank will want to wait until the full picture of the tariffs and the effect they have on the inflation numbers is fully reflected before cutting rates. Credit: AP The Fed\u2019s \u201cBeige Book\u201d \u2013 a compilation of surveys undertaken by the 12 regional Fed banks, said last week that there had been \u201cwidespread\u201d reports from companies that they expected costs and prices to rise at a faster rate, with some of the districts reporting that those survey expected the cost increases to be \u201cstrong, significant or substantial.\u201d All the district reports, the Fed said, indicated that higher tariff rates were putting upward pressure on costs and prices and that the companies that planned to pass through tariff-related costs to customers expected to do so within three months.\n\nThat fits with what consumer-facing companies have been saying in their investor presentations and makes sense. They are saying that the tariffs are too material to be absorbed and will be passed on. Loading Allowing for the buffer provided by the front-loading of imports in March, the question mark over what will happen when the pause on the reciprocal tariffs ends and a reluctance of companies to increase prices and lose sales until they actually experience cost increases that they expect to persist, the impact of the tariffs could be expected to show up progressively over the rest of the year. Data over the next three to six months will better reflect the impacts of the tariffs. Nevertheless, there were some early indications that the effects of Trump\u2019s earliest tariffs are showing up.\n\nThe prices of major appliances, for instance, jumped nearly 4.5 per cent last month. They were included in Trump\u2019s February tariff announcements. The prices of perishables like bananas and vegetables, where supply can\u2019t be front-loaded, rose significantly, as did toys, a segment China dominates. The price hikes in those categories were offset by a decline in the prices of new cars, a segment where the tariffs are expected to eventually have a substantial impact, eggs, gasoline and air fares. US oil prices have fallen more than 15 per cent this year amid a global glut of oil. West Texas Intermediate prices bottomed out around $US60 a barrel in May and are now trading around $US68 a barrel. Data over the next three to six months will better reflect the impacts of the tariffs on the US economy. Credit: Bloomberg The drop in airfares, which reflects a slump in demand, may have something to do with Trump\u2019s immigration policies and the harsh treatment of visitors to the US by US Customs and Border Protection personnel.\n\nWhile the May data might appear benign, it is improbable that the Fed will heed Trump\u2019s call for a percentage point cut to the federal funds rate when its Open Market Committee meets next week. The markets are assigning zero probability to a cut, although the odds on one in September improved from 60 per cent to 70 per cent after the inflation data was released. The Fed will want to wait until the full picture of the tariffs and the effect they have on the inflation numbers is fully reflected. It will also want to understand the dynamic between the tariffs\u2019 impacts on prices and their impacts on the underlying economy. It is conceivable that the tariffs, the likely price increases associated with them and the uncertainty generated by the way they have been announced \u2013 they\u2019ve evolved unpredictably and appear dependent on Trump\u2019s volatile moods \u2013 will lead to materially lower US economic growth, which would reduce demand and blunt the inflationary impact of the tariffs. It\u2019s also conceivable that the outcome could be shrinking growth and spiking inflation \u2013 stagflation \u2013 which would force the Fed to choose between combatting inflation or saving jobs. That\u2019s why the safest course for the Fed at this point is to sit on its hands until it has more useful data.\n\nTrump, of course, has always advocated for lower interest rates and has routinely verbally assaulted the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, for not delivering them. He needs them more than ever, with the Congressional Budget Office saying his \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d \u2013 his budget bill \u2013 would add $US3 trillion to US government debt over the next decade if enacted in its current form. Trump, on his Truth Social platform, in posting his plea for the Fed to cut rates, added that the US \u201cWOULD PAY MUCH LESS INTEREST ON DEBT COMING DUE. SO IMPORTANT!!!.\u201d The Republicans are tearing themselves apart \u2013 fiscal conservatives versus the Trumpists \u2013 in negotiations over the bill. Lower debt-servicing costs would help his cause. It doesn\u2019t seem to have occurred to Trump and his advisers that damaging the credibility of Powell and the Fed would be damaging to the US economy and markets and would be more likely to increase the perceived risk of investing in the US. The likelihood that the Fed will wait until at least September, if not later, before seriously contemplating a cut has led to new speculation that Trump will move to undermine Powell, reviving and refining a plan schemed up by Bessent during last year\u2019s election campaign. Powell, whose term as chair of the Fed (but not as a governor) expires in May next year, can\u2019t be removed by Trump. Bessent suggested that a \u201cshadow\u201d governor should be announced, one who would provide their own commentary on rates and inflation and, because they would be Powell\u2019s successor, increasingly undermine Powell and the Fed\u2019s credibility.",

        "text": "Abandoned by Wilson, Smile entered rock lore as a lost document of a brilliant but troubled mind. Mike Love, the Beach Boys vocalist and longtime foil of Wilson\u2019s, called it \u201ca whole album of Brian\u2019s madness\u201d. It remained unfinished for nearly 40 years. Wilson\u2019s life story came to be portrayed as a struggle to escape from the yokes of two men: his abusive father and a controlling psychotherapist, Eugene Landy. Landy\u2019s unorthodox methods were effective in nursing Wilson back to health during two periods of treatment in the 1970s and \u201980s. Yet Landy also went into business with his patient, sharing copyrights with Wilson and taking writing credits on some of his songs. Brian Wilson in 1965. Credit: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Landy eventually came under the scrutiny of Californian authorities and surrendered his licence. After an intervention by Wilson\u2019s family, a court order also blocked Landy from contact with Wilson. Wilson spoke openly about his struggles with mental illness, including his experience with schizoaffective disorder, a condition characterised by hallucinations and delusions. The condition led to the conservatorship granted to his business associates in early 2024.\n\nBrian Douglas Wilson was born June 20, 1942, in Inglewood, California, to Murry and Audree (Korthof) Wilson. His father was a heavy-machinery salesperson who had collected a handful of credits as a frustrated songwriter. His mother, a homemaker, kept the Beach Boys\u2019 books in the early days of the band. The family moved to Hawthorne, California, when Brian was a toddler, and had two more boys, Dennis and Carl. Loading By 1961, the three Wilson boys were playing rock music with Love, a cousin, and a schoolmate of Brian\u2019s, Al Jardine. Around that time, Dennis began surfing and delighted in the fashion, trendy lingo and carefree lifestyle that went along with it. One day he told Brian and Love, \u201cYou guys ought to write a song about surfing.\u201d\n\nThey did, and that fall, the group recorded its first song, Surfin\u2019. The young men called themselves the Pendletones, after a type of flannel shirt popular among surfers. When they received the finished record, released by a small local label, Candix, they discovered that they had been renamed the Beach Boys. Signed by Capitol Records in 1962, the group was prolific from the start, releasing 10 studio LPs through 1965. The Beach Boys in 1966 (from left): Al Jardine, Mike Love, Dennis Wilson, Brian Wilson and Carl Wilson. Credit: AP Wilson became the band\u2019s primary producer and songwriter, and his sophistication soon shone through. Surfer Girl, a lilting, harmony-drenched ballad that went to No. 7 in 1963, was perhaps the first pop hit written, arranged, produced and sung by the same person. Wilson\u2019s first No. 1, however, came as a writer of Jan and Dean\u2019s song Surf City (1963). In a sign of conflicts to come, Murry Wilson, who managed the Beach Boys and controlled the band\u2019s songwriting copyrights, was furious that Brian had given a valuable hit to another act.\n\nOther problems surfaced. Surfin\u2019 U.S.A. resembled Chuck Berry\u2019s Sweet Little Sixteen a bit too closely, so Berry\u2019s name was added to the credits, and his publisher acquired the song\u2019s copyright. In December 1964, Wilson married Marilyn Rovell, who sang in a girl group called the Honeys. A few weeks later, he had a panic attack on a flight to a Beach Boys engagement in Houston and decided to quit touring to concentrate on songwriting and recording. That same year, the group fired Murry Wilson as manager. As Brian Wilson would recount, his father had long tormented him. In one form of punishment, his father would remove his glass eye and force his son to stare into the empty socket. \u201cMy dad was violent,\u201d Wilson wrote in a 2016 memoir, I Am Brian Wilson, written with Ben Greenman. \u201cHe was cruel.\u201d\n\nFreed from his father\u2019s control and the Beach Boys\u2019 touring demands, Wilson immersed himself in the studio. Pet Sounds, released in May 1966, elevated the Beach Boys\u2019 music to a level far above anything they had created before. With the rest of the group on the road, Wilson made the album primarily with studio musicians. Upon release, the album stalled at No. 10, a relative dud by Beach Boys standards. By then, however, Wilson was working on his next gem: the single Good Vibrations. The beach Boys: (from left) Bruce Johnston, David Marks, rear, Brian Wilson, Mike Love and Al Jardine in New York in 2012. Credit: Jason Decrow/Invision/AP Spliced together from months of sessions across four studios, Good Vibrations was a catchy and sonically adventurous invocation of peppy West Coast spirituality. Released in October 1966, the song became an indelible radio hit, but it was Wilson\u2019s last moment at the vanguard of pop.\n\nWilson\u2019s drug use, which had begun during happier times for the band, had grown out of control, stunting his creativity. \u201cI lost interest in writing songs,\u201d Wilson once told Rolling Stone. For about a year, starting in 1975, he was treated by Landy, whose methods included dousing his patient with cold water in the morning. He also limited his patient\u2019s contact with others, including Wilson\u2019s family, to underscore the therapist\u2019s role as \u201cthe ultimate power in this situation,\u201d as Landy once put it. Wilson continued to perform as part of the Beach Boys, but his behaviour was erratic and his drug use continued. In 1982, the Beach Boys kicked Wilson out of the group, and he returned to the care of Landy. His treatment, begun in seclusion in Hawaii, included a strict diet and vitamin regimen, with Wilson under constant supervision. Landy\u2019s techniques raised eyebrows, but in Wilson\u2019s case they seemed effective. When the singer made the press rounds in 1988 for his first solo album, Brian Wilson, he appeared fit, energetic and focused. Brian Wilson, left, and his second wife Melinda Ledbetter Wilson at the 55th annual Grammy Awards in 2013. Credit: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP\n\nThe extent of Landy\u2019s control over his patient, and his involvement in Wilson\u2019s career, drew concern among Wilson\u2019s family and people in the music industry. The two men started a business partnership, called Brains and Genius, that allowed Landy to draw profits from Wilson\u2019s recordings, films and other ventures. Landy was the executive producer of Brian Wilson, and he and his girlfriend, Alexandra Morgan, shared songwriting credits with Wilson on some tracks. Wilson said he even modified his will to make Landy its primary beneficiary. After an investigation by California authorities into his treatment of Wilson and other patients, Landy surrendered his license in 1989, though he continued to work with Wilson through their partnership. Members of Wilson\u2019s family filed a conservatorship case over Wilson\u2019s care. In 1992, as a result of a settlement in that case, Landy was barred by court order from making any contact with Wilson; his name and that of Morgan, whom he later married, were removed from song credits. Landy died in 2006 at 71. In 1995, Wilson married Melinda Ledbetter, a former model who worked at a car dealership and had sold him a Cadillac. He frequently credited her with helping him rebuild his life after his entanglement with Landy. She died in 2024. \u201cMelinda was more than my wife,\u201d Wilson said at the time. \u201cShe was my saviour. She gave me the emotional security I needed to have a career. She encouraged me to make the music that was closest to my heart. She was my anchor.\u201d",

        "text": "\u201cIt is natural that the administration would want to examine this major undertaking including progress and delivery, just as the UK government recently concluded an AUKUS review and reaffirmed its support. \u201cOur engagement with the Trump Administration and across the full political spectrum in the United States has shown clear and consistent support for AUKUS.\u201d The US Defence Department is reviewing AUKUS to see whether it aligns with President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d priorities. Credit: AP \u201cImportantly, AUKUS will grow both US and Australian defence industry as well as generating thousands of new manufacturing jobs,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Australia is investing $US3 billion ($4.6 billion) in US shipyards as part of the deal.\n\nOpposition frontbencher Bridget McKenzie said AUKUS was critical for Australia\u2019s defence. \u201c[The review is] a deeply concerning development,\u201d she said on Channel Nine\u2019s Today show. \u201cThere\u2019s now a growing list of serious issues and tasks for the prime minister with his meeting with President Trump next week. Any undermining of this serious and substantial alliance between our two countries should be of grave concern\u201d. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who has been critical of AUKUS, questioned why Australia has not yet reviewed the scheme. \u201cThe UK is conducting a review of AUKUS. The US... is conducting a review of AUKUS,\u201d he said on X. \u201cBut Australia, which has the most at stake, has no review. Our parliament to date has been the least curious and least informed. Time to wake up?\u201d\n\nColby has previously called himself an AUKUS sceptic and last year said it would be \u201ccrazy\u201d if the arrangement resulted in nuclear-powered submarines going to the wrong places at the wrong time. Of particular concern is the US\u2019s lagging rates of submarine production, and failure to meet its own needs. As part of the AUKUS deal, the president of the day can refuse to release the boat to Australia if it is required for American defence priorities. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth while meeting with his Australian counterpart Richard Marles earlier this year. Credit: AP However, Colby expressed more optimism about AUKUS at his confirmation hearing earlier this year, saying he wanted to remove red tape and barriers to submarine production so that the partnership could be expedited. News of the review comes just days before Prime Minister Anthony Albanese expects to meet Trump on the sidelines of the G7 world leaders\u2019 summit in Canada. But on Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president\u2019s schedule for those G7 meetings was still being finalised.\n\nAlbanese\u2019s office has been contacted for comment, as was Australia\u2019s embassy in Washington, which referred questions to Canberra. At a meeting with Defence Minister Richard Marles at the start of this month, Hegseth urged Australia to lift defence spending to 3.5 per cent of GDP \u2013 a request reiterated by Colby on social media this week. Loading A UK government spokesperson said AUKUS was \u201cone of the most strategically important partnerships in decades\u201d. \u201cIt is understandable that a new administration would want to review its approach to such a major partnership, just as the UK did last year,\u201d they said. \u201cThe UK will continue to work closely with the US and Australia at all levels to maximise the benefits and opportunities which AUKUS presents for our three nations.\u201d\n\nSeveral AUKUS experts urged caution in interpreting the intent of the US review. They pointed to the fact the United Kingdom recently commenced a parliamentary inquiry into the pact, and said it was natural that the Trump administration would seek to ensure AUKUS aligned with its own priorities. The review also comes just weeks after the new US ambassador to Britain, Republican donor Warren Stephens, told a London audience that AUKUS was \u201cvital\u201d to global peace and security. Under the first pillar of the pact, Australia will purchase three to five nuclear-powered submarines from the US, starting in the 2030s, and build more through a joint initiative with the US and UK. Under the second pillar, the three nations will collaborate on advanced defence technologies. Australia is also contributing at least $US3 billion ($4.6 billion) to the US defence industrial base to shore up submarine production; $800 million has already been paid. The deal was announced in 2021 under then prime minister Scott Morrison and then US president Joe Biden. Loading\n\nSophia Gaston, UK foreign policy lead at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in London, said the British inquiry had \u201cinjected new dynamism and political edge into the UK\u2019s approach\u201d, which was helpful in taking AUKUS forward under Trump. She said it was perfectly reasonable for the new administration to conduct a review into a project as large and significant as AUKUS. \u201cWe can never be certain of where another government\u2019s review will take them, but Britain and Australia must be confident in the rationale behind AUKUS and its alignment with America\u2019s core goals of deterrence and competition towards China,\u201d Gaston said. \u201cThe best thing both allies can do during this review process is to put themselves in a posture ready to deliver some quick wins, particularly on pillar two, which will demonstrate the value in America partnering with allies to amplify its strengths in both scale and innovation.\u201d Alessio Patalano, a professor of war and strategy in East Asia at King\u2019s College London, said Colby\u2019s views on AUKUS before he joined the current administration would likely inform how AUKUS advocates perceived this review.\n\n\u201cHowever, these views are now being channelled into a government effort to \u2018audit\u2019 how AUKUS advances the US economy and security,\u201d he said. \u201cAs such, the review represents an opportunity to assess whether the current governance structure and priorities would benefit from greater focus.\u201d Supporters argue the pact is a strategic bulwark in an increasingly contested Indo-Pacific region, though critics warn that delays and shifting political dynamics could undermine its success. But British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer last month declared the AUKUS defence pact the centrepiece of his government\u2019s national security strategy, promising the UK\u2019s largest military investment since the Cold War. At a high-level event in Westminster, Starmer described AUKUS as a \u201cnational endeavour\u201d and named former national security adviser Sir Stephen Lovegrove as his special representative to lead the project.",

Radhika Mudaliyar and Nadie Kammallaweera play Isha and Nirmala in The Wrong Gods. Credit: Brett Boardman These concerns find their apotheosis in the increasingly frayed relationship between Isha (Radhika Mudaliyar) and her mother Nirmala (Nadie Kammallaweera). Isha dreams of a life beyond the confines of her riverside village and finding a different truth, but is stultified by her mother\u2019s reticence to change. Nirmala is staunch and steadfast in her desire to live and die by her land, dictated by the caprices of the climate and environment. Enter Lakshmi (Vaishnavi Suryaprakash), a cog in a multinational company who Nirmala calls \u201cthe devil\u201d. Simultaneously introducing Nirmala to newfangled farming technology and financial arrangements while offering Isha the freedom to realise her dreams of becoming a scientist, Lakshmi promises a form of liberation to both women. What could go wrong?\n\nThe Wrong Gods takes its inspiration from India\u2019s \u201cgreatest planned environmental disaster\u201d, where one of the world\u2019s biggest hydropower infrastructure projects involved damming the Narmada River, a life source for millions, leading to displacement of indigenous communities and severe ecological catastrophe. Catapulting us seven years into the future in its second act, we see Nirmala protesting the ever-encroaching threat of irresponsible development on her land, aided by Devi (Manali Datar), while Isha pursues her dreams in the city.

Much of the exposition occurs in the dense dialogue that\u2019s exchanged between all four characters.

You can support Isha\u2019s desire to live a self-determined life, while wanting this same autonomy to be extended to her mother. You can wish for an easier life for Nirmala, while rejecting the ways colonial powers and corrupt state governments extract and exploit. At times, The Wrong Gods is both oversimplified and overexplained \u2013 much of the exposition occurs in the dense dialogue that\u2019s exchanged between all four characters. They flit from idea to idea at lightning speed, from the patriarchy of god worship to the overconsumption of cities that sees rural denizens as collateral damage.\n\nBut the heightened emotional stakes of the personal relationships at the play\u2019s fulcrum anchor it. Each character undergoes a metamorphosis of sorts as their perspectives and perception in the eyes of the others shift. Under Shakthidharan and Hannah Goodwin\u2019s direction, they pace around and across the deep concentric grooves of tree rings, stuck in a cycle that was imposed on them as they look for ways to resist and defy it. Loading Kammallaweera is a highlight as the exceedingly strong Nirmala, providing comedic relief even as she wrenches the rug from beneath us in an emotionally stirring performance (special mention to her machete skills). Suryaprakash keeps us guessing as to Lakshmi\u2019s motives in a stunning interplay of opacity and sincerity. Compressed into a neat 90 minutes, The Wrong Gods is significantly shorter than Counting and Cracking, but shares its deep engagement with big ideas that traverse the personal and the political.

Joe Paradise Lui and Merlynn Tong in a scene from Legends (of the Golden Arches). Credit: Jessica Wyld Merlynn Tong and Joe Paradise Lui saunter onto the stage as themselves. They\u2019re super low-key about it, and as their banter moves between shared nostalgia for, and shit-talking about, the childhoods they\u2019ve left behind, conflict emerges. It emerges that both Lui and Tong have lost older relatives with a taste for McDonald\u2019s burgers \u2013 one was a Filet-O-Fish connoisseur, the other a Big Mac fiend \u2013 and the immediate reason for their being onstage together is the aftermath of a funeral for one of these \u2013 Lui\u2019s grandfather, for whom Tong insists on observing Chinese funerary traditions. She wants to fold and burn joss paper (as underworld currency, so the deceased can bribe their way past the many lords and officials in Chinese hell) and stay up all night, lest the dead ancestor remain trapped as a hungry ghost.\n\nMourning doesn\u2019t become Joe Paradise Lui, though. He hired strippers for the funeral and has long outgrown superstitions he now finds anathema to his firmly anti-capitalist, pacifist ethos. Whether his contempt is (at least partly) a psychological defence against loss \u2013 Lui chose an artistic career and permanent exile in Australia over compulsory military service in Singapore \u2013 is a question he\u2019ll have an eternity to confront. Legends (of the Golden Arches) draws the audience into hilarious and heartfelt odyssey. Credit: Jessica Wyld In a moment of pique, Lui throws a bag of Mickey D\u2019s on the offering pyre. The act of disrespect opens a portal to a terrifying, and distinctly Chinese, hell dimension. There\u2019s a flamboyant reveal, supercharged by garish Getai performance in futuristic costume, before all hell does break loose.\n\nLoading Set designer Cherish Marrington brings the guardians of the underworld to carnivalesque life through custom-made inflatables, and the performers can only escape the funfair atmosphere after Guanyin \u2013 goddess of mercy in the Chinese pantheon \u2013 intervenes. Visually splendid video artistry from Wendy Yu illustrates the retelling of Chinese legends in this work, from the backstory of the Chinese god of war, Guan Yu, to tales of the underworld\u2019s incorruptible judge, Bao Gong. Unfortunately, the script isn\u2019t always as vibrant or effective as the design \u2013 some jokes fall flat, and some of the cultural commentary is so basic it feels patronising. When Legends (of the Golden Arches) succeeds, though, it draws the audience into a hilarious and heartfelt odyssey \u2013 one that balances respect for the living and the dead, while navigating the mystery and majesty (and absurdity) of cultural traditions ancient and modern.

Her songs promise, and mostly deliver, a good time. And her Lifetimes concert does the same, across two and a half hours, five acts, multiple costume changes and more than 20 songs from a back catalogue stretching to 2008 (the pre-Perry Christian singer Katy Hudson gets a brief acknowledgement but no stage time). Katy Perry on stage at Rod Laver Arena. Credit: Martin Philbey But this big, spectacular, noisy and surprisingly intimate show also has grander ambitions, in which it has mixed success. It\u2019s all there in the framing device: a video game in which KP143, an \u201cenhanced\u201d version of Katy Perry, attempts to unseat Mainframe, the AI that has come to rule humanity rather than serve it. To do so, she must free the butterflies that have been captured to power the AI, and to do that she needs to collect love, in the form of glowing hearts that descend from the arena rafters.\n\nThe 143, of course, refers to the title of her latest and much-criticised album, and is tech speak for \u201cI love you\u201d (with its origins in pager messaging from the 1990s). Phew. That\u2019s a lot of freight to load onto the shoulders of a bunch of pop songs, even a set as hook-heavy as Perry\u2019s. And at times, the strain shows. Perry and her team of 10 dancers work their collective butts off. Credit: Martin Philbey The stage is set in what looks like a figure eight, though it\u2019s actually the infinity symbol; later on, while singing E.T., a lightsaber-wielding Perry does battle with a lengthy bit of heating duct that is meant to represent the \u201cinfinite worm\u201d spewed out by Mainframe. It\u2019s the weakest moment in a show that has plenty of goof and lots of camp and heaps of flying on wires, and mostly manages to deploy them to great effect. The backdrop is a wall of screens, suggestive of the importance of video to Perry\u2019s success, but also integral to the narrative; it\u2019s up here, in lengthy clips, that the framing story unfolds, while Perry is offstage changing costumes.\n\nThe four-piece band \u2013 women on guitar and keys, men on bass and drums \u2013 play beneath the screen, while Perry and her 10 dancers make full use of the elongated stage. \u201cNot a bad seat in the house,\u201d she boasts. If \u201clove\u201d is the connective tissue here \u2013 and suddenly, her bizarre proclamation upon returning to Earth after that ill-conceived Bezos-shilling space flight makes so much promotional sense \u2013 the main theme is self-actualisation. The video screen backdrop plays a crucial role in the show\u2019s narrative. Credit: Wolter Peeters In the dubiously conceived segment where the audience gets to \u201crequest\u201d songs via QR code (it sent me to a sign-up page for the tour, with no option to vote), she plucked an 11-year-old to join her onstage while she sang Thinking of You, from her 2008 album One of The Boys. Maddie from Traralgon said she\u2019d had a dream about this moment; Katy from California says keep dreaming because as this moment proves, if you dream it you can be it. The singer\u2019s continual reinvention of herself is proof of that maxim. And her performance of the ballad \u2013 playing acoustic guitar, with no backing track and nowhere to hide \u2013 was proof that beneath all the razzle-dazzle she remains a serious talent. As she says towards the end, \u201cNever forget you are the main character of your video game\u201d.\n\nThe 143 album got a cold shoulder from critics and the charts, but its songs were loudly cheered and sounded great \u2013 Woman\u2019s World and Lifetimes especially. Once the dust settles, these will, I suspect, come to be considered bona fide bangers to rank alongside Hot and Cold, Roar, California Girls and the rest (all of which got an airing, naturally). Whenever she is onstage, Perry works her butt off. Running, jumping (at the end of Act One, she literally leaps into a pit and disappears), standing atop a tall pillar, dangling upside down in a spherical cage, flying high on the back of a giant butterfly. It\u2019s spectacular, and for the most part she sings well, looks great, and appears to be having almost as much fun as her audience (a spread of ages, including many young girls, with their mums, first-wave Perry fans who\u2019ve passed the baton of sparkly empowerment on). Katy Perry is a consummate performer. Credit: Martin Philbey Perry can be a little tone-deaf at times \u2013 her Blue Origin flight reeked of privilege, and working with producer Dr Luke was problematic at the least \u2013 but so much of the recent criticism of her smacks of ageism. She knows it, too. When she finished a terrific rendition of Teenage Dream, she responded to a call from a fan. \u201cOh still? I can be your hall pass still? I\u2019m 40 years old. Forty and fabulous.\u201d That she is.\n\nReviewed by Karl Quinn\n\nMUSIC | Rising festival\n\nPete and Bas \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nMax Watts, June 8 Peter Bowditch and Basil Bellgrave take the stage at the packed Max Watts a little early. They\u2019re men in their 70s and they talk (and dress) like they\u2019re in a Guy Ritchie film. Pete and Bas perform at Max Watts on June 8. Credit: Mandy Wu \u201cAre you ready for some madness?\u201d says Bas, in a broad cockney accent. \u201cWe ain\u2019t here for a laugh! This is serious\u201d says Pete. The DJ fills the room with reverberating rap airhorn and they launch into a drill track called Do One. I\u2019m in.\n\nSo are they actors? An elaborate bit of performance art? A septuagenerian Milli Vanilli? Did they have ties to notorious London gangsters the Kray brothers? Did Bas do a stint playing piano on cruise ships? I\u2019ve looked into all this. The answers are far less interesting than the questions. So maybe it\u2019s a joke. But the joke wouldn\u2019t land if they weren\u2019t actually great. Are Pete and Bas actors? An elaborate bit of performance art? Credit: Mandy Wu Their flow (on the recordings at least, more on that later) is fast, aggressive, razor sharp. And their lyrics are full of colour, character and flashes of violence. Sample: \u201cRecipes, batches, powders, waxes, cash in hand no taxes / Kerosene, matches, burn down factories, big boy tactics / Burning, burning, all this money I\u2019m earning.\u201d Like most rappers, they\u2019re entertainers, storytellers. Bas drags an excited young woman on stage.\u201cI f--ken love you c---s!\u201d she screams into the mic before twerking her way through the next track, Pint and a Fag.\n\nLoading The crowd are rowdy. Half a dozen people are hauled up to dance and occasionally rap. It is, as Bas puts it, \u201cgettin\u2019 a little bit lively\u201d. Pete throws a wad of cash into the crowd. Like the rest of the night, I can\u2019t quite tell if it\u2019s real or not. At 70-something, they do struggle to keep up with the flow. The backing tracks come complete with the recorded vocals as guides, and occasionally they lose track and mumble their way through a verse. It doesn\u2019t hinder the night as much as you might think. After about an hour ,they wrap up with Mr Worldwide (\u201cKeep one eye open for the plainclothes / I need more leg room for the plane home\u201d), and they\u2019re off. \u201cBack to our coffins,\u201d as Pete puts it. It\u2019s possible I\u2019ve just seen a couple of elderly actors fumble through a lip sync for an hour at the behest of a canny management company. I don\u2019t know!

Source: Getty / Michael Ochs Archives The band, known for their vocal harmonies, signed with Capitol Records in 1962 and released their first album, Surfin' Safari, that same year.\n\n\n\nMusic a safe haven for Wilson\n\nWilson was born on 20 June 1942 and began playing the piano and teaching his brothers to sing harmony at a young age.\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic was a haven of safety and joy for Wilson after an upbringing in which he suffered abuse from his domineering father, who would go on to manage the group.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Beach Boys started as a neighbourhood act, rehearsing in Wilson's bedroom and in the garage of their house in suburban Hawthorne, California.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilson played bass while his brother Dennis drummed and Carl played lead guitar. The band's work centred on Wilson's songwriting and arrangements.\n\n\n\nBrian Wilson performed regularly as a solo artist from 1999 to 2022. Source: Getty / Larry Hulst Their debut single, Surfin', became a minor hit upon its release in 1961 but was nothing compared with the success that followed from their second studio album, Surfin' USA, released in 1963.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe band's 1966 album Pet Sounds is considered by many to be their defining work \u2014 and is often cited as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilson's career would be derailed, though, as his drug use became untenable and his mental state, which would eventually be diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder with auditory hallucinations, grew shakier.\n\n\n\n\n\nSplitting from the band in the late 1990s, Wilson released several solo albums, including 2004's critically acclaimed Smile.\n\n\n\n\n\nWilson's brothers had both died by the time of the Beach Boys' 50th reunion tour in 2012, but he joined Love, who became the band's controlling force in its later years, for several shows\n\n\n\n\n\nThey were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 and received a Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award in 2001.\n\n\n\n",

Volunteers had sunscreen applied to a specific area of skin before a 'solar simulator' was applied to that area, as well as an unprotected area, as a control method.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter testing, Choice said it found only four products matched their SPF claims while 16 failed.\n\n\n\nSome of the products Choice said failed its test include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Aldi Ombra Everyday Sunscreen Lotion 50+ \u2014 tested at 26\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Banana Boat Baby Zinc Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50+ \u2014 tested at 28\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Bondi Sands SPF 50+ Zinc Mineral Body Lotion \u2014 tested at 26\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Cancer Council Everyday Value Sunscreen 50 \u2014 tested at 27\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Cancer Council Ultra Sunscreen 50+ \u2014 tested at 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Banana Boat Sport Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50+ \u2014 tested at 35\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Neutrogena Sheer Zinc Dry-Touch Lotion SPF 50 \u2014 tested at 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Woolworths Sunscreen Everyday Tube SPF 50+ \u2014 tested at 27\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014Nivea Sun Kids Ultra Protect and Play SPF 50+ \u2014 tested at 41\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the product that performed the worst in the test was Ultra Violette's Lean Screen SPF 50+ Mattifying Zinc Skinscreen, which returned an SPF of 4.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoice said it was so \"perturbed\" by the result that it did a second test to confirm the finding.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoice CEO Ashley de Silva said: \"We were really shocked to see the results for Ultra Violette's Lean Screen SPF 50+ product, so much so that we actually decided to test a different batch at a completely different lab in Germany to confirm the results.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Those tests found the product had an SPF of 5 \u2014 an almost identical result to our initial testing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSPF stands for Sun Protection Factor. The higher the number, the fewer UV rays reach the skin.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the four sunscreens Choice said met its SPF claims were:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 La Roche-Posay Anthelios Wet Skin Sunscreen SPF 50+ \u2014 tested at 72.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Body Lotion SPF 50 \u2014 tested at 56.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Cancer Council Kid Sunscreen 50+ \u2014 tested at 52.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Mecca Cosmetica To Save Body SPF 50+ Hydrating Sunscreen \u2014 tested at 51.\n\n\n\nSunscreen companies stand by their products\n\nUltra Violette said it did not accept the results of its tested product as \"even remotely accurate\", questioning the methodology of the test. It said its Lean Screen product contained 22.75 per cent zinc oxide and that the SPF result of 4 was \"scientifically impossible\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We find this study counterintuitive and not at all in the best interest of consumers,\" it said in a response published by Choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nCancer Council Australia \u2014 which had three products including Kids Clear Zinc 50+, Everyday Value Sunscreen 50 and Ultra Sunscreen 50+, fail Choice's test \u2014 said it was \"very concerned\" by the findings but stood by its own test results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We can confirm that we hold SPF test results from our product sponsor for each of the products Choice has tested, all of which show compliance with their labelled SPF rating,\" a spokesperson told SBS News.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Consumer watchdog alleges Optus pressured vulnerable customers into sales\n\n\"Noting the test results published by Choice and out of an abundance of caution, we have submitted the four referenced products for further testing by an independent international laboratory. All necessary actions to any findings will be implemented,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe responses of other companies were published by Choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nAldi and Coles said they requested the results for further investigation, Banana Boat said its sunscreens met the requirements set out by the medicines regulator, Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), while others, including Bondi Sands, said they disagreed with the Choice assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoice called on the TGA to undergo its own compliance tests and the consumer watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, to investigate any misleading SPF claims.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Watchdog unveils proposal to end supermarket price-gouging, shrinkflation\n\nRegulator says it's investigating\n\nThe TGA said it was investigating the Choice findings and will take regulatory action as required.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt said there could be variability in SPF testing results across laboratories, due to the reliance on human subject testing.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt said a number of the Choice-tested products returned results in the range of SPF 30, which provide \"high protection\" and are effective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Given Australia's high incidence of skin cancer, the TGA reiterates that using sunscreen is an important measure to prevent harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation, in addition to seeking shade, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, wearing protective clothing and using sunglasses.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "\n\n\n\nListen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce rare now routine but never to be taken for granted.\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld Cup qualification has been achieved by the Socceroos for a sixth consecutive time.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's two goals to one defeat of Saudi Arabia in Jeddah on the last matchday of stage three guarantees them second place in Group C, and a spot in next year's World Cup without having to go through one of the playoff rounds.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter their last-gasp win over Japan in Perth last week, they only needed to avoid defeat by five goals or more to book their place.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut perspective is required here.\n\n\n\n\n\nBooking a place at all was a result that was in some jeopardy when Tony Popovic was appointed coach in the wake of Graham Arnold's resignation nine months ago.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopovic, a former Socceroo himself, is proud to have turned that dream into reality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not something you see happening. When you're young, you dream of these things. And to be standing here, I'm very honoured with the responsibility, and I feel privileged to have this role.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a tale of individual redemption, not just that of the team.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe often-criticised striker Mitchell Duke scored the winning goal against the Saudi squad.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis typically Australian reaction to that twist of fate is also typical of the Socceroos with his determination to get back at those who doubt him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\" I wasn't even supposed to be here, to honest. Mat Leckie got injured, and I was a late call-up. Got the voodoo doll out and maybe injured Leckie! Nah...sorry, mate! But it feels good, and probably a good way to silence some of the keyboard warriors as well. Feels good.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a spot in the 2026 World Cup secure, thoughts now turn, naturally, to 2026, and the tournament, which has now been expanded to 48 teams, and is set to be co-hosted between the United States, Canada, and Mexico.\n\n\n\n\n\nCaptain Mat Ryan is leading the way in dreaming of North America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're going to enjoy, obviously, tonight, and that direct qualification now. And come, maybe not tomorrow, but in week's time or little bit longer, the prep starts for the next goal we set ourselves.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, in looking forward, sometimes you can't help looking back.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that glance in the rear-view mirror is more than pleasant for the Socceroos, who inspired the nation with victories over Denmark and Tunisia at the last World Cup in 2022, making the knockout stage for just the second time.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefender Milos Degenek was there in 2022... and is looking to build on that legacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's going to be special. There's obviously going to be a lot of Australian people supporting us in the games. But for the people who don't make it, who do stay home, hopefully we can create memories similar, and if not better than the ones we created in Qatar.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEven in an expanded tournament where 32 teams will make the knockout stage, Australia's football will need to further improve if they are to make the desired splash in 2026.\n\n\n\n\n\nPopovic says, with qualification now achieved, the truly hard work begins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, well, we have some plans obviously for September with some games. And then there;s a plan moving forward now that we know we've definitely gone throigh, we're not in the playoffs. We've got some different plans in october that we've been working on. So, it's exciting.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "A Sydney-based Islamic preacher wasn't referring to all Jewish people when he made allegedly inflammatory remarks in a series of speeches, a court has heard.\n\n\n\n\n\nWissam Haddad took the stand in the Federal Court on Wednesday in a case brought by the nation's peak Jewish body, the Executive Council of Australian Jewry's (ECAJ) co-CEO Peter Wertheim and deputy president Robert Goot.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey allege remarks made in these speeches, which came in the wake of Hamas' October 7 2023 attack on Israel , contain \"gratuitous insults and antisemitic tropes\" and have breached the Racial Discrimination Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaddad denies the breach.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe court heard that Haddad, in a lecture series titled The Jews of Al Madina, referred to Jews as \"vile\", treacherous\", \"descended from apes and pigs\", and \"hiding like the rats that they are\".\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder cross-examination, Haddad told the court he spoke about references to Jews in the Quran and Hadith at the time of the Prophet Muhammad, because \"the events that took place \u2026 those certain events are still taking place now in Israel or Palestine\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said he was referring to \"Jews of faith, not ethnicity\", and quoting religious scriptures with stories about interactions between Jewish and Muslim people in the 7th century.\n\n\n\n\n\nCounsel representing the ECAJ, Peter Braham SC, asked Haddad if his \"intent was to describe the eternal character of the Jewish people\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHaddad denied that he did, saying: \"I was talking about the Jewish people that are in power in Israel.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nHaddad was grilled about why he said in one speech \"there is no difference\" between Zionists and Jews.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There is no such thing as Zionists at the time of the Prophet\", Haddad said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said it was not his intent to describe all Jews as \"mischievous\" or \"murderous\", but said it is acceptable to say those words if they are written in religious scriptures.\n\n\n\nExecutive Council of Australian Jewry deputy president and barrister Robert Goot (centre), and Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-CEO Peter Wertheim (right) arriving at the Federal Court during the first day of the trial on Monday. Source: AAP / Bianca De Marchi\n\nKey legal question: Were Haddad's comments public or private?\n\nThe case before Justice Angus Stewart centres on five speeches made by Haddad, also known as Abu Ousayd, from November 2023 at the Al Madina Dawah Centre in Bankstown, which he co-founded, and later posted online where they have received thousands of views.\n\n\n\n\n\nApplicants Wertheim and Goot are seeking the removal of the allegedly racist speeches and injunctive relief to prevent Haddad from engaging in similar activity.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo prove a breach of the Racial Discrimination Act, the applicant\u2019s lawyers must establish the speeches were made \"otherwise than in private\".\n\n\n\n\n\nHaddad was questioned by Braham about the context in which he gave the speeches and the various social media accounts connected with the Al Madina Dawah Centre and Haddad in a personal capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe court heard Haddad has around 10,000 followers of an Instagram account under the name Abu Ousayd, and the Al Madina Dawah Centre has had and promoted social media accounts including Facebook, YouTube, Telegram, Rumble and Soundcloud.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked by Braham, Haddad agreed that \"one of the purposes the sound and video recordings were being made was to allow publication on the YouTube channel\", but denied he had any personal involvement in uploading the videos.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaddad\u2019s barrister, Andrew Boe, argues, Haddad\u2019s acts were private as he was speaking to a \"Muslim audience\", and Jewish Australians only saw Haddad\u2019s remarks through the mainstream media, or on a social media outlet \"dedicated to publishing antisemitic content\".\n\n\n\n\n\nBraham defended his line of questioning, following an objection by Boe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A very large part of the respondent\u2019s case is that these speeches were delivered in private to a purely Muslim audience, and it wasn't reasonably likely they would come to the attention of the broader community,\" Braham told Justice Stewart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That is absolutely not how this man has run his life \u2026 just about everything that happens at the Al Madina Dawah Centre is designed and calculated for public consumption and to create or attract controversy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBraham questioned Haddad about the Al Madina Dawah Centre\u2019s YouTube account being taken down from time to time, and the court heard the account has \"never been reopened\" after \"the speeches, the subject of these proceedings, went up onto [YouTube] in November 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaddad was also asked about comments he made about other religions before 7 October 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Do you remember describing Hindus as worshippers of cows and monkeys?\" Braham asked.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaddad responded: \"Yes.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You recognise seeing in mid-April 2023 on MEMRI TV, an article and video showing you describing Jews as descendants of pigs and monkeys and Hindus as being worshippers of cows and monkeys?\" Braham asked.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaddad responded: \"Yes\".\n\n\n\n'Perceived as antisemitic'\n\nHaddad\u2019s lawyers argue his comments about Jewish people have not been heard in their entirety and, taken out of context, were \"perceived to be antisemitic\" by members of the Jewish community.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe court heard from a series of lay witnesses from Australia\u2019s Jewish community who were cross-examined about how Haddad\u2019s speeches first came to their attention and their feelings of safety in Australia as Jewish people.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne witness, Robert Kaye, said he first formed the opinion Haddad expressed antisemitic views and was inciting violence against Jews through media reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I didn't see the speeches as they were delivered, only the reporting of them,\" Kaye said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The first time I saw reference to the speeches or quotes from them was when I read extracts in The Australian newspaper.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother witness, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he also first became aware of Haddad\u2019s speeches from articles in The Australian.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That caused you to form the view that Mr Haddad was an extremist \u2026 and a supporter and friend of terrorists, is that correct?\" Boe asked.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe witness agreed that he then formed the view that characterisation was true.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trial continues.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nFor millions of Australians, Buy Now, Pay Later providers like Afterpay or Zip have become a common tool to take the pain out of purchases by breaking the cost of goods or services into smaller chunks paid over several weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile their products are new, their model is a different take on a more traditional lay-by agreement, where a customer would pay off a larger purchase in two or more payments, receiving the object after paying the whole of the sum.\n\n\n\n\n\nProducts like Afterpay flip the scheme on its head, giving customers the goods or service up front and letting them delay the costs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut, until now, these credit products have managed to evade government regulation for over a decade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cToday is a positive day for Australian consumers with the law now treating Buy Now, Pay Later as what it really is: it's credit. The reason why it's taken so long is by now pay later providers had taken advantage of a loophole in the law that ensured that they didn't get covered by the credit laws that apply to all other credit, including credit cards and mortgages and the like.\"\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO How low financial literacy is exposing migrant youths in Australia to scams and risky spending SBS News 15/03/2025 08:36 Play\n\nThat's Drew MacRae, Senior policy and advocacy officer at the Financial Rights Legal Centre.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs of Tuesday, the 10th June, strict new regulations from the Albanese government have come into play with Buy Now, Pay Later providers now treated similarly to a credit card.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new laws require providers to hold an Australian credit licence, comply with existing credit laws, and have also established a new category of low-cost credit under the Credit Act.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, if you're curious about these products or if you're one of the estimated 41 per cent of Australians who've used them already in the last six months, according to a Finder survey - you may be wondering how these regulations will affect you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They have responsible lending obligations so the laws are being introduced to ensure that they take the steps they need to be assured that you can afford the credit that they're providing.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Saadat, International Head of Public Policy at Afterpay, says this means for new users there will now be additional checks and balances before they can pay for products with their service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cAnyone who's applying for an Afterpay account will be asked to agree to a credit check and will be asked to provide some additional information as part of the application process. So that's already live and it's working well. And that credit check will assist Afterpay in determining what spending limits should be allocated to the customer.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Domenique Meyrick, co-CEO of Financial Counselling Australia, says there will also be new protections for those struggling with making their payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The other big change is that it means that consumers have a right to ask for hardship if they're having difficulty making payments and they can complain to the Financial Ombudsman, AFCA or the Australian Financial Complaints Authority. And then the final thing it means is that credit checks will be done. And so, when you use Buy Now, Pay Later, it might show up on your credit report.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThis last change means that your Buy Now, Pay Later debts could impact your credit score.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile using the service responsibly can offer an opportunity to build a positive credit score, missed or late payments may affect a customer's future borrowing capacity for a house or a car.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr MacRae from the Financial Rights Legal Centre says customers should make sure they're not accepting a higher spending limit than they require as some providers may display the full amount on the user's credit report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Understand that these products will now be listed on your credit report. So, it means that if you're being offered say $4,000 for a Buy Now Pay Later facility for something that you wanted to buy use to buy $150 pair of jeans, the full amount will be on your credit report, that $4,000. So it's important to engage upfront whether you need that higher limit. If you don't need it, don't take it and make sure your Buy Now Pay Later limit is right for you and your needs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer advocates like Dr Meyrick say the new checks and balances provided by these regulations have been a long time coming.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Almost as soon as by now pay later products emerged onto the scene, financial counsellors started seeing people getting into trouble with them. We've been calling for a really long time for some protections in place.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCritics have long argued that products like Afterpay could encourage consumers to be flippant with using money they don't have and could lead vulnerable people into lasting debt.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, Afterpay's Michael Saadat says their customers are overwhelmingly responsible with their debts and he argues there are significant guard-rails in place to avoid harm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I guess the biggest difference is that a product like Afterpay is completely interest free. So unlike traditional credit products like credit cards, there's no risk that a consumer will end up in a spiral of revolving debt that's incurring interest rates of 20 per cent or more. Every transaction is four instalments. It's really straightforward. You're never charged interest and if you miss a repayment, you can't actually use Afterpay to spend again until you pay back the amount that's overdue.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe element not mentioned here are Afterpay's late fees, which have historically represented upwards of 20 per cent of their annual revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you miss an Afterpay payment you will be subject to a fee of up to 25 per cent of the cost of the order.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile this sum may not be much, Dr Domenique Meyrick of Financial Counselling Australia says costs can compound when vulnerable people are using several Buy Now, Pay Later providers at once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You see people who are using buy now pay later products for everyday items. They'll have multiple buy now, pay later products on the go at once. It's very hard to track. There's late fees accumulating.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nVicki Penner, Queensland manager of the Salvation Army's Moneycare team, says - prior to this regulation - she would see clients use Buy Now, Pay Later products lost in a debt spiral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Recently, one of our clients came in working hard, finding it hard to make ends meet. That's when he started to use Buy Now, Pay Later to fill the gap. He thought it was like a one-off time, but the next pay cycle, the same thing happened. So he continued to use the Buy Now, Pay Later, and eventually what happened was he maxed out his accounts and opened up another to cover the first repayment. This cycle actually continued until he had six Buy Now, Pay Later accounts. That's when it became unmanageable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nShe believes the new regulation will do much to protect those at risk of accruing severe debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Buy Now, Pay Later debt doesn't always come from poor choices, but it actually creeps up quietly and these reforms are here to catch those risks a lot earlier.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile consumer advocates have welcomed the transparency and accountability that regulation has brought the Buy Now, Pay Later sector, many argue there's room for further reform.\n\n\n\n\n\nDrew MacRae from the Financial Rights Legal Center says these changes don't address the issue of customers using several products concurrently and potentially generating significant debt through these providers.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "A decade after arriving in Australia, many refugees who were working as managers and professionals in their home countries are still struggling to find the same level of work.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey are experiencing an \"occupational downgrade\", according to a new report by the Australian Institute of Family Studies (AIFS).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe findings add to existing knowledge about the challenges refugees in Australia can face in gaining a foothold in the labour market.\n\n\n\n\n\nLead author of the report, John van Kooy, told SBS News: \"We looked at the jobs they were doing before they arrived in Australia and the jobs they've been able to secure, or go for, in Australia over that 10-year period. What we found was a major drop off.\"\n\n\n\n\"We're calling it occupational downgrading, which basically means for those that were working in professional and managerial roles prior to coming to Australia \u2014 in sectors like business, human resources and IT \u2014 many of those individuals, even after 10 years of permanent residency in Australia, weren't able to find the same level of employment or occupational status,\" van Kooy said.\n\n\n\n\n\nAround 2,400 humanitarian migrants were surveyed over a 10-year period from when their first visas were granted in 2013. Most of the participants were from Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Myanmar \u2014 reflecting the humanitarian intake that year.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's part of what AIFS cites as the largest longitudinal study of this cohort of migrants in Australia, capturing post-humanitarian arrival and settlement support over a longer term.\n\n\n\nA starker 'occupational downgrade' for women\n\nAccording to the study, 30 per cent of employed women and 19 per cent of employed men had worked in managerial or professional roles before arriving in Australia. That dropped to 17 and 10 per cent respectively after 10 years of residency.\n\n\n\nOnly half of the men working in their home country in business, human resources, marketing and ICT (information and communications technology) were working as technicians, tradespeople or machinery operators after a decade of residence in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \"occupational downgrade\" was starker for women.\n\n\n\n\n\nOver two-thirds (67 per cent) of women who had been managers or professionals in their home countries were not in paid work in Australia. The remaining women were mostly carers, cleaners, education aides or sales assistants.\n\n\n\nVan Kooy said women who were part of families with children under five years old were 84 per cent less likely to be in employment compared to men over that period.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study found 39 per cent of women and 63 per cent of men were in the labour force 10 years after arriving in Australia. Of those that weren't, 33 per cent and 41 per cent indicated they wanted a job.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said refugees can face various challenges, including language barriers \u2014 with those who were quickly able to acquire English language skills being more able to enter the labour force earlier \u2014 along with the recognition of skills and qualifications in Australia.\n\n\n\nA 'billion-dollar benefit'\n\nThe AIFS study references a 2024 report from Settlement Services Australia (SSI), a national not-for-profit service provider, which estimated the country's economy would benefit from a $9 billion annual boost if migrants and refugees worked in jobs that matched their full skill set.\n\n\n\n\n\nDane Moores, SSI's head of strategic relations, said almost half of permanent migrants in Australia work below their skill level \u2014 and humanitarian entrants were more likely to have their skills underutilised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Many refugees arrive in Australia with years of professional experience and valuable skills, but they face a system that devalues their expertise and puts up unnecessary roadblocks to formally recognising their qualifications,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In addition to having remarkable personal qualities like resilience and determination, professionals from refugee backgrounds bring skills we urgently need \u2014 in health, education, engineering and more. Yet many of these skills are currently being wasted.\"\n\n\n\nVan Kooy said the skills and qualification recognition system in Australia has improved, but \"there is still work to be done\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government made significant changes to Australia's migration system last year, which, in part, aimed to target skilled migration to address workforce shortages.\n\n\n\n'We're all losing out'\n\nVan Kooy said the new study shows a \"significant number\" of refugees who come to Australia with high skill levels, experience and qualifications \u2014 along with the time it can take to break into the labour market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Any time we under-utilise those qualifications, or those individuals aren't able to access the same level of employment or pursue their career aspirations, then we're all losing out,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It is a long-term investment, and a long-term journey that we need to be going along with people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Settlement is not something that happens in a two to three-year period, just after people arrive. It's a lifelong experience, and I think we need to work with that timeframe in mind.\"\n\n\n\nAcknowledging refugees have a diverse range of experiences and backgrounds, van Kooy said many show personal resilience in their journey to Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Refugees have been through traumatic journeys \u2014 often prolonged time spent in transit countries or camp situations. By the time they arrive in Australia, they have that accumulation of experience and resilience that can be an asset in terms of the economy,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It can also lead to difficulties for individuals who have experienced traumatic events.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNevertheless, van Kooy said over one-fifth of the study participants started their own business or ended up in self-employment over the 10-year period, which is higher than the rate of self-employment for the Australian-born population.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis could partly be due to difficulties in accessing the open labour market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But it does show that the refugee cohort is resilient, and they will do what they need to do to earn income and support their families, and get ahead in Australia.\"\n\n\n\n",

And what this airport will do - not just a runway or terminal, but the aerotropolis that will grow around with it the Bradfield city - is to be a catalyst for economic activity. And for Sydney to look out - not just in. And that is why this is vision is so important.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nQantas has announced it is closing down Jetstar Asia by the end of July, following years of financial losses.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt says 13 planes used by Jetstar Asia will be redeployed across Australia and New Zealand, creating 100 jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn estimated 500 jobs will be lost in the closure.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia has joined the UK, Canada, New Zealand and Norway in announcing financial sanctions and travel bans for two Israeli government ministers.\n\n\n\n\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong has confirmed the sanctions apply to Israel's National Security Minister and Finance Minister.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says they have encouraged extremist actions that have led to grave human rights violations against Palestinians.\n\n\n\n\n\nIsrael's foreign minister, Gideon Saar, says the action is outrageous - and the government has set a special meeting for early next week to decide how to respond.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe US has also condemned the sanctions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFormer Palestinian Ambassador to Australia Izzat Abdulhadi told SBS Arabic he welcomes the announcement from the Albanese government - and thinks it should go even further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I call on the Australian government to impose sanctions on Israeli government not just those two members of the government. Also, I call on the Australian government to recognise the state of Palestine immediately in the forthcoming peace conference to be held in New York frm 17th to 20th June of this year.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld leaders and diplomats will meet in in New York later this month to discuss the issue of Palestinian statehood.\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nAustria is mourning the victims of a school shooting.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe city of Graz has already held a memorial service for the 10 people killed by the 21-year-old gunman, identified by Interior Minister Gerhard Karner as a former pupil at the school who had not completed his studies.\n\n\n\n\n\nThree days of mourning have been declared in Austria.\n\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is among the world leaders to express their shock over the mass shooting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Today, my thoughts are with the families of the dead and injured, with their friends and relatives. Schools are symbols of hope in the future and youth. It's very hard to bear when schools become the scene for violence and death. I mourn today with Austria.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n+++\n\n\n\n\n\nIn football, the Socceroos have achieved automatic World Cup finals qualification for the first time in 12 years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team beat Saudi Arabia 2-1 in Jeddah.\n\n\n\n\n\nExactly a year before the start of next year's finals in the US, Canada and Mexico, Australia qualify in the second automatic spot - behind Japan and ahead of Saudi Arabia.\n\n\n\n\n\nCoach Tony Popovic has said he is happy with the team's result, but won't let them get complacent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not easy. And to show that character and resilience and then quality to come back and take the lead and win the game, so I'm delighted, and you know, we've built a good foundation now and we want to really get better and get better and kick on and try and do something special at the World Cup.\"\n\n\n\n",

After nearly six weeks, the key subject of the inquiry, Anthony Manning, is due to give evidence from 11.50am.\n\nManning was the first chief executive of School Infrastructure NSW, a government agency within the Department of Education set up in 2017 under the previous government to manage what was forecast to be a $2.6 billion investment in school building over the following four years. He left the role in February last year.\n\nFormer NSW Schools Infrastructure chief Anthony Manning, pictured here at budget estimates in 2023, is a key subject of the ICAC\u2019s public inquiry. Credit: Janie Barrett\n\nThere are two main allegations, which were outlined on day one. The first is whether Manning and others used their official functions to subvert \u201cappropriate recruitment practices to benefit friends and business associates\u201d, improperly award contracts worth millions of dollars and misallocate funds from school projects.\n\nThe second allegation is whether Manning, School Infrastructure human resource strategic adviser Wendy O\u2019Brien and others engaged in reprisal actions against staff who made complaints.\n\nThis will be the first chance to hear from Manning. His previous barrister, Tim Hale SC, had raised concerns earlier in the hearing that the arguments against Manning were \u201crelatively unspecific\u201d. \u201cThere is extreme doubt certainly from my client\u2019s point of view what actually is being alleged to be the corrupt conduct,\u201d he said.\n\nThe ICAC\u2019s livestream can be viewed here.",

        "text": "The March surge has been attributed to \u201cfront-loading,\u201d or importers rushing to build their inventories before the broader Trump tariffs, announced on April 2, which Trump labelled \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d could take effect. The existence of those inflated stocks means the impact of the tariffs on prices for consumers would take some time to filter through to inflation data. There\u2019s also a sense from the anecdotal evidence that companies are waiting for the dust to settle and a clearer picture of the final tariff settings to emerge before acting. Fed chair Jerome Powell. The central bank will want to wait until the full picture of the tariffs and the effect they have on the inflation numbers is fully reflected before cutting rates. Credit: AP The Fed\u2019s \u201cBeige Book\u201d \u2013 a compilation of surveys undertaken by the 12 regional Fed banks, said last week that there had been \u201cwidespread\u201d reports from companies that they expected costs and prices to rise at a faster rate, with some of the districts reporting that those survey expected the cost increases to be \u201cstrong, significant or substantial.\u201d All the district reports, the Fed said, indicated that higher tariff rates were putting upward pressure on costs and prices and that the companies that planned to pass through tariff-related costs to customers expected to do so within three months.\n\nThat fits with what consumer-facing companies have been saying in their investor presentations and makes sense. They are saying that the tariffs are too material to be absorbed and will be passed on. Loading Allowing for the buffer provided by the front-loading of imports in March, the question mark over what will happen when the pause on the reciprocal tariffs ends and a reluctance of companies to increase prices and lose sales until they actually experience cost increases that they expect to persist, the impact of the tariffs could be expected to show up progressively over the rest of the year. Data over the next three to six months will better reflect the impacts of the tariffs. Nevertheless, there were some early indications that the effects of Trump\u2019s earliest tariffs are showing up.\n\nThe prices of major appliances, for instance, jumped nearly 4.5 per cent last month. They were included in Trump\u2019s February tariff announcements. The prices of perishables like bananas and vegetables, where supply can\u2019t be front-loaded, rose significantly, as did toys, a segment China dominates. The price hikes in those categories were offset by a decline in the prices of new cars, a segment where the tariffs are expected to eventually have a substantial impact, eggs, gasoline and air fares. US oil prices have fallen more than 15 per cent this year amid a global glut of oil. West Texas Intermediate prices bottomed out around $US60 a barrel in May and are now trading around $US68 a barrel. Data over the next three to six months will better reflect the impacts of the tariffs on the US economy. Credit: Bloomberg The drop in airfares, which reflects a slump in demand, may have something to do with Trump\u2019s immigration policies and the harsh treatment of visitors to the US by US Customs and Border Protection personnel.\n\nWhile the May data might appear benign, it is improbable that the Fed will heed Trump\u2019s call for a percentage point cut to the federal funds rate when its Open Market Committee meets next week. The markets are assigning zero probability to a cut, although the odds on one in September improved from 60 per cent to 70 per cent after the inflation data was released. The Fed will want to wait until the full picture of the tariffs and the effect they have on the inflation numbers is fully reflected. It will also want to understand the dynamic between the tariffs\u2019 impacts on prices and their impacts on the underlying economy. It is conceivable that the tariffs, the likely price increases associated with them and the uncertainty generated by the way they have been announced \u2013 they\u2019ve evolved unpredictably and appear dependent on Trump\u2019s volatile moods \u2013 will lead to materially lower US economic growth, which would reduce demand and blunt the inflationary impact of the tariffs. It\u2019s also conceivable that the outcome could be shrinking growth and spiking inflation \u2013 stagflation \u2013 which would force the Fed to choose between combatting inflation or saving jobs. That\u2019s why the safest course for the Fed at this point is to sit on its hands until it has more useful data.\n\nTrump, of course, has always advocated for lower interest rates and has routinely verbally assaulted the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, for not delivering them. He needs them more than ever, with the Congressional Budget Office saying his \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d \u2013 his budget bill \u2013 would add $US3 trillion to US government debt over the next decade if enacted in its current form. Trump, on his Truth Social platform, in posting his plea for the Fed to cut rates, added that the US \u201cWOULD PAY MUCH LESS INTEREST ON DEBT COMING DUE. SO IMPORTANT!!!.\u201d The Republicans are tearing themselves apart \u2013 fiscal conservatives versus the Trumpists \u2013 in negotiations over the bill. Lower debt-servicing costs would help his cause. It doesn\u2019t seem to have occurred to Trump and his advisers that damaging the credibility of Powell and the Fed would be damaging to the US economy and markets and would be more likely to increase the perceived risk of investing in the US. The likelihood that the Fed will wait until at least September, if not later, before seriously contemplating a cut has led to new speculation that Trump will move to undermine Powell, reviving and refining a plan schemed up by Bessent during last year\u2019s election campaign. Powell, whose term as chair of the Fed (but not as a governor) expires in May next year, can\u2019t be removed by Trump. Bessent suggested that a \u201cshadow\u201d governor should be announced, one who would provide their own commentary on rates and inflation and, because they would be Powell\u2019s successor, increasingly undermine Powell and the Fed\u2019s credibility.",

        "text": "Abandoned by Wilson, Smile entered rock lore as a lost document of a brilliant but troubled mind. Mike Love, the Beach Boys vocalist and longtime foil of Wilson\u2019s, called it \u201ca whole album of Brian\u2019s madness\u201d. It remained unfinished for nearly 40 years. Wilson\u2019s life story came to be portrayed as a struggle to escape from the yokes of two men: his abusive father and a controlling psychotherapist, Eugene Landy. Landy\u2019s unorthodox methods were effective in nursing Wilson back to health during two periods of treatment in the 1970s and \u201980s. Yet Landy also went into business with his patient, sharing copyrights with Wilson and taking writing credits on some of his songs. Brian Wilson in 1965. Credit: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images Landy eventually came under the scrutiny of Californian authorities and surrendered his licence. After an intervention by Wilson\u2019s family, a court order also blocked Landy from contact with Wilson. Wilson spoke openly about his struggles with mental illness, including his experience with schizoaffective disorder, a condition characterised by hallucinations and delusions. The condition led to the conservatorship granted to his business associates in early 2024.\n\nBrian Douglas Wilson was born June 20, 1942, in Inglewood, California, to Murry and Audree (Korthof) Wilson. His father was a heavy-machinery salesperson who had collected a handful of credits as a frustrated songwriter. His mother, a homemaker, kept the Beach Boys\u2019 books in the early days of the band. The family moved to Hawthorne, California, when Brian was a toddler, and had two more boys, Dennis and Carl. Loading By 1961, the three Wilson boys were playing rock music with Love, a cousin, and a schoolmate of Brian\u2019s, Al Jardine. Around that time, Dennis began surfing and delighted in the fashion, trendy lingo and carefree lifestyle that went along with it. One day he told Brian and Love, \u201cYou guys ought to write a song about surfing.\u201d\n\nThey did, and that fall, the group recorded its first song, Surfin\u2019. The young men called themselves the Pendletones, after a type of flannel shirt popular among surfers. When they received the finished record, released by a small local label, Candix, they discovered that they had been renamed the Beach Boys. Signed by Capitol Records in 1962, the group was prolific from the start, releasing 10 studio LPs through 1965. The Beach Boys in 1966 (from left): Al Jardine, Mike Love, Dennis Wilson, Brian Wilson and Carl Wilson. Credit: AP Wilson became the band\u2019s primary producer and songwriter, and his sophistication soon shone through. Surfer Girl, a lilting, harmony-drenched ballad that went to No. 7 in 1963, was perhaps the first pop hit written, arranged, produced and sung by the same person. Wilson\u2019s first No. 1, however, came as a writer of Jan and Dean\u2019s song Surf City (1963). In a sign of conflicts to come, Murry Wilson, who managed the Beach Boys and controlled the band\u2019s songwriting copyrights, was furious that Brian had given a valuable hit to another act.\n\nOther problems surfaced. Surfin\u2019 U.S.A. resembled Chuck Berry\u2019s Sweet Little Sixteen a bit too closely, so Berry\u2019s name was added to the credits, and his publisher acquired the song\u2019s copyright. In December 1964, Wilson married Marilyn Rovell, who sang in a girl group called the Honeys. A few weeks later, he had a panic attack on a flight to a Beach Boys engagement in Houston and decided to quit touring to concentrate on songwriting and recording. That same year, the group fired Murry Wilson as manager. As Brian Wilson would recount, his father had long tormented him. In one form of punishment, his father would remove his glass eye and force his son to stare into the empty socket. \u201cMy dad was violent,\u201d Wilson wrote in a 2016 memoir, I Am Brian Wilson, written with Ben Greenman. \u201cHe was cruel.\u201d\n\nFreed from his father\u2019s control and the Beach Boys\u2019 touring demands, Wilson immersed himself in the studio. Pet Sounds, released in May 1966, elevated the Beach Boys\u2019 music to a level far above anything they had created before. With the rest of the group on the road, Wilson made the album primarily with studio musicians. Upon release, the album stalled at No. 10, a relative dud by Beach Boys standards. By then, however, Wilson was working on his next gem: the single Good Vibrations. The beach Boys: (from left) Bruce Johnston, David Marks, rear, Brian Wilson, Mike Love and Al Jardine in New York in 2012. Credit: Jason Decrow/Invision/AP Spliced together from months of sessions across four studios, Good Vibrations was a catchy and sonically adventurous invocation of peppy West Coast spirituality. Released in October 1966, the song became an indelible radio hit, but it was Wilson\u2019s last moment at the vanguard of pop.\n\nWilson\u2019s drug use, which had begun during happier times for the band, had grown out of control, stunting his creativity. \u201cI lost interest in writing songs,\u201d Wilson once told Rolling Stone. For about a year, starting in 1975, he was treated by Landy, whose methods included dousing his patient with cold water in the morning. He also limited his patient\u2019s contact with others, including Wilson\u2019s family, to underscore the therapist\u2019s role as \u201cthe ultimate power in this situation,\u201d as Landy once put it. Wilson continued to perform as part of the Beach Boys, but his behaviour was erratic and his drug use continued. In 1982, the Beach Boys kicked Wilson out of the group, and he returned to the care of Landy. His treatment, begun in seclusion in Hawaii, included a strict diet and vitamin regimen, with Wilson under constant supervision. Landy\u2019s techniques raised eyebrows, but in Wilson\u2019s case they seemed effective. When the singer made the press rounds in 1988 for his first solo album, Brian Wilson, he appeared fit, energetic and focused. Brian Wilson, left, and his second wife Melinda Ledbetter Wilson at the 55th annual Grammy Awards in 2013. Credit: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP\n\nThe extent of Landy\u2019s control over his patient, and his involvement in Wilson\u2019s career, drew concern among Wilson\u2019s family and people in the music industry. The two men started a business partnership, called Brains and Genius, that allowed Landy to draw profits from Wilson\u2019s recordings, films and other ventures. Landy was the executive producer of Brian Wilson, and he and his girlfriend, Alexandra Morgan, shared songwriting credits with Wilson on some tracks. Wilson said he even modified his will to make Landy its primary beneficiary. After an investigation by California authorities into his treatment of Wilson and other patients, Landy surrendered his license in 1989, though he continued to work with Wilson through their partnership. Members of Wilson\u2019s family filed a conservatorship case over Wilson\u2019s care. In 1992, as a result of a settlement in that case, Landy was barred by court order from making any contact with Wilson; his name and that of Morgan, whom he later married, were removed from song credits. Landy died in 2006 at 71. In 1995, Wilson married Melinda Ledbetter, a former model who worked at a car dealership and had sold him a Cadillac. He frequently credited her with helping him rebuild his life after his entanglement with Landy. She died in 2024. \u201cMelinda was more than my wife,\u201d Wilson said at the time. \u201cShe was my saviour. She gave me the emotional security I needed to have a career. She encouraged me to make the music that was closest to my heart. She was my anchor.\u201d",

        "text": "\u201cIt is natural that the administration would want to examine this major undertaking including progress and delivery, just as the UK government recently concluded an AUKUS review and reaffirmed its support. \u201cOur engagement with the Trump Administration and across the full political spectrum in the United States has shown clear and consistent support for AUKUS.\u201d The US Defence Department is reviewing AUKUS to see whether it aligns with President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d priorities. Credit: AP \u201cImportantly, AUKUS will grow both US and Australian defence industry as well as generating thousands of new manufacturing jobs,\u201d the spokeswoman said. Australia is investing $US3 billion ($4.6 billion) in US shipyards as part of the deal.\n\nOpposition frontbencher Bridget McKenzie said AUKUS was critical for Australia\u2019s defence. \u201c[The review is] a deeply concerning development,\u201d she said on Channel Nine\u2019s Today show. \u201cThere\u2019s now a growing list of serious issues and tasks for the prime minister with his meeting with President Trump next week. Any undermining of this serious and substantial alliance between our two countries should be of grave concern\u201d. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, who has been critical of AUKUS, questioned why Australia has not yet reviewed the scheme. \u201cThe UK is conducting a review of AUKUS. The US... is conducting a review of AUKUS,\u201d he said on X. \u201cBut Australia, which has the most at stake, has no review. Our parliament to date has been the least curious and least informed. Time to wake up?\u201d\n\nColby has previously called himself an AUKUS sceptic and last year said it would be \u201ccrazy\u201d if the arrangement resulted in nuclear-powered submarines going to the wrong places at the wrong time. Of particular concern is the US\u2019s lagging rates of submarine production, and failure to meet its own needs. As part of the AUKUS deal, the president of the day can refuse to release the boat to Australia if it is required for American defence priorities. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth while meeting with his Australian counterpart Richard Marles earlier this year. Credit: AP However, Colby expressed more optimism about AUKUS at his confirmation hearing earlier this year, saying he wanted to remove red tape and barriers to submarine production so that the partnership could be expedited. News of the review comes just days before Prime Minister Anthony Albanese expects to meet Trump on the sidelines of the G7 world leaders\u2019 summit in Canada. But on Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president\u2019s schedule for those G7 meetings was still being finalised.\n\nAlbanese\u2019s office has been contacted for comment, as was Australia\u2019s embassy in Washington, which referred questions to Canberra. At a meeting with Defence Minister Richard Marles at the start of this month, Hegseth urged Australia to lift defence spending to 3.5 per cent of GDP \u2013 a request reiterated by Colby on social media this week. Loading A UK government spokesperson said AUKUS was \u201cone of the most strategically important partnerships in decades\u201d. \u201cIt is understandable that a new administration would want to review its approach to such a major partnership, just as the UK did last year,\u201d they said. \u201cThe UK will continue to work closely with the US and Australia at all levels to maximise the benefits and opportunities which AUKUS presents for our three nations.\u201d\n\nSeveral AUKUS experts urged caution in interpreting the intent of the US review. They pointed to the fact the United Kingdom recently commenced a parliamentary inquiry into the pact, and said it was natural that the Trump administration would seek to ensure AUKUS aligned with its own priorities. The review also comes just weeks after the new US ambassador to Britain, Republican donor Warren Stephens, told a London audience that AUKUS was \u201cvital\u201d to global peace and security. Under the first pillar of the pact, Australia will purchase three to five nuclear-powered submarines from the US, starting in the 2030s, and build more through a joint initiative with the US and UK. Under the second pillar, the three nations will collaborate on advanced defence technologies. Australia is also contributing at least $US3 billion ($4.6 billion) to the US defence industrial base to shore up submarine production; $800 million has already been paid. The deal was announced in 2021 under then prime minister Scott Morrison and then US president Joe Biden. Loading\n\nSophia Gaston, UK foreign policy lead at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in London, said the British inquiry had \u201cinjected new dynamism and political edge into the UK\u2019s approach\u201d, which was helpful in taking AUKUS forward under Trump. She said it was perfectly reasonable for the new administration to conduct a review into a project as large and significant as AUKUS. \u201cWe can never be certain of where another government\u2019s review will take them, but Britain and Australia must be confident in the rationale behind AUKUS and its alignment with America\u2019s core goals of deterrence and competition towards China,\u201d Gaston said. \u201cThe best thing both allies can do during this review process is to put themselves in a posture ready to deliver some quick wins, particularly on pillar two, which will demonstrate the value in America partnering with allies to amplify its strengths in both scale and innovation.\u201d Alessio Patalano, a professor of war and strategy in East Asia at King\u2019s College London, said Colby\u2019s views on AUKUS before he joined the current administration would likely inform how AUKUS advocates perceived this review.\n\n\u201cHowever, these views are now being channelled into a government effort to \u2018audit\u2019 how AUKUS advances the US economy and security,\u201d he said. \u201cAs such, the review represents an opportunity to assess whether the current governance structure and priorities would benefit from greater focus.\u201d Supporters argue the pact is a strategic bulwark in an increasingly contested Indo-Pacific region, though critics warn that delays and shifting political dynamics could undermine its success. But British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer last month declared the AUKUS defence pact the centrepiece of his government\u2019s national security strategy, promising the UK\u2019s largest military investment since the Cold War. At a high-level event in Westminster, Starmer described AUKUS as a \u201cnational endeavour\u201d and named former national security adviser Sir Stephen Lovegrove as his special representative to lead the project.",

Comically obsessive monologues on the physiology of heartbreak are interwoven, too. McCracken gives a biomolecular hot take on the grieving process; makes excursions into neuro- and social psychology. These, and a penchant for Google-diagnosing the rarest possible disorders \u2013 yes, you can really die of a broken heart, it\u2019s called Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, apparently \u2013 are desperate measures to control the acute sense of powerlessness the show explores. A minimalist set creates a transient, liminal space reminiscent of a hotel lobby, and it\u2019s all seamlessly directed and performed, without a hint of sentiment or preachiness or over-realisation. Instead, Heartbreak Hotel offers the balm of warmth and authenticity, using a melange of cabaret, stand-up, and the brisk intimacy of a theatrical two-hander to transform the ineffable mess of life into art.\n\nReviewed by Cameron Woodhead\n\nTHEATRE\n\nThe Wrong Gods \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nArts Centre Melbourne, Fairfax Studio, until July 12 Countless clashes take hold in Sydney playwright S. Shakthidharan\u2019s follow-up to his critically acclaimed epic Counting and Cracking: that between old and new, fate and agency, tradition and technology, the rural and the metropolis, the ancient practice of animism and the worship of progress at all costs. Radhika Mudaliyar and Nadie Kammallaweera play Isha and Nirmala in The Wrong Gods. Credit: Brett Boardman These concerns find their apotheosis in the increasingly frayed relationship between Isha (Radhika Mudaliyar) and her mother Nirmala (Nadie Kammallaweera). Isha dreams of a life beyond the confines of her riverside village and finding a different truth, but is stultified by her mother\u2019s reticence to change. Nirmala is staunch and steadfast in her desire to live and die by her land, dictated by the caprices of the climate and environment. Enter Lakshmi (Vaishnavi Suryaprakash), a cog in a multinational company who Nirmala calls \u201cthe devil\u201d. Simultaneously introducing Nirmala to newfangled farming technology and financial arrangements while offering Isha the freedom to realise her dreams of becoming a scientist, Lakshmi promises a form of liberation to both women. What could go wrong?\n\nThe Wrong Gods takes its inspiration from India\u2019s \u201cgreatest planned environmental disaster\u201d, where one of the world\u2019s biggest hydropower infrastructure projects involved damming the Narmada River, a life source for millions, leading to displacement of indigenous communities and severe ecological catastrophe. Catapulting us seven years into the future in its second act, we see Nirmala protesting the ever-encroaching threat of irresponsible development on her land, aided by Devi (Manali Datar), while Isha pursues her dreams in the city. Their eventual reunion occurs under fraught circumstances none of them could have foreseen \u2013 but how they contend with it is the tension that drives the play forward. Much of the exposition occurs in the dense dialogue that\u2019s exchanged between all four characters. Credit: Brett Boardman The Wrong Gods allows space for multiple truths to exist at once, disavowing easy resolutions and the reductive tendency to pick a side. You can support Isha\u2019s desire to live a self-determined life, while wanting this same autonomy to be extended to her mother. You can wish for an easier life for Nirmala, while rejecting the ways colonial powers and corrupt state governments extract and exploit. At times, The Wrong Gods is both oversimplified and overexplained \u2013 much of the exposition occurs in the dense dialogue that\u2019s exchanged between all four characters. They flit from idea to idea at lightning speed, from the patriarchy of god worship to the overconsumption of cities that sees rural denizens as collateral damage.\n\nBut the heightened emotional stakes of the personal relationships at the play\u2019s fulcrum anchor it. Each character undergoes a metamorphosis of sorts as their perspectives and perception in the eyes of the others shift. Under Shakthidharan and Hannah Goodwin\u2019s direction, they pace around and across the deep concentric grooves of tree rings, stuck in a cycle that was imposed on them as they look for ways to resist and defy it. Loading Kammallaweera is a highlight as the exceedingly strong Nirmala, providing comedic relief even as she wrenches the rug from beneath us in an emotionally stirring performance (special mention to her machete skills). Suryaprakash keeps us guessing as to Lakshmi\u2019s motives in a stunning interplay of opacity and sincerity. Compressed into a neat 90 minutes, The Wrong Gods is significantly shorter than Counting and Cracking, but shares its deep engagement with big ideas that traverse the personal and the political.

Joe Paradise Lui and Merlynn Tong in a scene from Legends (of the Golden Arches). Credit: Jessica Wyld Merlynn Tong and Joe Paradise Lui saunter onto the stage as themselves. They\u2019re super low-key about it, and as their banter moves between shared nostalgia for, and shit-talking about, the childhoods they\u2019ve left behind, conflict emerges. It emerges that both Lui and Tong have lost older relatives with a taste for McDonald\u2019s burgers \u2013 one was a Filet-O-Fish connoisseur, the other a Big Mac fiend \u2013 and the immediate reason for their being onstage together is the aftermath of a funeral for one of these \u2013 Lui\u2019s grandfather, for whom Tong insists on observing Chinese funerary traditions. She wants to fold and burn joss paper (as underworld currency, so the deceased can bribe their way past the many lords and officials in Chinese hell) and stay up all night, lest the dead ancestor remain trapped as a hungry ghost.\n\nMourning doesn\u2019t become Joe Paradise Lui, though. He hired strippers for the funeral and has long outgrown superstitions he now finds anathema to his firmly anti-capitalist, pacifist ethos. Whether his contempt is (at least partly) a psychological defence against loss \u2013 Lui chose an artistic career and permanent exile in Australia over compulsory military service in Singapore \u2013 is a question he\u2019ll have an eternity to confront. Legends (of the Golden Arches) draws the audience into hilarious and heartfelt odyssey. Credit: Jessica Wyld In a moment of pique, Lui throws a bag of Mickey D\u2019s on the offering pyre. The act of disrespect opens a portal to a terrifying, and distinctly Chinese, hell dimension. There\u2019s a flamboyant reveal, supercharged by garish Getai performance in futuristic costume, before all hell does break loose.\n\nLoading Set designer Cherish Marrington brings the guardians of the underworld to carnivalesque life through custom-made inflatables, and the performers can only escape the funfair atmosphere after Guanyin \u2013 goddess of mercy in the Chinese pantheon \u2013 intervenes. Visually splendid video artistry from Wendy Yu illustrates the retelling of Chinese legends in this work, from the backstory of the Chinese god of war, Guan Yu, to tales of the underworld\u2019s incorruptible judge, Bao Gong. Unfortunately, the script isn\u2019t always as vibrant or effective as the design \u2013 some jokes fall flat, and some of the cultural commentary is so basic it feels patronising. When Legends (of the Golden Arches) succeeds, though, it draws the audience into a hilarious and heartfelt odyssey \u2013 one that balances respect for the living and the dead, while navigating the mystery and majesty (and absurdity) of cultural traditions ancient and modern. Reviewed by Cameron Woodhead\n\nMUSIC\n\nKaty Perry | The Lifetimes Tour \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nRod Laver Arena, until June 14 Katy Perry is pure pop. Her songs promise, and mostly deliver, a good time. And her Lifetimes concert does the same, across two and a half hours, five acts, multiple costume changes and more than 20 songs from a back catalogue stretching to 2008 (the pre-Perry Christian singer Katy Hudson gets a brief acknowledgement but no stage time). Katy Perry on stage at Rod Laver Arena. Credit: Martin Philbey But this big, spectacular, noisy and surprisingly intimate show also has grander ambitions, in which it has mixed success. It\u2019s all there in the framing device: a video game in which KP143, an \u201cenhanced\u201d version of Katy Perry, attempts to unseat Mainframe, the AI that has come to rule humanity rather than serve it. To do so, she must free the butterflies that have been captured to power the AI, and to do that she needs to collect love, in the form of glowing hearts that descend from the arena rafters.\n\nThe 143, of course, refers to the title of her latest and much-criticised album, and is tech speak for \u201cI love you\u201d (with its origins in pager messaging from the 1990s). Phew. That\u2019s a lot of freight to load onto the shoulders of a bunch of pop songs, even a set as hook-heavy as Perry\u2019s. And at times, the strain shows. Perry and her team of 10 dancers work their collective butts off. Credit: Martin Philbey The stage is set in what looks like a figure eight, though it\u2019s actually the infinity symbol; later on, while singing E.T., a lightsaber-wielding Perry does battle with a lengthy bit of heating duct that is meant to represent the \u201cinfinite worm\u201d spewed out by Mainframe. It\u2019s the weakest moment in a show that has plenty of goof and lots of camp and heaps of flying on wires, and mostly manages to deploy them to great effect. The backdrop is a wall of screens, suggestive of the importance of video to Perry\u2019s success, but also integral to the narrative; it\u2019s up here, in lengthy clips, that the framing story unfolds, while Perry is offstage changing costumes.\n\nThe four-piece band \u2013 women on guitar and keys, men on bass and drums \u2013 play beneath the screen, while Perry and her 10 dancers make full use of the elongated stage. \u201cNot a bad seat in the house,\u201d she boasts. If \u201clove\u201d is the connective tissue here \u2013 and suddenly, her bizarre proclamation upon returning to Earth after that ill-conceived Bezos-shilling space flight makes so much promotional sense \u2013 the main theme is self-actualisation. The video screen backdrop plays a crucial role in the show\u2019s narrative. Credit: Wolter Peeters In the dubiously conceived segment where the audience gets to \u201crequest\u201d songs via QR code (it sent me to a sign-up page for the tour, with no option to vote), she plucked an 11-year-old to join her onstage while she sang Thinking of You, from her 2008 album One of The Boys. Maddie from Traralgon said she\u2019d had a dream about this moment; Katy from California says keep dreaming because as this moment proves, if you dream it you can be it. The singer\u2019s continual reinvention of herself is proof of that maxim. And her performance of the ballad \u2013 playing acoustic guitar, with no backing track and nowhere to hide \u2013 was proof that beneath all the razzle-dazzle she remains a serious talent. As she says towards the end, \u201cNever forget you are the main character of your video game\u201d.\n\nThe 143 album got a cold shoulder from critics and the charts, but its songs were loudly cheered and sounded great \u2013 Woman\u2019s World and Lifetimes especially. Once the dust settles, these will, I suspect, come to be considered bona fide bangers to rank alongside Hot and Cold, Roar, California Girls and the rest (all of which got an airing, naturally). Whenever she is onstage, Perry works her butt off. Running, jumping (at the end of Act One, she literally leaps into a pit and disappears), standing atop a tall pillar, dangling upside down in a spherical cage, flying high on the back of a giant butterfly. It\u2019s spectacular, and for the most part she sings well, looks great, and appears to be having almost as much fun as her audience (a spread of ages, including many young girls, with their mums, first-wave Perry fans who\u2019ve passed the baton of sparkly empowerment on). Katy Perry is a consummate performer. Credit: Martin Philbey Perry can be a little tone-deaf at times \u2013 her Blue Origin flight reeked of privilege, and working with producer Dr Luke was problematic at the least \u2013 but so much of the recent criticism of her smacks of ageism. She knows it, too. When she finished a terrific rendition of Teenage Dream, she responded to a call from a fan. \u201cOh still? I can be your hall pass still? I\u2019m 40 years old.

A septuagenerian Milli Vanilli? Did they have ties to notorious London gangsters the Kray brothers? Did Bas do a stint playing piano on cruise ships? I\u2019ve looked into all this. The answers are far less interesting than the questions. So maybe it\u2019s a joke. But the joke wouldn\u2019t land if they weren\u2019t actually great. Are Pete and Bas actors? An elaborate bit of performance art? Credit: Mandy Wu Their flow (on the recordings at least, more on that later) is fast, aggressive, razor sharp.

Bas drags an excited young woman on stage.\u201cI f--ken love you c---s!\u201d she screams into the mic before twerking her way through the next track, Pint and a Fag.\n\nLoading The crowd are rowdy. Half a dozen people are hauled up to dance and occasionally rap. It is, as Bas puts it, \u201cgettin\u2019 a little bit lively\u201d. Pete throws a wad of cash into the crowd. Like the rest of the night, I can\u2019t quite tell if it\u2019s real or not. At 70-something, they do struggle to keep up with the flow. The backing tracks come complete with the recorded vocals as guides, and occasionally they lose track and mumble their way through a verse. It doesn\u2019t hinder the night as much as you might think. After about an hour ,they wrap up with Mr Worldwide (\u201cKeep one eye open for the plainclothes / I need more leg room for the plane home\u201d), and they\u2019re off. \u201cBack to our coffins,\u201d as Pete puts it. It\u2019s possible I\u2019ve just seen a couple of elderly actors fumble through a lip sync for an hour at the behest of a canny management company. I don\u2019t know!

The AFL\u2019s match review officer Michael Christian ruled Tom Stewart\u2019s bump on Gold Coast skipper Noah Anderson was within the rules. Credit: Fox Footy Sometimes the bump works, like when Geelong\u2019s Stewart collected Gold Coast\u2019s Noah Anderson last weekend, but it\u2019s a gamble. But if Anderson had been concussed, Stewart would\u2019ve missed weeks. If Anderson slipped at the last second, he might have copped a shoulder to the head, and there would have been little Stewart could have done to control that. Stewart had other options: intercepting a dribbling ball or tackling if Anderson had control. Joel Amartey bumped Jordan Boyd in round 10, resulting in concussion and a suspension. On Sunday night, Durham was second to the ball \u2013 he should\u2019ve waited for Cerra and then tackled. Instead, he bumped, with consequences.\n\nSo why would players cling to this old action as the game moves forward? Suspensions mean time off the field and letting your team down \u2013 worse, a bump risks lifelong harm to an opponent. We will make mistakes, but how far we go wrong is what counts. The Blues remonstrate with Sam Durham and his Bombers\u2019 teammates after Adam Cerra was crunched by Sam Durham. Credit: AFL Photos When I approach a contest, I\u2019m not thinking about cleaning someone up with a bump. I focus on what we train: stutter steps to slow my speed, stay agile, and react to tiny changes. Before I arrive, I assess the numbers \u2013 do I need to contest or is a teammate better placed? If I\u2019m close, I read how my opponent approaches \u2013 front-on or side-on \u2013 then decide how to contest safely, avoiding frees or injury risks. That aggressive body-on-body hit? It\u2019s disappearing \u2013 at least in bump form. Stewart\u2019s teammate Mitch Duncan said coaches are actively teaching players to avoid those high-risk actions.\n\nLoading That\u2019s not to say I won\u2019t put my body on the line like most AFL and AFLW players. It\u2019s not about courage or toughness. We all want to win. We all have white-line fever \u2013 the drive for teammates and club. But let\u2019s do it with elite skills \u2013 in the air, on the ground, and with precise tackles. Let\u2019s play as we train, guided by specialist coaches every day. Some say it\u2019s instinct to protect yourself in collisions, like when Essendon\u2019s Peter Wright took out Sydney\u2019s Harry Cunningham last year. But that shoulder bump wasn\u2019t instinct \u2013 it was a choice. He got four matches. That\u2019s no longer a footy action. Spoiling the mark would\u2019ve been the right play. Instinct can be trained. When I hear \u201cit\u2019s just instinct,\u201d I wonder, would you do that to a teammate at training? No. We don\u2019t train to bump or sling tackle. We train to win the ball cleanly and protect each other. So why do it in a game if you\u2019d never do it in training?\n\nBeing tough and uncompromising is still footy \u2013 but it can be done without knocking someone out or missing weeks. Brayden Maynard\u2019s attempt to smother in the 2023 qualifying final against Melbourne, while cleared by the AFL tribunal as a football action, resulted in a bump which, along with earlier concussions, left Angus Brayshaw with lifelong consequences. This isn\u2019t something we train; it\u2019s what happens when heat overrides discipline. Collingwood recruit Dan Houston did something similar in round four of this year against Carlton and was suspended for two matches. I\u2019m sure he and many others didn\u2019t mean to cause any harm, but fast decisions in a heated contest carry high risks. Discipline matters \u2013 the best players are brave and disciplined. They stick to the process: win the ball, be physical, and be smart. Mistakes happen, but the goal is to win safely and skilfully \u2013 for your health and your opponents\u2019.\n\nThe game\u2019s future is at stake This isn\u2019t just about individual actions. It\u2019s about protecting the future. Angus Brayshaw\u2019s AFL career ended prematurely because of concussion. Credit: Archives The AFL faces concussion lawsuits from former players. We\u2019ve lost incredible athletes, including Brayshaw, too early due to repeated head trauma. His retirement was alarming \u2013 he loved the game but had to protect his brain health. This is a real risk, not just missing games, but living with conditions like CTE linked to repeated head knocks. We can\u2019t ignore this. It\u2019s preventable \u2013 if we make better choices now. Serious injuries will always happen in our sport, but we must control what we can.\n\nLoading Parents and kids watch. We want the next generation to love footy \u2013 not turn away from it. We want them to know footy can be safe, exciting, physical, and skilful all at once. It starts with us \u2013 AFLW and AFL players. We are role models. What we do is copied on local fields across the country. Let\u2019s show them the right way. The game is in great shape: fast, skilful, physical, and evolving. We can adapt or be left behind. So, yes, I choose not to bump.",

        "text": "The council hopes by waiving secondary dwelling fees, it'll encourage more landowners to build and rent out granny flats.\n\nAn Aussie council is waiving application fees for residents seeking to build granny flats on their property in a bid they hope will provide some relief to the housing crisis. Source: Noosa Council\n\nAs Australia's housing crisis deepens, more councils are rolling out new measures aimed at easing the pressure on those struggling to find a place to call home.\n\nThis week in Australia, the median home price across the entire country rose to over $1 million \u2014 a first in history \u2014 with renters also facing record-high prices in large parts of the nation. Recently, some councils have announced they'll allow people to live in caravans and tiny homes on wheels on private property, providing short-term accommodation for those in desperate need.\n\n\"If something this small can make life a bit easier for someone, then I think it\u2019s the least we can do,\" Shire of Manjimup President Donelle Buegge told Yahoo News after announcing the scheme.\n\nNow, Noosa landowners can build secondary dwellings, such as granny flats, without paying infrastructure charges. This is in contrast to most parts of the country, where councils normally charge infrastructure contributions or developer fees for additional dwellings.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLocal authorities say these charges help cover the cost of additional strain on local infrastructure, like roads, water, sewerage, and community services, that comes with increased housing density.\n\nLocals to save $7000 in application fees\n\nThat's all about to change in Noosa, however, with the changes about to be ushered in in the new financial year. Council\u2019s director of development and regulation, Richard MacGillivray, said scrapping infrastructure charges for new secondary dwellings would save applicants roughly $7,000 on average.\n\nGranny flats are an easy way to provide accommodation relief to battling Aussies, experts say. Source: Supplied\n\nThe council hopes waiving infrastructure charges will encourage more landowners to build and rent out granny flats, helping address demand for affordable, long-term housing, particularly for singles, couples, and older residents. It said dwellings must be used for permanent accommodation and cannot be listed as short-term rentals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"This change takes effect from the new financial year, so any infrastructure charge notices issued prior to July 1 are still payable,\" MacGillivray said in a statement.\n\nCouncil's standout policy amid broader Australian trend\n\nIt's a move property experts have long called for, saying it's one easy way to increase availability in suburbs in particular. Noosa\u2019s move to scrap infrastructure charges for secondary dwellings is part of this broader trend, but it\u2019s still not the norm nationally, making it a standout policy decision that could influence other councils to follow suit.\n\nSeveral locations across Australia have introduced changes to encourage the construction of granny flats. In Victoria, from December 2023, homeowners can build a small second dwelling of up to 60 square metres without needing a planning permit, provided the land is over 300 square metres and free of environmental or flood overlays.\n\nIn Western Australia, from April 2024, granny flats are allowed to be built on any residential lot without planning approval, as long as they meet local setback requirements and stay under 70 square metres.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNoosa Mayor Frank Wilkie said granny flats offer a sustainable solution to the housing shortage, and hopes scrapping infrastructure charges will encourage more residents to build and rent them out.\n\n\"We hope by removing the infrastructure charges, which are typically several thousand dollars per application, we will see more people build them and offer them for rent,\" he said.\n\nIn addition to waiving fees, the council will also remove development application fees for not-for-profit housing providers where projects are fully dedicated to affordable rentals. Private developers may also be eligible for waived fees if their developments include long-term affordable rental units.\n\nWilkie acknowledged the financial challenges of building affordable rentals. \"We realise building affordable rental premises needs to stack up financially given the cost of land and construction, so these incentives will help,\" he said, adding that the incentives form part of a broader strategy to address Noosa\u2019s housing crisis\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWilkie also highlighted upcoming planning scheme amendments aimed at boosting the supply of smaller, affordable homes for key workers, older residents, and small households, now awaiting ministerial approval. All of the financial incentives apply from July 1, 2025.\n\nDo you have a story tip? Email: newsroomau@yahoonews.com.\n\nYou can also follow us on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and YouTube.",

Source: The Lott\n\nAustralians taking part in Thursday's incredible $100 million Powerball prize stand a chance to share the title of Australia\u2019s third-biggest lottery winner ever. Just six people know what it\u2019s like to win the $100 million prize across the country, but that all could change come this Thursday at 7.30pm AEST.\n\nAt 5.47pm on the day of the last $100 million draw, back in November 2024, ticket sales peaked, with 6,415 entries sold in just one minute.

While it's easy to get swept up in the excitement, if you're thinking about taking a swing, the chances of you actually pocketing the big Powerball jackpot are incredibly slim.\n\nAccording to The Lott themselves, the chances of scoring a Powerball jackpot are 1 in 134,490,400.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWe often hear in the news that meteorites fly by earth, sometimes coming a little too close for comfort.

        "text": "A very 'clever' owl's performance in Queensland last week has highlighted an increase in incidents of birds getting trapped in large retail stores.\n\nStaff at an Officeworks in Queensland called for help last week after they made a concerning discovery. Source: Keith Porteous/The Wildlife Rescuer\n\nA call from concerned staff at an Officeworks store has triggered a three-day rescue mission after a surprise visitor was spotted chucking laps around the store\u2019s roof. Employees were stunned to discover one morning last week that a boobook owl had also decided to clock in at the Maroochydore venue, in Queensland.\n\nHoping the bird would realise his error and head home, they placed a bowl of water on the ground in a bid to keep him comfortable. But as the owl continued to flap his wings metres above their heads, staff realised they needed proper help.\n\nEnter Keith Porteous, otherwise known online as The Wildlife Rescuer.\n\nAfter arriving at the Officeworks, the Sunshine Coast local told Yahoo News he tried to catch the owl as it slept during the day but it was \u201ctoo clever for that\u201d. The following day he tried to lure the boobook down with mealworms and mice, but it wouldn't budge.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t coming down at all. I think because the store had the lights on 24 hours, and the bird being nocturnal, it was totally spun out by that,\u201d Porteous said.\n\n\u201cThe factor that concerned me most is, like all big stores, they lay baits for rodents, so there was a high possibility it might pick up one of those in the store. So I was quite keen to get it out as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nOwl stuck in Officeworks rescued after three days\n\nFinally, after eluding Porteous for three days, the owl, which had likely chased his dinner into the warehouse, was captured with the help of \u201can extremely fine net that is virtually invisible to the bird\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an unnatural place, with very, very high ceilings and very, very low doors, and the doors are glass as well, so the birds can\u2019t understand that. So they get their way in there, and they just can\u2019t navigate their way out,\u201d the rescuer told Yahoo.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nVideo footage shows Porteous repeatedly trying to catch the owl as it flaps across the rows of shelves, before gently retrieving it with the large net. After cutting off the netting in the store\u2019s locker room, he found the bird was healthy and released it in the carpark.\n\nKeith Porteous said he's seen a huge increase in call-outs for birds stuck in stores this year, but he's unsure why. Source: Keith Porteous/The Wildlife Rescuer\n\nRescuer sees huge jump in call-outs for birds stuck in stores\n\nWhile one of the great perks of living in Australia is being able to observe its distinct wildlife, such incidents appear to be occurring more frequently.\n\nLast year Bunnings shoppers shared concerns for the welfare of a barn owl flying around a shop in Melbourne\u2019s west. Earlier this year, two Coles stores were visited by curious magpies, one of which frequented a Canberra supermarket for a month.\n\nUsually, Porteous responds to two to three call-outs for birds stuck in stores a year. In the past six months he has completed 10 to 12 rescues. \u201cOver the last few years I have done quite a lot, but it\u2019s stepped up a heap this year compared to others,\u201d he told Yahoo.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever Porteous said he wasn\u2019t sure if the increase was due to it occurring more often, or if locals were simply more familiar with his work and know he can handle such situations.\n\nOther wildlife rescuers have also noted a jump in the number of birds getting caught in shops, with Nigel Williamson previously telling Yahoo it seems to be \u201chappening more and more often\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting birds out of supermarkets for 40 years now, but it does seem to me that I\u2019m doing more and more of them as time goes on,\" he said in March.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
