        "text": "T\ufeffwo of the big banks have hiked their interest rates on savings accounts in response to Tuesday's cash rate rise.\n\nBoth the Commonwealth Bank and Westpac have increased select saving rates by 0.25 per cent, at the same time as hiking their home loan rates.\ufeff\n\nA number of smaller banks have also passed on the increase.\n\nREAD MORE: Deal reached to save collapsed private hospitals\n\nTwo of the big banks have announced they will raise their interest rate on select savings accounts. (Dominic Lorrimer)\n\n\ufeffBut according to Canstar, many account holders don't meet the criteria to enjoy the bonus interest.\n\nA recent survey of more than 1000 Australians with a savings account that has terms and conditions required to reach the maximum interest found 41 per cent do not meet the conditions each month.\n\nThis includes 11 per cent who say they never meet the conditions.\n\nThe standard rate is often inconsequential in comparison.\n\nFor example, the Commonwealth Bank's Goal Saver account attracts 4.50 per cent bonus interest, but only 0.25 per cent in standard interest.\n\nConditions can include terms like making a deposit, or increasing the account balance, each month or making no withdrawals.\n\n\ufeff\"CBA has lifted the maximum rate on its popular Goal Saver account to 4.50 per cent, which will be a win for engaged savers. However, like Westpac, customers need to meet the bank's monthly terms and conditions or risk seeing their rate fall to an inch off the floor,\" Canstar.com.au's data insights director, Sally Tindall, said.\n\n\"\ufeffCBA is also lifting the rate on its NetBank Saver, to a headline rate of 4.70 per cent for new customers for the first five months, however, existing customers will only see a boost of 0.15.\n\n\"That said, it's more than Westpac's online saver rate for existing customers, which isn't moving at all.\n\n\"These rate decisions, where banks pick and choose which rates within a savings account get a boost and which miss out, are a great reminder of how important the fine print is when it comes to something as seemingly simple as a savings rate.\"\n\nShe said customers must check the conditions regularly to ensure they're making the most of their money.\ufeff\n\n\"Canstar research shows two in five bonus savers miss out on earning the maximum interest every month, so it's imperative people understand the conditions and consider whether a simpler account might suit them better.\n\n\"In a market where top savings rates are now pushing into the 5's again, savers should shop around if their bank isn't rewarding them for their loyalty.\"",

        "text": "Australians are addicted to powder and it's coming at a cost.\n\nThe thrill of \"Japow\", or Japanese powder, attracts more tourists from Australia than any other country to Japan's snow-covered slopes.\n\nSkiers and snowboarders are drawn to the unique snow, which is softer and easier on the joints.\n\nBut it's not all fun and games.\n\nThe tragic deaths of three Australians on Japan's ski slopes already this year have reinforced the dangers of alpine sports.\n\nFurther underlining the risks, figures from two insurance companies suggest claims related to injuries from snow sports in Japan have spiked in recent years.\n\nSouthern Cross Travel Insurance's chief customer officer Jess Strange said the number of customers who claimed for skiing and snowboarding accidents in Japan increased 75 per cent between 2023 and 2025.\n\nShe said the average cost of each claim during that time was between $1,100 and $1,500.\n\nNatalie Ball, 1Cover's chief operating officer, also said there was a \"significant increase\" over the past three years, including a 43 per cent spike in claims from 2024 to 2025.\n\n\"While overall Japan policy sales have grown strongly, winter sports add-ons are growing faster, indicating a rising number of travellers heading to Japan specifically for skiing and snowboarding,\" Ms Ball said.\n\nVisits peak in January where Australian tour operators and accommodation providers are booked up with tourists from all over the world \u2014 coining the term \"Japanuary\".\n\nOwen Lansbury is the communications director from the Mountain Safety Collective, a not-for-profit that supports back-country skiers with condition reports and avalanche training.\n\n\"It's easily the best ski destination for Australians in terms of ease of travel, value for money, amazing food, fascinating culture, welcoming people, and of course the incredible snow,\" he said.\n\nBut the rise in foreigners hitting the slopes seems to be contributing to more accidents, said Makoto Takayanagi, the head of Japan's National Ski Safety Measures Council.\n\nJust in Hokkaido, 48 of the 53 off-piste ski-related accidents from November 1 to February 2 involved foreigners, he said.\n\nSo what can Australians visiting Japan's snowfields do to stay safe both at resorts and in the back-country?\n\nRespect nature\n\nCompared to Australia, Japan receives much more \"dry\" snow throughout winter.\n\nIt is the result of frigid Siberian winds meeting the warm air from Sea of Japan and condensing into snow clouds that blow across Hokkaido and Japan's alps, blanketing them with fine powder.\n\nJapan's snow and resorts are unique and need to be understood by those hitting the slopes according to experts. (Kyodo via Reuters/file)\n\nThomas Gellie, a ski coach and founder of Big Picture Skiing, said this made Japan's snow softer, more forgiving on the body and joints, and easy to ski on.\n\n\"Good snow quality makes skiing so much easier and it's why people travel to find it,\" Mr Gellie said.\n\nBut Mr Lansbury said soft, deep snow could also turn a minor accident like a face plant into a fatal incident if no help was close by.\n\nAustralians in Japan shaken by ski deaths but say its snowfields are safe Australians working in Japan's ski fields say while the sport has unpredictable risks, there are ways to be prepared.\n\nShota Tanaka, a wilderness medicine physician in Japan and back-country skier, said skiing and snowboarding were inherently dangerous sports regardless of which country people visit.\n\n\"It is essential to recognise that winter sports involve a continuous interaction with environmental stressors \u2014 cold exposure, altitude, terrain variability, and weather instability,\" Dr Tanaka said.\n\nCompared to other winter sport destinations like Switzerland, the United States, and New Zealand, Japan has smaller mountains with smaller vertical drops which people can mistakenly perceive as less risky, he said.\n\nBut he added that although access to off-piste areas can feel easier in Japan, the country's terrain is often steep and heavily forested, and should not be underestimated.\n\nObserve local culture\n\nMr Lansbury has been visiting Japan's snow fields for 20 years and said the differences in skiing there compared to Australia can be significant.\n\nHe said the weather and snow conditions can be more intense, with deeper snow and limited visibility even when skiing on-piste, mainly at resorts.\n\nSome resort infrastructure like ski lifts might be less modern or well maintained than in Australia so people needed to take more responsibility for their personal safety than they would back home, he added.\n\nSome facilities may not be kept up to Australian standards in Japanese snow resorts. (Reuters: Mariko Katsumura, file)\n\n\"Be aware that the lift attendants may not speak fluent English to provide warnings and some warning signs may not be translated into English,\" he said.\n\nDespite the many Australian tour operators and accommodation providers in Japan, ski coach Thomas Gellie urged people to look up and respect Japanese culture and etiquette.\n\nEating and drinking while walking might be fine in Australia but it's frowned upon in Japan, as was drinking too much and talking loudly, he said.\n\n\"It might not be for their safety but it is if we want to continue being welcomed in the country,\" Mr Gellie said.\n\nKnow your limitations\n\nExperts stressed the importance of not overestimating one's abilities.\n\nFor those planning to ski off-piste or in deep powder, taking an avalanche education course was imperative to understand the risks and how to use a safety kit.\n\nNiseko's drawcard is making it too expensive for locals International tourists, especially Australians, started to arrive en masse in the famous Japanese ski resort of Niseko in the early 2000s. Now the influx has pushed the cost of housing so high it's almost impossible for locals to compete with wealthy foreigners for property.\n\nMr Lansbury said skiing powder snow was its own skill that should not be rushed and to make use of local instructors to build skills and confidence.\n\n\"You can have 40 years of skiing experience and still be learning new things,\" he said.\n\n\"Accidents happen when people overestimate their abilities and underestimate the [potentially fatal] consequences of going into terrain without the required skills, experience and equipment.\"\n\nOnce skiing within resorts was mastered, Dr Shota said people looking to go off-piste should travel with a certified guide with extensive knowledge of the local terrain.\n\n\"I avoid pushing limits in poor weather and never hesitate to cancel plans when conditions are unfavourable,\" he said.\n\nUnderstand travel insurance\n\nAustralians should ensure they check their travel insurance included snow sports and to take out additional cover if needed, insurance providers said.\n\nOwen Lansbury says Australians need to take a higher degree of personal safety when skiing in Japan than they would back home. (Supplied: Matt Nethery)\n\n\"Failing to do so can turn a serious injury into an enormously expensive and highly stressful ordeal,\" said Ms Ball from 1Cover.\n\nMr Lansbury warned skiers about leaving a resort's boundary for fresh, unmarked snow, saying the consequences could be worse than in Australia because of the deeper volume of snow.\n\n\"The moment you go underneath a boundary rope there is no avalanche control and no ski patrol to help you if you get stuck or injured,\" he said.\n\nHe added that Japanese ski patrols will typically not go beyond the resort's boundary, leaving rescues to the police which can take much longer and cost thousands of dollars.\n\nExperts say following warnings signs and staying away from blocked-off areas is critical to keeping safe at ski resorts. (Reuters: Mariko Katsumura, file)\n\nMs Strange from Southern Cross Travel Insurance said skiers and snowboarders are likely to be covered when they stick to designated commercial ski areas that are open for use, follow resort rules and signage, and wear a helmet at all times.\n\nShe also said while medical expenses are covered by travel insurance, damage to equipment is generally not covered so this needed to be factored in.\n\n\"Understanding your cover before you travel means you can focus on enjoying Japan's amazing snow safely and confidently,\" she said.",

        "text": "For expectant mothers living across Western Australia's vast remote north, getting to the nearest hospital is not always straightforward.\n\nFar from having a go-bag ready for when contractions start, pregnant women living in towns across the Kimberley are often expected to relocate weeks, if not months, before they are due to give birth.\n\nThe tyranny of distance hits close to home for Darlene Cox, from Noonkanbah, a 5.5-hour, 380-kilometre drive from the main hospital offering maternity care in Broome.\n\nAdding to the challenges facing both expectant mums and their obstetrics carers is the greater number of moderate-to-high-risk pregnancies.\n\nA mobile ultrasound unit, which can travel to remote communities, has been suggested as a possible solution. (ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\nThese are driven by high rates of preventable conditions across the Kimberley, including potentially fatal rheumatic heart disease, and diabetes, which disproportionately affects First Nations women.\n\nKimberley obstetricians and midwives say this is largely due to social and environmental factors and the difficulties in detecting and diagnosing conditions early in remote Indigenous communities.\n\nMs Cox, who is diabetic, has been staying in motels and Aboriginal Short Stay accommodation in Broome for the past two months.\n\nDarlene Cox has been receiving prenatal care in Broome and is considered to be at higher risk due to her diabetes. (ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\n\"It is a challenge being away from your community, especially where you grew up and lived for that long, not seeing family and friends' faces,\" Ms Cox said.\n\n\" This is my first child and I don't get to see my mother because she's back in her home town. \"\n\nMs Cox said the hundreds of kilometres of travel was getting too difficult to manage.\n\n\"There is transport, but it's the distance and because of raining season, it's hard vehicle-wise in and out of town,\" she said.\n\n\"It would be hard for a pregnant woman travelling in the bus or the car for hours, and you're nearly eight-and-a-half months pregnant.\"\n\nHigher-risk challenges\n\nBroome Hospital obstetrician and gynaecologist Lauren Kite said the Kimberley had a very different patient profile to metropolitan areas.\n\nLauren Kite says early detection of rheumatic heart disease can make a world of difference. (ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\n\"One of the biggest ones we see is diabetes, which we do see in other areas, but much more frequently here,\" Dr Kite said.\n\n\"And then we have more uncommon conditions than in capital cities, like rheumatic heart disease.\"\n\nCardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of maternal death in Australia, and, often, issues such as rheumatic heart disease should be entirely preventable.\n\nThe hospital provides pamphlets with advice to young expectant parents. (ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\n\"It goes back to our social and environmental situation,\" Dr Kite said.\n\n\"If you're repeatedly exposed to it, if you don't have access to clean water, if you live in overcrowded housing, all of that can make it more likely that you develop the condition.\"\n\nMobile outreach services, telehealth and increased education for medical staff and community members are among the solutions being explored.\n\n\"It'd be amazing to be able to get to more places with some of our obstetric practitioners, doctors and midwives,\" Dr Kite said.\n\n\"We do have reasonable midwifery coverage, but not as frequent as would be best \u2026 to have the money to do that and the time and staff would make a big difference.\"\n\nMobile monitoring a possibility\n\nBroome hospital acting clinical maternity manager Verity Bradley said the service was looking into a mobile ultrasound unit that could be used remotely.\n\nVerity Bradley says pregnant women presenting to Broome Hospital are considered a moderate to high-risk cohort. (ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\n\"We say, 'Right, off you pop, jump on the bus and come to Broome; we need to do some sugar monitoring, you might need an echocardiogram or an obstetric ultrasound,'\" she said.\n\n\" But for some that's 8 hours away and they've got other children, they've got work commitments, financial commitments, partners \u2026 it's not as simple. \"\n\nWhile promising in theory, the outreach approach poses its own challenges \u2014 particularly finding the staff to work and support patients in remote locations.\n\n\"Staffing's really challenging in the Kimberley, we have lots of housing issues in Broome,\" Ms Bradley said.\n\n\"We also have \u2026 crime, so getting recruitment and retention of staff can be really hard.\"\n\nEducation led solutions\n\nThe Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) has started running an in-person training program in remote locations across the country.\n\nDubbing access to maternity and gynaecological care in the Kimberley a \"postcode lottery\", the organisation has been working to bridge the barriers also faced by clinicians in their training.\n\nMaternity access in the Kimberley has been described as a \"postcode lottery\". (ABC Kimberley: Ruby Littler)\n\nRANZCOG vice-president Jared Watts said the training sessions would improve the skills of regional medical practitioners, in turn leading to better care for patients.\n\n\"Trying to keep up to date can be really hard wherever you live, but in places like the Kimberley or anywhere rural it can be really difficult,\" he said.\n\n\"Because you can't get into conferences in the big cities or go to a workshop.\n\n\"So we take the teaching to where to people actually are.\"",

        "text": "There was always going to be something difficult behind the hard, unapologetic music by legendary Adelaide rockers The Mark of Cain.\n\nA dark and powerful band that uses combat themes in its imagery \u2014 yet screams with an expressive intelligence that could start a riot in the right setting \u2014 could only be so strong with something deep at its core.\n\nPeople identify with the band and attach their own trials to the lyrics, but this week, its lead singer revealed what that \"thing\" was, and it's far more brutal than their music.\n\nFor nearly 60 years, the lead singer has hidden the fact that she identifies as a woman, having learnt her true nature as a child.\n\nOn Monday, she announced that family and friends know her Josie Scott, or \"Jo for short\".\n\n\"I knew who I was when I was eight or nine years old, like many transpeople, and it was just a matter of what I saw as trying to endure it,\" she told ABC Radio Adelaide's Jo Laverty.\n\n\" No-one knew. I didn't share it with anyone. I always kept journals, and if they were found in the event of my death, that would have been the revealing aspect of it. \"\n\nLGBTQI+ community support services ABCQueer has compiled this list of national and state-based support services relevant to LGBTQI+ people, their families and friends.\n\nWhile her journal entries became more honest in recent years, Scott said as a young person she would write about this \"thing\", this \"thing I have\".\n\n\"I didn't really spell it out. I did later on, but I kept it very close to my heart.\"\n\nScott said that, like many people, she would self-medicate with a \"different variety of things\" to deal with hiding herself.\n\n\"A lot of it was in denial, but also for me, I was searching for some sort of philosophy that would get me through, whether it was stoicism, existentialism, something that could say, 'Everything's bad, but you push through',\" she said.\n\nMaking their mark\n\nTMOC was formed in the mid-1980s with Scott on lead guitar and brother, Kim Scott, on bass.\n\nBrother and TMOC bass player Kim Scott has played alongside Josie since the mid-1980s. (Website: The Mark of Cain)\n\nIts original lead singer, Rod Archer, left after a short period and Scott took over vocals, with TMOC releasing their first album, Battlesick, in 1989.\n\nTheir critically acclaimed work was followed up with The Unclaimed Prize in 1991, and then their breakthrough album, Ill At Ease, in 1995.\n\nThe latter is in Rolling Stone's top 200 Australian albums of all time.\n\nScott said she left \"little trails, pieces and breadcrumbs\" in her music about her true identity, which was \"always informing it\".\n\nBut it was Ill At Ease, she says, that became the \"real encapsulation of everything, and ill at ease is how I felt\".\n\n\"I felt it also described other people's feelings about the world, how they feel and whether they connect or not,\" she said.\n\n\"It was also about a relationship that had broken up, there's all sorts of threads through that, but I think you'll find something about it in every album.\"\n\nDavid Bowie inspires\n\nScott was always impressed by artists like The Cure, or David Bowie, and people who were \"just themselves, people who were loud and proud\".\n\n\"Music was my saviour. Also, music allows some expression, although I never allowed myself that expression,\" she said.\n\n\" I looked at David Bowie and thought, 'Wow, that would be really cool to express like that', but I never allowed myself. \"\n\nJosie Scott fronts the band alongside brother and bass player Kim Scott. (Facebook: The Mark of Cain)\n\nShe put it down to \"social conditioning\".\n\n\"Put yourself out like that, it's ridicule, shame, there's a whole lot of things to work through,\" Scott said.\n\nScott said it was also of the era to deny your true nature if it didn't fit in, a generation that tended not to just \"be who I wanted to be, do what I wanted to do\", but instead worked to be the best person they could for their parents.\n\n\"No-one knew, not even Kim. It was a surprise for him, that's how well guarded I was,\" she said.\n\nScott said it was while being sick with COVID-19 during her \"normal end-of-decade reflection\", that she made the decision to come out.\n\n\" I was like, 'Are you going to be OK if that kills you, and do we have any regrets?' And it was like, 'Yeah, I have regrets. I have never been authentic', and that's what led me to say, 'Right, let's do something about this.' \"\n\nScott made her public announcement at exactly 9pm CDST on Monday, which she posted on social media before going to bed feeling \"sick\" with worry about the responses her post might attract.\n\nHer brother, Kim, and partner, Maggie, told Scott she could stop worrying because it had been met with a near-resounding positivity by TMOC's audience and colleagues.\n\nAs well as more than 1,000 encouraging comments from fans, other Australian bands like Regurgitator, Frenzel Rhomb and Spiderbait have given Scott their support.\n\n\"In the morning, I had a lot of people reaching out, people from 30 years ago, people from the US, the UK, people I didn't even know,\" Scott said.\n\n\"I was like, 'Wow, it restores your faith in humanity' \u2026 almost.\"\n\nNew album in the works\n\nSince Ill at Ease, TMOC has released two more studio albums, This is This and Songs of the Third and Fifth, and two live albums, including 2023's Livid Live '96.\n\nThe band was inducted into the SA Music Hall of Fame in 2022.\n\nTMOC's most recent drummer, Eli Green, has brought new songs to the band. (Website: The Mark of Cain)\n\nAside from perhaps appearing a little more \"androgynous\" at the band's next live show, Scott said nothing would change for TMOC.\n\nThe band still rehearses every Saturday, and has been writing new songs, having about eight songs that \"we're looking at recording and getting out\".\n\n\"It's all acoustic. It's just me,\" Scott jests, before adding that nothing has changed.\n\nThey even had a couple of new songs written by drummer Eli Green that were \"sounding awesome\".\n\n\"There's no difference in what we're doing. It's still nice and brutal and heavy,\" Scott said.\n\n\"For me, it feels really good. I feel like there's a blockage gone.\"",

(Supplied: Bernard Etheridge)\n\nOriginally from England, the Etheridges started their Australian story in Scone in the Upper Hunter region.\n\nThere, Mr Etheridge's great-great-grandfather Edward worked as a butcher before moving further north to Barraba in the 1870s to open the family's first shop.\n\nIn 1946, Mr Etheridge's grandfather moved to the north west town of Gunnedah, about 75 kilometres west of Tamworth, and purchased the old bootmaker's shop that soon became Mornington Butchery.\n\nThe butchery was passed down from generation to generation, and in 1997, Mr Etheridge bought the shop from his parents and has run it since.\n\nBernard Etheridge with his parents Gus and Majella circa 2000.

        "text": "The Milano Cortina Winter Olympic Games, the 25th in the history of the Olympic movement, got underway in a delight of colour and style and celebration of music and Italian culture.\n\nA total of 1,200 performers across four venues, headlined by Mariah Carey and Andrea Bocelli in Milan's La Scala of Football, San Siro, put on a performance as gloriously spectacular as anything that the city's famous Teatro alla Scala could claim to have produced.\n\nThe future of this grand old stadium is marked, the 99-year-old site of Italian glory and despair, is set to be replaced by 2032.\n\n\"The San Siro was always full of emotions,\" former AC Milan player and manager Fabio Capello said earlier this week.\n\nThe San Siro is one of the jewels of Italian football. (Getty Images: picture aliance/Michael Kappeler)\n\n\"For me, San Siro is history. San Siro is life. San Siro is a monument.\n\n\"For the people, for the fans, it is something different.\"\n\nWinter Olympics live updates: Calls for unity at Milano Cortina opening ceremony You can also stay across the highs and lows of the Games with the ABC Sport Daily podcast and ABC Sport.\n\nHe noted that athletes should take time to look up at its towering stands when they marched and, when they surely did, they would have been greeted with a wall of sparkling lights that towered into the distinctive rafters.\n\nBut all eyes from within those stands would not have strayed from the kaleidoscope of colour and light being meted out on the stadium floor.\n\nThe choreography was immaculate, a posthumous nod to style icon Giorgio Armani with a catwalk of models in the colours of the Italian flag a particularly stylish touch ahead of a glorious rendition of the Italian national anthem.\n\nThe choreography at the opening ceremony was sensational. (Getty Images: Gregory Shamus)\n\nDiva in chief Carey stole the stage with a glorious performance of Italian classic Nel blu, dipinto di blu \u2014 yeah, that's the song better known as Volare \u2014 followed by Nothing is Impossible before her retinue came to clear her from the stage.\n\nBut Bocelli's Nessun Dorma was simply spine-tingling in its beauty and intensity, the 67-year-old's soaring vocals enveloping everyone in attendance with a shiver of deep, primal emotion that had the hairs on the back of your neck stand to attention.\n\nBut in truth, the music, whether a fantasia of operatic classics or the pumping trance that added tempo to the athlete's parade, was all as spectacular as the clean visuals.\n\nThe opening ceremony was a study of stunning colours and patterns. (Getty Images: Jared C. Tilton)\n\nThe idea of Armonia, or Harmony \u2014 the theme of this year's opening ceremony \u2014 we're told, is to bring different elements together:\n\nMilano and Cortina, city and mountain, humanity and nature. Armonia is not a compromise between opposing forces, but a dialogue between them \u2014 a necessary foundation for imagining a better future.\n\nThis ceremony was no doubt a bold, ambitious undertaking.\n\nIn keeping with the dispersed nature of these Games, the Opening Ceremony was being conducted over four venues, bringing together the two main hubs situated over 400km apart and their two satellites even deeper into the mountains.\n\nAustralia's athletes entered the Winter Olympics at four different venues. (Getty Images: Maddie Meyer)\n\nSimultaneous national anthems. Simultaneous cauldrons being lit \u2014 the Milanese one at Arco della Pace, the Arch of Peace, the Cortina one in the city's Piazza Angelo Dibona. Simultaneous parades of athletes.\n\nAlthough the sight of giant spaces behind the place holders inside the San Siro was odd at times, the director did a stellar job of transmitting the simultaneous pictures of athletes marching in Livigno, Predazzo and Cortina.\n\nIt was a joyous occasion and exactly what International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry had hoped for when she had spoken earlier in the week.\n\n\"What is keeping my faith alive is that when the opening ceremony happens and those athletes start competing, suddenly, the world remembers magic and the spirit that the Games have,\" she said.\n\n\"And they get to suddenly remember what's actually important, and they get to be inspired.\"\n\nBut Olympics do not happen in isolation.\n\nIsrael were roundly jeered when their quartet of athletes marched into the San Siro, the first reaction that was not overwhelmingly positive from the highly responsive crowd all night.\n\nUS vice President JD Vance was in Milan too, appearing almost at the right hand of Coventry.\n\nWhen he was shown on the big screen applauding the Americans, who had been mostly well received by the crowd, he was roundly booed and jeered too.\n\nJD Vance received a frosty reception. (Getty Images: Andreas Rentz)\n\nPeace was a constant, underlying theme \u2014 not unusual in Olympic opening ceremonies but coupled this year with a sense of urgency directly corresponding to the perilous state of global politics that provided such a dour backdrop to events.\n\nEven before the televised aspect got underway, the spectators in San Siro were shown a video message from UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres with a message highlighting the peaceful mission the Games could hope to achieve.\n\n\"At a time when so much of the world is divided by conflict, your very presence demonstrates that another world is possible. One of unity, respect and harmony,\" Giovanni Malag\u00f2, President of the organising committee, said in his speech.\n\nYet outside the rings of unity linking the Games hubs, protests had been taking place across the city.\n\nStudents at the Politecnico di Milano in the city's east held up placards decrying the presence of United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, known as ICE, in the city, while there have also been protests against the Israeli-Palestine conflict.\n\nStudents gathered to protest against the presence of ICE agents in Milan earlier in the day. (Getty Images: Emanuele Cremaschi)\n\nMayor Beppe Sala described ICE as \"a militia that kills\" and that the agents are \"not welcome\".\n\nRussia, of course, is not here to jeer though, banned as a result of the war in Ukraine that kicked off in earnest at the conclusion of the last Winter Olympics in Beijing and continues to rage \u2014 just a day ago, Russian military commander Lieutenant General Vladimir Alexeyev was shot multiple times in Moscow.\n\nUkraine, incidentally, got the largest cheer up to that point of anyone.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nAdd America's increasingly bold approach to both friend and foe to foreign conflicts in Sudan, Haiti, The Sahel, Myanmar and Syria, and the Olympics feels less like a welcome distraction and more like the late Lesley Nielsen's Detective Frank Drebin standing in front of a firework factory telling everyone to move on.\n\n\"We understand politics and we know we don't operate in a vacuum,\" Coventry said earlier this week.\n\n\"But our game is sport. That means keeping sport a neutral ground. A place where every athlete can compete freely, without being held back by the politics or divisions of their governments.\"\n\nWishful thinking? Or blind ignorance?\n\nEither way, may the Games begin.",

        "text": "Athletes parade across Italy, Mariah Carey ignites a historic opening ceremony, and 'Coach Snoop' makes an appearance at the curling.\n\nHere are the quick hits from the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics opening ceremony.\n\n1. Aussies makes their \u2026 entrances\n\nThe parade of athletes broke new ground with four locations used for arguably the centrepiece of any opening ceremony.\n\nThe Australians were present at all four, making their presence felt with an excitable entrance at each, as Italian DJ MACE provided the soundtrack with his signature dance music.\n\nJakara Anthony and Matt Graham carry the Australian flag in Livigno. (Getty Images: Cameron Spencer)\n\nFlag bearers Jakara Anthony and Matt Graham led the contingent at Livigno in a fitting recognition for two of our greatest Winter Olympians.\n\nAussie athletes also appeared at the San Siro, Cortina and Predazzo.\n\nThey took part in the parade at the site closest to where they will compete.\n\nThe format was designed to unite \"different places into a single, continuous narrative\".\n\n2. Carey provides international flavour\n\nMariah Carey's appearance at the San Siro wasn't kept a secret, although opinion on social media was divided as to whether she should perform at an Olympics hosted by Italy.\n\nNevertheless, the US pop star made quite the entrance in a stunning sequined dress \u2014 with feather boa details \u2014 designed by Italian Fausto Puglisi.\n\nUS pop star Mariah Carey performed at the San Siro. (AP: Natacha Pisarenko)\n\nCarey first sang in Italian, performing Domenico Modugno's 1958 song Nel blu dipinto di blu, with its famous refrain of \"Volare\".\n\nShe then moved to familiar territory with an abbreviated rendition of her ballad Nothing Is Impossible, sung in her native tongue.\n\nOpening ceremony organisers wanted Carey's performance to represent themes such as sporting spirit, harmony and colour.\n\n3. Italian president meets 'The Doctor'\n\nA fuss is always made of the arrival of a head of state at an opening ceremony, but the Milano Cortina Games did it in unique style.\n\nVia video, Italian president Sergio Mattarella travelled to the San Siro aboard one of the Milan's most iconic symbols \u2014 a Carrelli tram.\n\nMattarella first appeared in the video picking up a toy dropped by a child, but he wasn't the only well-known Italian to feature.\n\nThe tram diver was revealed to be MotoGP great Valentino Rossi, who smiled as he opened the doors for Mattarella when arriving at the San Siro.\n\nKnown as \"The Doctor\", Rossi won seven 500CC/MotoGP titles, and nine world championships across all classes.\n\n4. 'A celebration of what unites us'\n\nThe theme for the opening ceremony was Armonia, or harmony.\n\nOrganisers described the concept as \"bringing together what is different,\" and it was on show throughout a vibrant, colourful evening.\n\nWinter Olympics live updates: Calls for unity at Milano Cortina opening ceremony You can also stay across the highs and lows of the Games with the ABC Sport Daily podcast and ABC Sport.\n\nAt San Siro, a stadium that rival football teams AC Milan and Inter Milan both call home, two aerialists were very brave in performing some seriously impressive moves as the Olympic rings rose over the stadium and drew together.\n\nWe were also treated to a representation of the myth of Cupid and Psyche, as well as three giant, suspended paint tubes from which cascaded the three primary colours: yellow, red and blue.\n\nThe theme of armonia was a constant throughout the opening ceremony. (Getty Images: Jared C. Tilton)\n\nAnd that theme was further emphasised by swimming great and groundbreaking first female IOC President, Kirsty Coventry.\n\n\"Let these Games be a celebration of what unites us, of everything that makes us human,\" Coventry said in her address in Milan.\n\nAnd with the first-ever simultaneous cauldron lighting, the Milano Cortina Games were officially opened.\n\n5. 'Coach Snoop'\n\nEarlier on Friday, we finally received an answer to the age old question: is Snoop Dogg a curling fan?\n\nWearing a \"Coach Snoop\" beanie, the US rapper was among the crowd at Cortina Olympic Curling Stadium during the pre-opening ceremony competition.\n\nHe was there to watch US pair Korey Dropkin and Cory Thiesse defeat Canada's Brett Gallant and Jocelyn Peterman 7-5 in the mixed doubles competition.\n\nSnoop Dogg took to the ice at the curling competition. (Getty Images: Richard Heathcote)\n\nSnoop \u2014 who was ever-present at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics \u2014 went all out at the curling, wearing a custom jacket featuring the faces of Dropkin and Thiesse.\n\n\"Snoop Dogg's here cheering us on,\" beamed Dropkin.\n\n\"It (the jacket) was so cool. Loved it. Coach Snoop looked good today.\"\n\nSnoop Dogg cheered on the US to victory. (Getty Images: Andrew Milligan)\n\nSnoop, who was named Team USA honorary coach in December, even hit the ice after the match, getting hands-on as he learned the basics from squad members.\n\nHe also asked British competitor Bruce Mouat for a photo together.\n\n\"That was so cool,\" Mouat's mixed doubles partner Jennifer Dodds said.\n\n\"He said to Bruce he's heard about him and he knows who he is, so that was pretty cool.\n\n\"I was like, 'Snoop Dogg!', when we got out there. I was proper, like, fangirling.\"",

(Supplied)\n\nShe divided her time between Esperance on the state's south coast and Ashburton Downs, a vast Pilbara pastoral station where she worked casually as a jillaroo.\n\nOn December 10, 2025, she was mustering cattle on horseback when she began to complain of exhaustion.\n\nTiffani Phelps De Wildt had no pre-existing health complications, according to her family. (Supplied)\n\nHer colleagues sat her in the shadow of her horse, radioed her husband, and took her to the nearest road.\n\n\"Corey [her husband] came from the station and they met together on the freeway ... then he drove as fast as he possibly could to the hospital,\" Mr De Wildt said.\n\n\"She lost consciousness in the car, then he stopped, he took her out of the car and gave her CPR.\n\n\"We know she said some words in Dutch, and her husband isn't too good at Dutch.\n\n\" So nobody could hear her last words. \"\n\nSuspected heatstroke\n\nTiffani Phelps De Wildt was found unresponsive by paramedics on the Paraburdoo-Tom Price Highway, 30 kilometres from the nearest medical centre.\n\nShe was 27 years old.\n\nTiffani Phelps de Wildt had lived in Australia for six years and was recently married. (Supplied)\n\n\"What the paramedics said at the scene was that it could possibly be heatstroke,\" Mr De Wildt said.\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology recorded a maximum temperature of 44.8 degrees Celsius in Paraburdoo, the nearest town, on the day Ms Phelps De Wildt died.\n\nIt was the hottest day of December 2025.\n\n\"They advised her not to go [out], but she really wanted to go for the animals,\" Mr De Wildt said.\n\n\"My sister is who she is and she likes to be outside, and she loves the animals.\"\n\nInvestigation ongoing\n\nWorkSafe is investigating the incident, a process that can take up to two years.\n\nWA Police said it was not treating Ms De Wildt's death as suspicious, but it was preparing a report for the coroner.\n\nAshburton Downs could not be reached for comment.\n\nTiffani Phelps De Wildt's brother says she was a keen horseback rider who adored animals. (Supplied)\n\nMr De Wildt said an initial autopsy was done, but further testing was set to occur in the coming months.\n\nMost of her remains were released to her family, who travelled to WA to hold a funeral shortly before Christmas Day.\n\n\"The ashes are split in half, so half of it stays in Australia, because she moved there and she really liked the country, the freedom that you guys have there.\n\n\" We don't want to take all of her back home. \"\n\nEveryone susceptible to heat\n\nMs Phelps De Wildt's death has not been reported in the Australian media until now.\n\n\"If she told us that she was going out on such a hot day, we would obviously rule against it, like her colleagues also did,\" Mr De Wildt said.\n\nHe said more should be done to protect workers vulnerable to extreme temperatures.\n\nHow to avoid heatstroke and when to call Triple Zero Extreme heat forecast for the next few days has prompted warnings form health experts. Here's how to stay safe.\n\nSt John WA acting head of medicine Andy Bell called Ms Phelps De Wildt's death an \"absolute tragedy\".\n\n\"This is a classic case of somebody who was working in a very, very hot environment; they were displaying signs and symptoms of heat-related illness,\" he said.\n\n\"And because of the tyranny of distance ... particularly in rural Western Australia, it's very, very difficult for people to get to the help that they need in a timeframe that would be most appropriate.\n\n\" This was a young, fit, healthy woman, and she was still susceptible to this type of environment. \"\n\nAndy Bell warns it is not just the very young and old who are vulnerable to heat stress. (ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\nNo 'tools down' temperature\n\nSafe Farms WA chief executive Stephen Brown said a sudden death such as Ms Phelps De Wildt's was felt across the agricultural sector.\n\n\"All the workers, all her friends, her family, wherever they may be, and the word gets out to other stations and it just ripples right across the whole industry,\" he said.\n\nMr Brown said more should be done to educate people about heat.\n\n\"A dry, hot heat of 45 degrees, which is measured on a back verandah, is a lot different to 45 degrees out in a paddock, or out on a pastoral station somewhere, with the sun beating down on you,\" he said.\n\nStephen Brown says a \"tools down\" temperature should be considered. (ABC News: Keana Naughton)\n\nEarlier this month, the Australian Council of Trade Unions issued a call for national safety rules that require employers to stop or change duties when temperatures reach dangerous levels.\n\nMr Brown said while a blanket policy might be impractical, a responsibility to assess the risks remained.\n\n\"The building industry has it in Perth, the wharfies have it, [it] gets to a certain temperature and it's down tools for the day,\" he said.\n\n\"Not quite that simple in agriculture, I appreciate, but I think there has to be a temperature when the risk is just too great to the farm owner, farm manager or pastoral lease owner and also to the workers.\"\n\nA 'wonderful' sister remembered\n\nIt comes as parts of WA's north continue to face brutal heat, with a severe heatwave in place until Sunday for the Gascoyne and Central West.\n\nMr De Wildt said he hoped his sister's story might help others facing tough conditions and that her memory would have a lasting impact.\n\n\"Tiffani ... was a wonderful person,\" he said.\n\n\"She has a really kind smile, one of those that when you when you see her, you smile yourself.\n\n\" She loved everything that lives. \"",

        "text": "After joining a gym to boost his confidence, Jackson Mackay, nine, is aiming for a second world record deadlift title just 18 months after he first started weightlifting.\n\nIn January, the Sunshine Coast boy claimed a world record with an 80-kilogram deadlift, beating the previous record of 72 kilograms.\n\n\"I can't believe I just beat a world record. That's insane, I never thought it would come to this,\" he said.\n\nKids World Records verified footage of the lift and awarded the Heaviest Deadlift Title in its boys' 7-9-year-old category.\n\nThe Twin Waters local said his desire to achieve a weightlifting goal was initially sudden.\n\n\"I just woke up and\u2026 because I was at the gym, I'm like, 'Well, gyms are for weights, so I'm gonna break a world record,'\" Jackson said.\n\nHe trained three hours a week for 18 months, initially using a hex bar designed to build core stability before claiming the record with a standard straight bar.\n\nJackson achieved the world record with the support of his coach, Joshua Hodges (left), and his mother and father, Cara and Brett Mackay.

        "text": "US President Donald Trump has given his \"total endorsement\" of Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi ahead of Japan's national elections, adding he would meet her at the White House on March 19.\n\nJapan's first female premier, whose coalition is widely expected to win, is seeking a public mandate for spending plans that have rattled investors, and a defence build-up that could further strain relations with China.\n\nMs Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party and its partner, the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, could capture \u2060around 300 seats in the 465-seat lower house of parliament, the polls show, well up from the razor-thin majority they now control.\n\nFear of 'silent invasion' by foreigners in Japan spurs far-right popularity The once fringe Sanseito has become the fourth largest opposition party in parliament by pushing a nationalist \"Japanese First\" agenda.\n\n\"Prime Minister Takaichi is someone who deserves powerful recognition for the job she and her Coalition are doing,\" Mr Trump posted on his Truth Social platform on Thursday.\n\n\"Therefore, as President of the United States of America, it is my Honor to give \u200ba Complete and Total Endorsement of her, and what her highly respected Coalition is representing.\"\n\nOne of Ms Takaichi's first engagements after she was elevated to prime minister in October was to host Trump in Tokyo.\n\nShe gave him a putter used by \u200bhis \u2060former golfing buddy, the late Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe.\n\nAnalysts say Donald Trump's endorsement of Sanae Takaichi signals a growing pattern of aligning with right-wing leaders abroad. (Reuters: Evelyn Hockstein, file)\n\nLauded by Mr Trump for breaking Japan's glass ceiling, Ms Takaichi pledged billions of dollars in investments in a meeting analysts said helped underline the strength of the Japan-US alliance.\n\nWeeks later, however, she touched off the biggest diplomatic dispute with China in over a decade by publicly outlining how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan.\n\nTrump has asked Takaichi not to anger China\n\nMr Trump, who is \u200cseeking to maintain a fragile trade truce with China, asked Ms Takaichi in a private phone call in November not to further aggravate Beijing, sources told Reuters.\n\nA resounding victory could \u200bhand Ms Takaichi new clout in the dispute with China, current and former Japanese officials said, though Beijing has shown no signs of backing down.\n\nMs Takaichi's plans to strengthen Japan's defences will likely also draw more anger from Beijing, which has cast her endeavours as an attempt to \u200brevive Japan's past \u200dmilitarism.\n\nThe long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition is expected to win Sunday's election. (AP: Louise Delmotte)\n\nWhile the row with China is \u2060starting to weigh on the world's fourth-largest economy, it has hardly dented Ms Takaichi's high approval ratings.\n\nShe has even become an unlikely idol for some voters, who have been buying up the bag she carries and the pink pen she scribbles with in parliament.\n\nTurnout among young supporters, who tend to vote less than older cohorts, could help determine the margin of a Takaichi victory.\n\nHow one comment sparked threats against Japan's PM Sanae Takaichi has been in the top job for less than a month, but her comments detailing what Japan could do if China invaded Taiwan has sparked a diplomatic war.\n\nRecord snowfall in some parts of the country could \u200calso crimp turnout.\n\nIf the polls have it all wrong, and Ms Takaichi loses her majority, she has said she will resign.\n\nMs Takaichi \"has already proven to be a strong, powerful and wise Leader, and one that truly loves her \u2060country,\" Mr Trump said in his endorsement.\n\nThe US president has increasingly sought to shape foreign elections.\n\nHe backed Argentine President Javier Milei, highlighting US financial support as a factor in Mr Milei's 2025 legislative success.\n\nOn Thursday, he endorsed Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for a vote there in April.\n\nAnalysts say such interventions signal a growing pattern of aligning with right-wing leaders abroad.\n\nReuters",

Another festival of sport without Russia or Belarus.\n\nAs was the case in Paris two years ago, there will be no sign of the Russian or Belarusian flag, name or colours at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nBut there will be a handful of athletes with Russian or Belarusian passports competing in northern Italy.\n\nWhy was Russia banned from the Olympics?\n\nRussia was banned from the Olympics in October 2023, 20 months after the invasion of Ukraine that took place in the days after the Beijing Winter Olympics.\n\nBelarus, due to the country's support of Russia's war, was also banned.\n\nThe principal reason for the ban was not the war specifically, although the IOC did recommend that individual sporting organisations suspend Russia in March 2022.\n\nIt was actually when the Russian Olympic Committee took over sporting organisations in several regions within Ukraine, such as Donetsk, Kherson and Luhansk, that the IOC confirmed the ban.\n\nThat constituted \"a breach of the Olympic Charter because it violates the territorial integrity of the NOC [National Olympic Committee] of Ukraine\", according to the IOC.\n\nWasn't Russia called something else in Beijing?\n\nTennis players Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider (front) had to wear bland uniforms, devoid of national colours in Paris. (Getty Images: DeFodi Images/Tnani Badreddine)\n\nIn Tokyo in 2021 and at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes competed under the moniker ROC.\n\nROC stands for Russian Olympic Committee, and Russian athletes were allowed to represent the committee, even though they could not represent their own country.\n\nThat acronym was used due to a long-running state doping scandal that further intensified at those Games after the positive test of 15-year-old figure skater Kamila Valieva.\n\nRussia sent 200 athletes to the 2022 Beijing Winter Games under the ROC moniker, winning 32 medals, including five golds.\n\nWhat is the AIN at the Winter Olympics?\n\nAIN stands for Athl\u00e8tes Individuels Neutres, which in English is Individual Neutral Athletes.\n\nThe AIN is the name used to represent approved Russian and Belarusian athletes at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nIt is the same designation that approved athletes from those two countries were given at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nThere, 32 athletes competed, winning a gold, three silvers and a bronze medal.\n\nThose athletes are banned from using the neutral Olympic flag and Olympic anthem, which has been used in the past for neutral athletes.\n\nIt will, instead, use a flag depicting a circular AIN emblem and a one-off instrumental anthem that has been assigned by the IOC.\n\nWhich Russian or Belarusian athletes are eligible?\n\nFigure skater Adeliia Petrosian, of Russia, will perform as an individual neutral athlete at the Milano Cortina Games. (Getty Images: Anadolu/Sefa Karacan)\n\nA total of 20 athletes will compete under the AIN banner at these Games; 13 from Russia and seven from Belarus.\n\nThey cannot compete in team events, the IOC justifiably stating that individuals cannot be part of a team, which rules out ice hockey, curling and the team figure skating events.\n\nThe \"principles of participation\" state that only athletes who have \"not acted against the peace mission\" of the IOC \"by actively supporting the war\" will be invited.\n\nThe BBC conducted an investigation that suggested four of the Russian athletes cleared to compete have, in fact, breached the terms laid out by the IOC, either by being members of the Russian armed forces or by liking pro-War material online.\n\nThe athletes have to be approved by their sport's governing body, so FIS for skiing, ISU for ice skating events, the FIL for luge and the ISMF for skimo.\n\nThey are then vetted by an IOC-appointed panel.\n\nHere is the list:\n\nRussia:\n\nYulia Pleshkova \u2014 Alpine skiing\n\nSimon Efimov \u2014 Alpine skiing\n\nSavelii Korostelev \u2014 cross-country skiing\n\nDaria Nepriaeva \u2014 cross-country skiing\n\nPetr Gumennik \u2014 figure skating\n\nAdeliia Petrosian \u2014 figure skating\n\nDaria Olesik \u2014 luge\n\nPavel Repilov \u2014 luge\n\nIvan Posashkov \u2014 short-track\n\nAlena Krylova \u2014 short-track\n\nNikita Filippov \u2014 ski mountaineering\n\nKseniia Korzhova \u2014 speed skating\n\nAnastasiia Semenova \u2014 speed skating\n\nBelarus:\n\nMarina Zueva \u2014 speed skating\n\nHanna Karaliova \u2014 cross-country skiing\n\nViktoriya Safonova \u2014 figure skating\n\nMaria Shkanova \u2014 Alpine skiing\n\nAnastasiya Andryianava \u2014 freestyle skiing\n\nAnna Derugo \u2014 freestyle skiing\n\nHanna Huskova \u2014 freestyle skiing\n\nRussian athletes took FIS to court to compete\n\nDaria Olesik fought a legal challenge to be able to compete. (Getty Images: Carmen Mandato)\n\nOnly a handful of Russians and Belarusians have been invited to compete in skiing events, but even that number is controversial.\n\nSkiing governing body, the FIS \u2014 which oversees Alpine, Nordic and freestyle skiing as well as snowboarding events at the Games, 57 of the 116 medal events \u2014 had banned all Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing in sanctioned events since February 2022 and renewed the ban in October last year.\n\nHowever, Russia appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) which overturned the ban on December 2.\n\nThe FIL (International Luge Federation) had also issued a blanket ban on athletes from those countries but had that overturned by CAS\n\nSports bodies had justified the exclusion of Russians for security reasons, to protect athletes and prevent protests that also could disrupt events.\n\nAre Russia ever going to come back into the Olympic fold?\n\nYou'd argue it will be inevitable at some point, not least since FIFA president Gianni Infantino said the ban on Russia competing in football should \"definitely\" be lifted, \"at least at youth level\".\n\nInfantino told Sky News that the ban had \"not achieved anything\" and \"created more frustration, and hatred.\"\n\nThat was described by Matvii Bidnyi, Ukraine's sports minister, as \"irresponsible\" and \"infantile\".\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\n\"They detach football from the reality in which children are being killed,\" he said.\n\n\"Let me remind you that since the start of Russia's full-scale aggression, more than 650 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed by Russians.\"\n\nNevertheless, this came after a recommendation from the Olympic Summit that international sports federations allow Russian teams and athletes to compete under their national flag at youth level.\n\nAnd IOC president Kirsty Coventry said sport should be a \"neutral ground\" where athletes can \"compete freely, without being held back by politics\".\n\nHowever, she also noted that \"the October 2023 decision [to suspend Russia and Belarus] still stands. We have kept in place the neutral athletes' status, as per Paris, and that decision has not been spoken about in the last couple of weeks\".",

Got it Share A A A\n\nLawyers are reporting a surge in requests for advice about separation and divorce after the summer holidays, as couples emerge from extended periods together resolving to part ways. Jodylee Bartal, an accredited specialist in family law and a principal solicitor at Melbourne firm KHQ Lawyers, said she typically observed a \u201cspike\u201d in requests for advice about divorce in December, \u201cjust before Christmas, and in January\u201d. Requests for advice about separation and divorce increase after summer, lawyers say. Monique Westermann This year, the trend ramped up. Bartal said new client enquiries in family law matters in January more than tripled the December figure. One new client had received a \u201crather unexpected letter from her ex\u2019s lawyer on December 24 and needed urgent advice about property, parenting and child support matters\u201d, she said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother client had agreed with his wife that their marriage was at an end and to separate under the same roof but to \u201cdelay telling the kids\u201d. \u201cIt \u2018blew up\u2019 over the holidays,\u201d Bartal said. Related Article Sex & relationships More baggage, fewer expectations: How Gen X is redefining love in midlife \u201cPeople get to the end of the calendar year and think about what they want to bring into the new year. \u201cFinancial pressures are often a trigger for conflict. There is also the stress of managing the care of kids over the almost seven-week break and work commitments.\u201d Bartal said that \u201cfor the more complex financial matters, such as where there are businesses involved, December and January makes sense from a financial reporting point of view\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFourth-quarter financials are in, [and] six months of data gives a pretty good indication of the likely end of financial year results. \u201cThe parties think, sometimes optimistically, they have six months to negotiate an in-principle agreement and \u2018close out\u2019 their financial relationship by the end of financial year.\u201d She said couples or individuals thinking about separating from their partner needed to consider issues such as strategies for separating safely, whether they \u201cshould move out or is it better to stay in the house\u201d, and interim financial and parenting arrangements. Under Australian family law, couples must have been separated for at least 12 months before they can apply for a divorce. It is possible to be separated while living under the same roof, but there may be safety and other considerations. Court filings\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe increase in requests for advice about divorce in the New Year is not reflected in court filings in January due to the lag between starting the separation process and filing an application for divorce in the Federal Circuit and Family Court. Court registries and law firms also shut down in late December to early January. A monthly breakdown of divorce applications filed between 2021 and January, supplied by the Federal Circuit and Family Court, reveals applications for divorce have been relatively steady in January over the past six years. This year, 3381 applications were filed, compared with 3449 last year. The 2021-25 figures show divorce applications increased each February compared with the previous month. Last year, applications peaked in July and August, at 4345 and 4272 respectively, and decreased towards the end of the year, ending with 3265 in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Divorce season\u2019 Hayder Shkara, principal of Justice Family Lawyers, said: \u201cWhat makes January different is not that relationships suddenly fail, but that people finally feel able, emotionally and practically, to act on decisions they\u2019ve been sitting with for some time. \u201cWhile there isn\u2019t a single official dataset that labels January as \u2018divorce season,\u2019 there is a well-recognised and consistent trend across the family law sector that enquiries ... spike in the first quarter of the year, particularly in January and February.\u201d Hayder said that \u201cin the last week of January, our office was contacted by a parent who had stayed in an unhappy relationship through Christmas so their children could enjoy the holidays\u201d. \u201cWithin days of school returning, they moved out of the family home and urgently sought advice because there were no agreed arrangements in place for the children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cJanuary was the point where living in limbo became unworkable and the need for formal advice became immediate.\u201d Michael Tiyce, principal of Sydney law firm Tiyce & Lawyers, said his firm often saw \u201cpeaks in enquiry after long periods of time that people have spent together\u201d, such as after school holidays and when COVID lockdowns were lifted. Tiyce said \u201cunderlying tensions and issues come to a head when people are spending more time together\u201d. \u201cOften people are consuming more alcohol, and sometimes other substances, which can lead to frayed tempers,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other cases, people simply come to the realisation that they have had enough and that it is time to bring the relationship to a close.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Sunday Life Do you need a midlife coach? The professionals helping to answer life\u2019s big questions Tiyce said that \u201cwhile we always provide people with details for therapy or counselling, which some take up and others choose not to, following these sorts of periods we make a point of ensuring that people are clear that they are making a final decision\u201d. \u201cIt should not be a decision made simply out of exhaustion caused by changed routines or environments. \u201cThis is particularly important given the significant impact such a decision will have on their own lives, as well as on the lives of their spouse or partner and any children involved.\u201d An application for divorce must be filed in court. Other issues between the parties such as parenting arrangements and property division can be settled outside court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf couples do decide to separate,\u201d Tiyce said, \u201cthey should expect to receive very clear advice from their family lawyer that the matter should be negotiated and, where possible, resolved through negotiation or mediation. \u201cIt is now very unusual for parties to simply proceed directly to the Family Court. There are rules governing why that cannot or should not occur, but as a matter of practicality, the cost \u2013 both financial and emotional \u2013 and the level of stress and conflict involved in litigation are so great that people should do everything they reasonably can to avoid it.\u201d",

Kate Geraghty\n\nMost mornings, Joyce and a group of half a dozen women descend upon Gulargambone\u2019s Alan Walker Memorial Baths to swim laps and catch up on what\u2019s been happening in town.\n\nThe sign welcoming visitors to Gulargambone (pronounced \u201cGoolaa-gam-bone\u201d but known as Gular to locals) says 503 people live here, but Newton says it is fewer these days. The town lost its cypress mill in the 2000s and, when the workers moved away to find other jobs, so did their families.\n\n\u201cA lot of the women are widows, and it\u2019s their time that they spend with other people, instead of being home alone all day long,\u201d Joyce says. \u201cWe just enjoy each other\u2019s company and do whatever exercise we need to do.\u201d\n\nJust as Sydney flocks to its beaches and ocean baths, the public swimming pool sits at the heart of regional towns like Gulargambone. The Herald\u2019s chief photographer, Kate Geraghty, has spent the summer travelling to these pools, documenting the daily routines of the people who rely on them for exercise, social connection and relief from the brutal summer heat.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe first time I read the words \u201cOzempic face\u201d I clicked, genuinely alarmed by the implication that this class of drug might be disfiguring its users. I was relieved to find nothing pointing to actual harm, especially given how many people in my immediate circle had started taking it. But the relief was short-lived. \u201cOzempic neck\u201d is not a medical issue. Getty Images As the months rolled on, my feeds filled with articles, TikToks and Instagram posts with disparaging descriptions of facial changes resulting from the use of GLP-1s; a class of drug originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, now also prescribed for weight management. Words like \u201csagging\u201d, \u201chollow\u201d, and \u201cdeflated\u201d suddenly dominated the discourse around the drugs. And the \u201cconcerns\u201d seemed to be migrating south, as \u201cOzempic neck\u201d entered the chat, along with mention of \u201cOzempic arms\u201d and \u201cOzempic butt\u201d popping up in mainstream reporting. Conversations about aesthetic changes linked to GLP-1 medications have been growing online since the term \u201cOzempic face\u201d entered the lexicon around early 2023, finding a comfortable home in a TikTok ecosystem where Ozempic-related content has amassed hundreds of millions of views. Unsurprisingly, much of the chatter comes from the pages of cosmetic surgeons offering expensive and invasive procedures as a \u201cfix\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what doesn\u2019t seem to be catching on is the fact that these changes are not, strictly speaking, a medical side effect, or a formal diagnosis. They\u2019re a purely aesthetic observation \u2013 one that is by no means unique to taking GLP-1 medication. Related Article Medicine \u2018Not for human consumption\u2019: Warning to Australians injecting bootlegged weight-loss drug Phrases like \u201cOzempic neck\u201d, or \u201cOzempic face\u201d might imply an air of medical legitimacy, but they\u2019re media buzzwords working to draw conversation away from anything medical and back to the real heart of the issue \u2013 physical attractiveness. These biting critiques really give away the game for those who purport to be concerned only about the health of those taking the drugs for weight loss. I would suggest that gawking at those whose bodies are changing rapidly on the drugs does nothing to improve their health. And absurd as this nomadic \u201cconcern\u201d might be, it shows the speed at which we\u2019re careening ever closer to a world where a person\u2019s appearance is all that matters. Singling out Ozempic also implies the drug is uniquely \u201cdisfiguring\u201d, which is inaccurate. Looser skin, facial volume loss, and changes to the neck can happen with any significant or rapid weight loss, and in some cases, the natural ageing process. But that doesn\u2019t matter when the point is to frame bodily changes as failures, and to reinforce the idea that people in bigger bodies MUST lose weight, but not too fast! And certainly not in a way that shows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, this is nothing new. It\u2019s something people living in marginalised bodies have been dealing with forever, repackaged for the algorithm age: concern-trolling dressed up as clinical concern. And given these online spaces thrive on a combination of impossible beauty standards and body scrutiny (at least 500,000 Aussies are taking GLP-1s and climbing), we will no doubt have a new body part to nitpick within the month. Related Article Weight loss Game changing weight-loss drugs need to be taken for life, or health benefits are lost To be clear, this is not some new brand of stigma now targeting thin bodies. It\u2019s an extension of the stigma that people in bigger bodies face in almost every corner of our culture. What we\u2019re seeing now is a kind of unapologetic admission that we really, truly don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s furry behind about the health of people in larger bodies; we care about the way they look. Indeed, if your body is deemed \u201cunhealthy\u201d due to its size, we offer a barrage of stigma and shame with a few \u201chelpful\u201d weight loss suggestions thrown in. If you lose weight quickly with medication or otherwise, we go about scrutinising your face, neck, arms and butt for \u201cdamage\u201d. And perhaps most galling (and least surprising) is the pace at which clinics and specialists are jumping to offer fixes ... for a price. You might call it concern. You might call it a side effect. But in the end, it\u2019s the same worn out permission slip to condemn fat bodies, with a checkout link attached.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChanging bodies remain season for public scrutiny, and when drastic weight changes are involved, cruelty becomes acceptable, even marketable. Let\u2019s be honest. That\u2019s not \u201cconcern for health\u201d, is it? It\u2019s punishment for losing weight the \u201cwrong\u201d way.

Got it Share A A A\n\nFrom the boundary fence of her dairy farm in western Victoria, Janet Rogerson can see a scorched treeline from bushfires on the horizon of a neighbouring property. The charred trees are a reminder that the Carlisle River fires, although not currently a threat, are still burning in the Otways and could pose a danger to nearby communities if conditions take a turn for the worse. But Rogerson\u2019s worries about safety extend far beyond the flames. Janet Rogerson on her farm just outside of Simpson in western Victoria. Nicole Cleary During electricity outages, Rogerson routinely loses mobile coverage, as do many other residents in the small town of Simpson and its surrounds. It is a problem plaguing regional and rural communities across Victoria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the catastrophic fire danger day on January 9, Rogerson, who is a Telstra customer, said she lost mobile service. She was unable to make calls or access data to check the Vic Emergency app. \u201cMy elderly dad was trying to ring me to find out what was happening with the fires,\u201d she said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t get through to me.\u201d Rogerson said she lost Telstra network coverage a second time later in the month. Mobile towers in the town of Simpson. Nicole Cleary \u201cThey\u2019re happy to take our premium payments but not so happy to help us out when we need them in an emergency, which is very disappointing,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFellow Simpson resident and community centre co-ordinator Debra Smith became so fed up with the regular mobile network outages that she eventually took it to the top and emailed Telstra\u2019s chief executive, Vicki Brady. \u201cAnd I still got nowhere,\u201d Smith said. Simpson is served by Telstra and Optus towers. During Telstra outages, customers can supposedly access coverage on the Optus tower. But that only allows SOS calls, not data. Debra Smith is raising the alarm about mobile network failures. Nicole Cleary When the Telstra network fails and customers are not within range of an Optus tower, Smith says they lose mobile connection altogether. It means they cannot call Triple Zero or notify authorities in the case of a car accident or other emergencies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt could be life-threatening,\u201d Smith said. Smith noticed the problem was getting worse in 2019 and has made numerous attempts to work with Telstra to rectify the issue. \u201cThe bulk of people in this area are with Telstra because it does have superior coverage out here,\u201d she said. RMIT electronics and telecommunications engineering associate professor Mark Gregory agrees the regular mobile coverage failures are a serious and worsening problem. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more events like fires, floods and heat, and we\u2019ve got more outages occurring,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGregory said other links in the telecommunications chain were also problematic, including telephone exchanges. He argued that regulations governing when telecommunications companies must keep customers and the public notified about major and significant local outages were too weak. The Australian Communications and Media Authority defines a major outage as one that affects or is likely to affect 100,000 or more services or all carriage services using the network in a state or territory and is expected to last at least 60 minutes. It defines a significant local outage as one that affects 250 or more services in remote Australia and is expected to last at least three hours. A significant local outage is also one affecting at least 1000 services in regional Australia and is expected to last six or more hours. Gregory said telecommunications companies should have to report all outages so they were held accountable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll outages are important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s big or small \u2013 people can\u2019t call Triple Zero.\u201d The Carlisle River fire has caused extensive damage and is still burning. Justin McManus In the north Victorian town of Euroa, power outages resulting in mobile phone coverage losses are an ongoing problem. Euroa Chamber of Business and Commerce president Stephanie Swift said regular mobile outages were dangerous and disrupted the town\u2019s ability to trade, particularly for retailers. \u201cIt\u2019s getting pretty dire here,\u201d she said. A Telstra spokesperson said the company understood the importance of telecommunications during the recent bushfires that had affected Simpson and Euroa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen fires like this occur, power outages and extreme heat are the main causes of network interruptions, with some infrastructure also being damaged due to the conditions,\u201d the spokesperson said. Firefighters putting out spot fires on the Colac-Lavers Hill road. Nearby residents are concerned the fire danger is still not over. Justin McManus They said Telstra had back-up power systems at most sites and some key locations had fixed generators. The company said that in the recent fires, restoration efforts were hampered by blocked roads and safety exclusion zones that impeded access to damaged infrastructure. The federal government has introduced legislation to establish the Universal Outdoor Mobile Obligation, which will require network operators to provide outdoor mobile voice and text coverage nationwide. A federal government spokesperson said the obligation would be achieved partly through \u201csatellite direct-to-device technology\u201d. It is set to commence in December next year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMobile network failures are a common occurrence in Simpson. Nicole Cleary But Victorian Liberal MP Richard Riordan, whose Polwarth electorate covers south-west Victoria, said phone towers across high-risk fire zones must be upgraded to have battery and diesel generator back-up. \u201cOur community is now highly reliant on mobile and internet connection for safety, work and home use,\u201d he said. \u201cCity communities would not tolerate prolonged outages, and nor do regional communities.\u201d He said communities in the Otways could have tens of thousands of visitors from cities and overseas travelling through high-danger flood and fire areas, and they relied on mobile communications for safety. A spokeswoman for Powercor, which covers south-west Victoria, said the company\u2019s crews worked quickly to restore electricity during extreme weather events, but critical infrastructure providers were encouraged to have their own power supply.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJanet Rogerson says locals are now hoping for rain. Nicole Cleary Janet Rogerson said many people in her community were still on edge with fires burning nearby and the prospect of more hot weather. \u201cSummer\u2019s not over yet,\u201d she said. In the absence of reliable mobile coverage, Rogerson said only one thing would bring relief to many exhausted people in her community. That\u2019s rain and plenty of it.

It\u2019s just one way he\u2019s working to keep the language and te ao Maori (Maori culture) alive in his Brisbane household. Brisbane-based father-of-three Tangaroa Hau-Hadfield has one rule in the car: the kids can only speak Te Reo Maori. Brittney Deguara \u201c[We\u2019re] grateful to be able to practise our culture here in another country because it\u2019s a lost culture, a lost language, and so it\u2019s our responsibility to get that back for us and for our kids.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike many of the almost 10,000 Kiwis who moved to Queensland in the last financial year, Hau-Hadfield came across the Tasman Sea in search of a better lifestyle. He left Hokianga in Aotearoa/New Zealand\u2019s far north over a decade ago to work in Australia\u2019s mining industry. He then met his wife, and they welcomed three tamariki (children). However, it took him five years to find his Brisbane whanau (family). That emerged as the competitive kapa haka group Te Kapa Haka o Te Kahu Ariki, based in Eagleby. \u201cWe always say we\u2019re more than a kapa haka group, it\u2019s more so a family \u2013 we know what makes each other tick, what makes each other happy,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis time last year, my partner and I were talking about moving back to New Zealand, and the only real thing that kept us here was our kapa haka group. That\u2019s the commitment and the ties that we have to these people, and I\u2019m happy that we chose to stay.\u201d The group formed in Brisbane three years ago to \u201ckeep our culture alive\u201d, said leader Andre Ahipene. Te Kahu Ariki are busy preparing for the upcoming 10th Australian Maori Kapa Haka Festival. Te Kahu Ariki \u201cWhen one practises who they truly are through tradition and through culture, you become closer to the land in which you live on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifestyle. \u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate and privileged that our mana whenua \u2013 the people of this land, our Indigenous peoples \u2013 really support our consistency and being able to practise who we are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCo-leader Gaylene Ahipene added: \u201cTo have someone [who] understands you, to speak the same language, to think the same thoughts \u2026 it helps us really stay connected, not only to ourselves but to one another, and in this world that we live in, it helps us be very grounded.\u201d The couple moved to Brisbane almost two decades ago to \u201chave a break\u201d from their world. But just days after they arrived, they found themselves doing haka. Gaylene and Andre Ahipene are the head tutors and founders of Te Kahu Ariki, a Brisbane-based kapa haka group. Te Kahu Ariki \u201cIt was inevitable that haka was never going to let us get away from who we truly are. This is truly ... a lifestyle. We would not be as healthy, as well, and as vibrant as we are \u2013 fit and able \u2013 if we didn\u2019t have haka in our life. I think we would seize up,\u201d Andre said. \u201cHaka has been our oranga, our fountain of youth, and the spring in our step in life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group is in the thick of rehearsals for the upcoming 10th Australian Maori Kapa Haka Festival, taking place on the Gold Coast at the end of March. They will be one of nine groups vying for the chance to compete in the largest traditional Maori performing arts celebration in the world, Te Matatini 2027 in Waikato. Te Kahu Ariki are one of nine Australian kapa haka groups competing in this year\u2019s event on the Gold Coast. Te Kahu Ariki \u201cThat would be life-changing, especially for our members as well, they\u2019ve worked so hard here, but to actually go home and stand on your own whenua [land], to perform with your own people, it just takes it that whole other step higher,\u201d Gaylene said during a Sunday rehearsal. \u201cThat would be our kapa, our members, our ropu [group] retracing their ancestral steps home,\u201d Andre added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLarge-scale opportunities like this for Maori living in Brisbane to connect are rare. Andre hopes developmental conferences and language retreats will become more frequent, as many Maori come to Queensland for better employment opportunities and to \u201cget ahead in life\u201d. \u201cWhat I believe would mobilise us extremely would be opportunities to come together and unite, so our people can consistently find us,\u201d he said. But for Hau-Hadfield and the Ahipenes, the continuation of te ao Maori in Brisbane is for their children. \u201cThey just come in the space and they\u2019re sponges, they pick things up just as fast as we do \u2013 or probably even faster,\u201d Hau-Hadfield explained. \u201c[We\u2019ve] had our four children here, it\u2019s evolution \u2013 we\u2019re evolving with the time, and we\u2019re just bringing our babies along,\u201d Gaylene said.

        "text": "The average wage in Australia is $1,611.10 a week, but this figure can change dramatically depending on where you live, your sex and occupation.\n\nEmployee Earnings and Hours data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 23 January reveals which workers are the most highly paid and how wages vary by state.\n\nThe business survey was conducted in May last year and is completed every two years. The average wage figure includes people working part-time and full-time, as well as those in managerial roles.\n\nExcluding part-time workers and managerial staff \u2014 who have strategic responsibilities or oversee a significant number of employees \u2014 the survey found the average weekly wage for a full-time worker in Australia is $2,061 before tax.\n\nThe state with the highest average wage is the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), where full-time workers earn an average of $2,206 a week. This drops to $1,784 in Tasmania.\n\nWhen you exclude high-level managerial staff, workers in WA have the highest average wages for full-time adult employees in Australia.\n\nThe data also shows which Australian workers are earning more or less based on their industry and gender.\n\nMen employed in the mining industry are on average the highest-earning full-time workers, bringing home $3,319 a week.\n\nThe most highly paid women in the country are also those working in mining, earning an average of $2,750 a week.\n\nMen and women working in the mining industry earn on average the highest wages in Australia.\n\nThe most highly paid workers\n\nThat picture changes slightly when you look at specific occupations.\n\nThe highest-paid occupations in Australia \u2014 based on average weekly earnings for all employees \u2014 are anaesthetists, who earn $5,366 on average before tax, followed by surgeons on $4,159 and engineering managers on $3,939.\n\nAnaesthetists are the highest-paid workers in Australia based on average weekly earnings for all employees. Source: SBS News\n\nAverage wage data can be skewed by a few exceptionally high earners whose income can push the average higher. It's also important to note that these figures include part-time workers, who earn considerably less than full-time workers.\n\nThe data can also be broken down by gender, but there are some limitations to this, as it is not available for every occupation (anaesthetists are not included, for example).\n\nOf the occupations that do provide a breakdown, among women, the highest earners are engineering managers, who earn an average weekly wage of $3,818, and surgeons, who earn $3,752. They are followed by \"commissioned officers (management)\" \u2014 those employed in high-ranking positions in the defence forces, fire and police services \u2014 on $3,605.\n\nEngineering managers are the highest paid women on average. Source: Getty / chain45154\n\nAmong men, \"other medical practitioners\" takes the top spot with an average income of $4,990 a week. This is a category that includes dermatologists, emergency medicine specialists, obstetricians, gynaecologists, ophthalmologists, pathologists and radiologists.\n\nThey are followed by surgeons on $4,486, and commissioned officers (management) on $3,990.\n\nSBS News has created a searchable database, showing average wages for specific occupations. The figures include both part-time and full-time workers. Enter your occupation below to explore.\n\nGender pay gap is closing\n\nWhile average weekly earnings for different occupations appear to show a stark difference in what men and women are being paid, ABS head of labour statistics Sean Crick says comparing hourly pay is more useful when looking at the gender pay gap because women are more likely to work part-time than men.\n\nAcross all professions, men earned $50 an hour on average, while women earned $46.\n\nThe gender pay gap in May 2025 was 8.4 per cent, a 0.5 percentage point improvement on the figure two years prior, when it was 8.9 per cent.\n\nHow wages change depending on your state and age\n\nIncluding part-time workers, the ABS survey found those employed in the ACT have the highest average wage, earning $1,821 a week before tax.\n\nThose aged 45 to 54 in the ACT are the most highly paid age group in Australia, earning on average $2,456 a week, while those aged 20 years and younger in the territory are the fourth lowest earners, bringing home $497 on average.\n\nTasmania is the state or territory with the lowest average wage overall, with employees earning around $1,389 a week.\n\nBut the demographic with the lowest average wage in the country is South Australians aged 20 years and younger, who are paid around $464 per week.\n\nWorkers in the ACT are the highest paid employees in Australia. Source: SBS News\n\nNon-managerial staff exclude high-level managers with strategic responsibilities or who oversee a significant number of employees. Source: SBS News\n\nIt can also be helpful to look at median wages when seeking to understand what a typical Australian earns. The median wage is the middle value in a list of incomes ranging from lowest to highest \u2014 so half of all people earn more than that figure, and half earn less.\n\nIn Australia, the median wage is $1,436 a week \u2014 $1,674 for men and $1,250 for women. This includes both full and part-time workers.\n\nYou can find out more information about where your wages sits compared to others in the interactive below, which has been based on data from the latest ABS release on Characteristics of Employment, August 2025.\n\nInteractive design by Ken Macleod\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "If things feel like they're getting more expensive, that's because they are.\n\nNew data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) shows living costs rose for all household types in the year to the December 2025 quarter, with annual increases ranging from 2.3 per cent to 4.2 per cent.\n\nThe rises were driven largely by higher housing and food costs \u2014 two of the biggest and least avoidable expenses in household budgets \u2014 as well as recreation and culture.\n\nThe ABS living cost indexes track changes in households' out-of-pocket expenses, offering a clearer picture of how rising costs are felt day to day.\n\nIt comes as a major food charity warns that this week's interest rate rise will push people who are already struggling even further into financial hardship.\n\nWhich households were hit hardest?\n\nThose relying primarily on government payments \u2014 including pensioner and beneficiary households \u2014 recorded the largest rise in living costs over the year, with living costs rising by 4.1 to 4.2 per cent.\n\nThat was driven in part by higher electricity prices as state-based rebates in Queensland and Western Australia were used up.\n\nEmployee households \u2014 where wages and salaries are the main source of income \u2014 recorded the smallest annual rise in living costs, up 2.3 per cent.\n\nThose on government payments \u2014 particularly pensioners \u2014 have seen the greatest cost-of-living increase, according to new data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Source: SBS News\n\nThe ABS said this group benefited most from earlier falls in mortgage interest charges, which make up a larger share of their spending than for other household types.\n\nLast year, the Reserve Bank of Australia cut rates in February, March and August.\n\nThis week, the RBA lifted the cash rate to 3.85 per cent \u2014 its first hike in more than two years \u2014 raising concerns that housing costs could once again climb, particularly for mortgage holders and renters.\n\nWhat's driving higher living costs?\n\nOver the year, housing, food and non-alcoholic beverages, recreation and culture remained the biggest contributors to rising costs.\n\nHousing costs rose sharply, led by a 21.5 per cent jump in electricity prices as state-based rebates were wound back. Rents rose 3.9 per cent, while new dwelling costs increased 3 per cent.\n\nFood prices increased 3.5 per cent, reflecting higher grocery and eating-out costs.\n\nMeat and seafood rose 4.4 per cent, with particularly steep increases for beef and veal (+10.8 per cent) and lamb and goat (+13.4 per cent). Fruit and vegetable prices were up 4 per cent, affected by extreme rainfall in Queensland.\n\nHousing saw the greatest price increase over the last year with a 5.5 per cent rise. Source: SBS News\n\nRecreation and culture costs also climbed, driven by higher travel prices. Holiday travel and accommodation rose 5.8 per cent, with domestic travel up 9.6 per cent and international travel and accommodation jumping 24.4 per cent.\n\nBut compared to the September 2025 quarter, the rise in living costs across all household types slowed.\n\n\"This quarter, lower electricity and health costs offset rises in other areas of living costs,\" ABS head of prices statistics Michelle Marquardt said.\n\nShe noted Commonwealth Energy Bill Relief Fund payments and falling medical costs helped reduce out-of-pocket expenses for some households during the quarter.\n\nInterest rate rises to 'squeeze' households further, warns charity\n\nStill, some warn that cost of living pressures are already pushing households into crisis \u2014 and that this week's interest rate rise could make things worse.\n\nFood relief charity OzHarvest says it is struggling to keep up with demand amid growing food insecurity.\n\n\"This is a national emergency hiding in plain sight,\" OzHarvest founder Ronni Kahn AO told SBS News.\n\n\"Charities are stretched beyond their limits, as the gap between demand and resources keeps widening.\"\n\nKahn said it was the toughest conditions the organisation had seen and expected pressures to intensify following the Reserve Bank's latest rate hike.\n\n\"Rising rents, repeated moves, and unstable living situations are already putting enormous pressure on families,\" she said. \"This week's interest rate rise will only squeeze household budgets further.\"\n\n\"Many are already facing impossible choices between paying rent and putting food on the table. With costs continuing to climb, even the basics \u2014 like a meal for your children \u2014 can become a daily struggle.\"\n\nThe Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) said people on the lowest incomes were bearing the brunt of rising costs, with many forced to go without essentials.\n\n\"The cost of living crisis shows no sign of easing for people on the lowest incomes,\" ACOSS CEO Cassandra Goldie told SBS News.\n\n\"Our surveys show that people receiving income support are being forced to skip meals, go without critical medication or sleep in their cars because payments are woefully inadequate.\"\n\nGoldie said the high cost of everyday items was driving widespread deprivation, particularly among single parents and First Nations people.\n\n\"People receiving JobSeeker are 14 times more likely to lack a substantial meal at least once a day,\" she said, adding they were also significantly more likely to lack access to necessities such as a mobile phone, internet or a washing machine.\n\n\"JobSeeker is just 42 per cent of the minimum wage. We know minimum wage workers are doing it tough, but people who lose their job must try and survive on an income less than half of that.\"\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is battling for his political future, as the fallout grows in the wake of last week's Epstein files release.\n\nThe latest crisis to hit Starmer's government follows scrutiny over his appointment of Peter Mandelson as US ambassador in 2024, when Mr Mandelson's ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were already known.\n\nMr Starmer has apologised to Epstein's victims in a public address over the matter.\n\n\"I am sorry. Sorry for what was done to you. Sorry that so many people with power failed you. Sorry for having believed Mandelson's lies and appointed him. And sorry that even now, you're forced to watch this story unfold in public once again.\"\n\nMr Starmer confirmed on Thursday he was aware that ties between Mr Mandelson and Epstein had endured despite Epstein's 2008 conviction in the US for soliciting a minor.\n\nBut he claims Mr Mandelson repeatedly lied about the depth of his relationship with the disgraced financier, both before and after he was appointed as ambassador.\n\n\"Mandelson was asked directly about the nature of his relationship with Epstein. He was asked whether he had stayed at Epstein after his conviction. And when, later, further information came to light, he was asked whether he had accepted gifts and hospitality, about whether he had been fully transparent about the relationship. The information now available makes clear that the answers he gave were lies.\"\n\nFollowing an earlier release of files relating to Epstein in September last year, Mr Starmer fired the former UK minister after he had served only seven months as ambassador.\n\nThe September release revealed Mr Mandelson had remained close to Epstein for much longer than he had previously acknowledged.\n\nThe ex-envoy is one of numerous prominent figures in the spotlight again this week, after the latest release of documents by the US Justice Department.\n\nThe files included emails appearing to show just how close the relationship between the former ambassador and Epstein was, and also suggested Mr Mandelson had shared government documents with Epstein while serving as a Cabinet Minister.\n\nDuring a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Starmer attempted to distance himself from Mr Mandelson, calling the alleged leaks to Epstein 'disgraceful'.\n\n\"To learn that there was a Cabinet Minister leaking sensitive information at the height of the response to the 2008 crash is beyond infuriating, and I am as angry as the public and any member of this House. Mandelson betrayed our country, our Parliament and my party.\"\n\nThe latest release has raised doubts about Mr Starmer's judgement and left some questioning if he can remain prime minister.\n\nOpposition leader Kemi Badenoch [[bade-knock]]on Thursday described Starmer's position as \"clearly untenable\".\n\nShe urged Labour MPs to support calls to hold a no-confidence vote in Mr Starmer in parliament \u2014 where Labour has a comfortable majority.\n\n\"It is now up to Labour MPs to do the right thing. I know there are many of them who are horrified by what has happened. We saw that in the House of Commons just yesterday. They might now expect the Prime Minister to take responsibility, but we know he won't. He will have to be dragged out of Number 10.\"\n\nFacing questions about whether he could remain in power, Mr Starmer said he intended to continue doing what he described as his \"vital work\" as prime minister.\n\nLocal media are speculating this latest release could see the end of Mr Starmer's leadership, while Londoners have expressed mixed views over his political future.\n\n\"I feel that Starmer probably made the best choice at the time, but obviously information has come out since then and the rest will be up to the politicians around him, I suspect.\"\n\n\"As a whole, Labour has sort of lost a lot of trust, especially with all of the little problems which keep adding up and then scandal upon scandal, like with the Rachel Reeves thing as well, it's sort of, yeah, adding up to the point where I do feel, I don't know how soon, but maybe he'll have to go.\"\n\nMr Mandelson has not publicly commented on the latest release, but the saga has prompted his resignation from parliament's House of Lords earlier this week.\n\nFor decades he's been a divisive figure in British politics, having twice resigned from government for alleged misconduct.\n\nAfter the latest revelations, the 72 year old is now the subject of a police investigation into claims of misconduct in a public office which \u2014 if charged and convicted \u2014 could lead to a prison term.",

On one side of the tracks, in East Melbourne, the grass is green and neatly managed by the City of Melbourne, one of Victoria's wealthiest councils.\n\nOn the other side, in Fitzroy, the median strip is dry, overgrown and unmowed.\n\nThat strip has become the centre of a growing dispute between local and state government over who is responsible for maintaining the road \u2014 and a fresh flashpoint in broader criticism of the Victorian Labor government, led by Premier Jacinta Allan.\n\nDivided road, divided responsibilities\n\nWhile Victoria Parade and its median strip are state-managed assets, the City of Yarra \u2014 which the road runs through \u2014 has refused to continue footing the bill for maintenance, arguing the responsibility sits squarely with the state government.\n\nCity of Yarra mayor Stephen Jolly has likened the stalemate to a geopolitical stand-off.\n\n\"Either we give in and spend hundreds of thousands of dollars of ratepayers' money doing Jacinta Allan's job or we keep pressuring them to actually do their job,\" Jolly told radio station 3AW recently.\n\nThe City of Yarra has refused to mow a median strip on a major Melbourne arterial road, saying it's \"being bled\" by the state government not maintaining assets it is responsible for. Source: SBS News / Zacharias Szumer\n\nAs a form of protest, the City of Yarra stopped mowing the Victoria Parade median strip, saying it has not received additional funding to cover the work.\n\n\"It is embarrassing. It's like North and South Korea kind of thing. That's where we are at the moment.\"\n\nJolly has argued the dispute is part of a broader pattern of \"cost shifting\" from the state government, which he says is costing local councils close to $24 million.\n\nOpposition seizes on grass dispute\n\nVictorian Opposition leader Jess Wilson has seized on the dispute, releasing a social media video on the weekend showing Opposition MPs mowing part of the median strip.\n\n\"This is the grass the Labor Government can't afford to mow,\" Wilson says in the video. \"It seems Jacinta Allan can't do her job, so we're here to do it for her.\"\n\nThe video shows several members of the Opposition wearing high-visibility vests and protective eyewear, claiming the job took \"only thirty minutes\".\n\nWhen SBS News visited Victoria Parade on Monday, it appeared a small section of the median strip had been mowed.\n\nAsked about the issue at a press conference on Monday, Transport and Infrastructure Minister Gabrielle Williams said the Opposition's weekend grass cutting was a \"stunt\".\n\n\"I think it\u2019s fair to say the Liberal party is embracing stunts as they head into an election year,\" Williams said. \"It is a slight sidestep from their usual practice of fighting with each other either through the courts or through the media.\"\n\nSBS News has contacted Premier Jacinta Allan's office for comment.\n\nCost-shifting a 'major concern'\n\nCost-shifting refers to situations where one level of government transfers responsibility for services or infrastructure to another \u2014 often without providing enough funding to cover the cost.\n\nA spokesperson for the Australian Local Government Association (ALGA) said it was an issue of \"major concern for councils\".\n\n\"Every new Commonwealth policy or strategy has cost implications for other levels of government \u2014 most of which local governments aren\u2019t compensated for,\" ALGA told SBS News.\n\nIt says the practice is challenging the long-term financial sustainability of councils in Australia.\n\n\"Cost-shifting is having a real effect on communities across Australia. Every service shifted to local government without compensation reduces the services the council can provide.\"\n\nLocal Government NSW's latest cost-shifting report revealed a total cost shift to councils of $1.36 billion in 2021-22, equivalent to more than $460 per ratepayer annually.\n\nIn Queensland, that figure amounted to $360 million in 2021-22 \u2014 a 378 per cent increase from $47 million in 2002.\n\n\"The impact of this cost-shifting isn\u2019t academic. Cuts to councils are cuts to community liveability,\" the ALGA said.\n\n\"Every service shifted to local government means that people miss out because funding, policies and legislation from federal and state governments haven't kept pace with the needs of every local community.\"\n\n'Being bled', says local council\n\nThe City of Yarra has pointed to other major arterial roads within its boundaries \u2014 including Bridge Rd, Alexandra Pde, Burnley St and Hoddle St \u2014 which it says also require maintenance from the state government.\n\nThat last one was mowed last week \"at last\" by the state government, Jolly said.\n\nJolly has also said the council has been forced to pick up responsibility for services such as school crossing supervision and needle collection near a safe injecting room \u2014 tasks he argues should be funded by the state.\n\n\"We're being bled,\" he said.\n\nIn late 2023, the City of Yarra stopped monthly maintenance on state-managed roads after receiving $88,000 from the state government for work it says costs more than $1 million a year, according to The Age newspaper.\n\nThe City of Melbourne maintains its side of the median strip under an agreement with VicRoads and the Department of Transport and Planning.\n\nA spokesperson for the City of Yarra told SBS News that the City of Melbourne has a revenue and budget surplus \"three times the size of ours\".\n\nAcross Victoria, responsibility for road maintenance is split between different levels of government. The Department of Transport and Planning manages about 11 per cent of the road network, largely freeways and major arterial roads, while the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action and Parks Victoria are responsible for a further 28 per cent, mostly roads through parks and forests.\n\nLocal councils manage around 60 per cent, primarily local roads.\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter.",

Got it Share A A A\n\nLawyers are reporting a surge in requests for advice about separation and divorce after the summer holidays, as couples emerge from extended periods together resolving to part ways. Jodylee Bartal, an accredited specialist in family law and a principal solicitor at Melbourne firm KHQ Lawyers, said she typically observed a \u201cspike\u201d in requests for advice about divorce in December, \u201cjust before Christmas, and in January\u201d. Requests for advice about separation and divorce increase after summer, lawyers say. Monique Westermann This year, the trend ramped up. Bartal said new client enquiries in family law matters in January more than tripled the December figure. One new client had received a \u201crather unexpected letter from her ex\u2019s lawyer on December 24 and needed urgent advice about property, parenting and child support matters\u201d, she said.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother client had agreed with his wife that their marriage was at an end and to separate under the same roof but to \u201cdelay telling the kids\u201d. \u201cIt \u2018blew up\u2019 over the holidays,\u201d Bartal said. Related Article Sex & relationships More baggage, fewer expectations: How Gen X is redefining love in midlife \u201cPeople get to the end of the calendar year and think about what they want to bring into the new year. \u201cFinancial pressures are often a trigger for conflict. There is also the stress of managing the care of kids over the almost seven-week break and work commitments.\u201d Bartal said that \u201cfor the more complex financial matters, such as where there are businesses involved, December and January makes sense from a financial reporting point of view\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFourth-quarter financials are in, [and] six months of data gives a pretty good indication of the likely end of financial year results. \u201cThe parties think, sometimes optimistically, they have six months to negotiate an in-principle agreement and \u2018close out\u2019 their financial relationship by the end of financial year.\u201d She said couples or individuals thinking about separating from their partner needed to consider issues such as strategies for separating safely, whether they \u201cshould move out or is it better to stay in the house\u201d, and interim financial and parenting arrangements. Under Australian family law, couples must have been separated for at least 12 months before they can apply for a divorce. It is possible to be separated while living under the same roof, but there may be safety and other considerations. Court filings\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe increase in requests for advice about divorce in the New Year is not reflected in court filings in January due to the lag between starting the separation process and filing an application for divorce in the Federal Circuit and Family Court. Court registries and law firms also shut down in late December to early January. A monthly breakdown of divorce applications filed between 2021 and January, supplied by the Federal Circuit and Family Court, reveals applications for divorce have been relatively steady in January over the past six years. This year, 3381 applications were filed, compared with 3449 last year. The 2021-25 figures show divorce applications increased each February compared with the previous month. Last year, applications peaked in July and August, at 4345 and 4272 respectively, and decreased towards the end of the year, ending with 3265 in December.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Divorce season\u2019 Hayder Shkara, principal of Justice Family Lawyers, said: \u201cWhat makes January different is not that relationships suddenly fail, but that people finally feel able, emotionally and practically, to act on decisions they\u2019ve been sitting with for some time. \u201cWhile there isn\u2019t a single official dataset that labels January as \u2018divorce season,\u2019 there is a well-recognised and consistent trend across the family law sector that enquiries ... spike in the first quarter of the year, particularly in January and February.\u201d Hayder said that \u201cin the last week of January, our office was contacted by a parent who had stayed in an unhappy relationship through Christmas so their children could enjoy the holidays\u201d. \u201cWithin days of school returning, they moved out of the family home and urgently sought advice because there were no agreed arrangements in place for the children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cJanuary was the point where living in limbo became unworkable and the need for formal advice became immediate.\u201d Michael Tiyce, principal of Sydney law firm Tiyce & Lawyers, said his firm often saw \u201cpeaks in enquiry after long periods of time that people have spent together\u201d, such as after school holidays and when COVID lockdowns were lifted. Tiyce said \u201cunderlying tensions and issues come to a head when people are spending more time together\u201d. \u201cOften people are consuming more alcohol, and sometimes other substances, which can lead to frayed tempers,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other cases, people simply come to the realisation that they have had enough and that it is time to bring the relationship to a close.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Sunday Life Do you need a midlife coach? The professionals helping to answer life\u2019s big questions Tiyce said that \u201cwhile we always provide people with details for therapy or counselling, which some take up and others choose not to, following these sorts of periods we make a point of ensuring that people are clear that they are making a final decision\u201d. \u201cIt should not be a decision made simply out of exhaustion caused by changed routines or environments. \u201cThis is particularly important given the significant impact such a decision will have on their own lives, as well as on the lives of their spouse or partner and any children involved.\u201d An application for divorce must be filed in court. Other issues between the parties such as parenting arrangements and property division can be settled outside court.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf couples do decide to separate,\u201d Tiyce said, \u201cthey should expect to receive very clear advice from their family lawyer that the matter should be negotiated and, where possible, resolved through negotiation or mediation. \u201cIt is now very unusual for parties to simply proceed directly to the Family Court. There are rules governing why that cannot or should not occur, but as a matter of practicality, the cost \u2013 both financial and emotional \u2013 and the level of stress and conflict involved in litigation are so great that people should do everything they reasonably can to avoid it.\u201d",

Got it Share A A A\n\nThe first time I read the words \u201cOzempic face\u201d I clicked, genuinely alarmed by the implication that this class of drug might be disfiguring its users. I was relieved to find nothing pointing to actual harm, especially given how many people in my immediate circle had started taking it. But the relief was short-lived. \u201cOzempic neck\u201d is not a medical issue. Getty Images As the months rolled on, my feeds filled with articles, TikToks and Instagram posts with disparaging descriptions of facial changes resulting from the use of GLP-1s; a class of drug originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, now also prescribed for weight management. Words like \u201csagging\u201d, \u201chollow\u201d, and \u201cdeflated\u201d suddenly dominated the discourse around the drugs. And the \u201cconcerns\u201d seemed to be migrating south, as \u201cOzempic neck\u201d entered the chat, along with mention of \u201cOzempic arms\u201d and \u201cOzempic butt\u201d popping up in mainstream reporting. Conversations about aesthetic changes linked to GLP-1 medications have been growing online since the term \u201cOzempic face\u201d entered the lexicon around early 2023, finding a comfortable home in a TikTok ecosystem where Ozempic-related content has amassed hundreds of millions of views. Unsurprisingly, much of the chatter comes from the pages of cosmetic surgeons offering expensive and invasive procedures as a \u201cfix\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what doesn\u2019t seem to be catching on is the fact that these changes are not, strictly speaking, a medical side effect, or a formal diagnosis. They\u2019re a purely aesthetic observation \u2013 one that is by no means unique to taking GLP-1 medication. Related Article Medicine \u2018Not for human consumption\u2019: Warning to Australians injecting bootlegged weight-loss drug Phrases like \u201cOzempic neck\u201d, or \u201cOzempic face\u201d might imply an air of medical legitimacy, but they\u2019re media buzzwords working to draw conversation away from anything medical and back to the real heart of the issue \u2013 physical attractiveness. These biting critiques really give away the game for those who purport to be concerned only about the health of those taking the drugs for weight loss. I would suggest that gawking at those whose bodies are changing rapidly on the drugs does nothing to improve their health. And absurd as this nomadic \u201cconcern\u201d might be, it shows the speed at which we\u2019re careening ever closer to a world where a person\u2019s appearance is all that matters. Singling out Ozempic also implies the drug is uniquely \u201cdisfiguring\u201d, which is inaccurate. Looser skin, facial volume loss, and changes to the neck can happen with any significant or rapid weight loss, and in some cases, the natural ageing process. But that doesn\u2019t matter when the point is to frame bodily changes as failures, and to reinforce the idea that people in bigger bodies MUST lose weight, but not too fast! And certainly not in a way that shows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, this is nothing new. It\u2019s something people living in marginalised bodies have been dealing with forever, repackaged for the algorithm age: concern-trolling dressed up as clinical concern. And given these online spaces thrive on a combination of impossible beauty standards and body scrutiny (at least 500,000 Aussies are taking GLP-1s and climbing), we will no doubt have a new body part to nitpick within the month. Related Article Weight loss Game changing weight-loss drugs need to be taken for life, or health benefits are lost To be clear, this is not some new brand of stigma now targeting thin bodies. It\u2019s an extension of the stigma that people in bigger bodies face in almost every corner of our culture. What we\u2019re seeing now is a kind of unapologetic admission that we really, truly don\u2019t give a rat\u2019s furry behind about the health of people in larger bodies; we care about the way they look. Indeed, if your body is deemed \u201cunhealthy\u201d due to its size, we offer a barrage of stigma and shame with a few \u201chelpful\u201d weight loss suggestions thrown in. If you lose weight quickly with medication or otherwise, we go about scrutinising your face, neck, arms and butt for \u201cdamage\u201d. And perhaps most galling (and least surprising) is the pace at which clinics and specialists are jumping to offer fixes ... for a price. You might call it concern. You might call it a side effect. But in the end, it\u2019s the same worn out permission slip to condemn fat bodies, with a checkout link attached.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChanging bodies remain season for public scrutiny, and when drastic weight changes are involved, cruelty becomes acceptable, even marketable. Let\u2019s be honest. That\u2019s not \u201cconcern for health\u201d, is it? It\u2019s punishment for losing weight the \u201cwrong\u201d way.

The charred trees are a reminder that the Carlisle River fires, although not currently a threat, are still burning in the Otways and could pose a danger to nearby communities if conditions take a turn for the worse. But Rogerson\u2019s worries about safety extend far beyond the flames. Janet Rogerson on her farm just outside of Simpson in western Victoria. Nicole Cleary During electricity outages, Rogerson routinely loses mobile coverage, as do many other residents in the small town of Simpson and its surrounds. It is a problem plaguing regional and rural communities across Victoria.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the catastrophic fire danger day on January 9, Rogerson, who is a Telstra customer, said she lost mobile service. She was unable to make calls or access data to check the Vic Emergency app. \u201cMy elderly dad was trying to ring me to find out what was happening with the fires,\u201d she said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t get through to me.\u201d Rogerson said she lost Telstra network coverage a second time later in the month. Mobile towers in the town of Simpson. Nicole Cleary \u201cThey\u2019re happy to take our premium payments but not so happy to help us out when we need them in an emergency, which is very disappointing,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFellow Simpson resident and community centre co-ordinator Debra Smith became so fed up with the regular mobile network outages that she eventually took it to the top and emailed Telstra\u2019s chief executive, Vicki Brady. \u201cAnd I still got nowhere,\u201d Smith said. Simpson is served by Telstra and Optus towers. During Telstra outages, customers can supposedly access coverage on the Optus tower. But that only allows SOS calls, not data. Debra Smith is raising the alarm about mobile network failures. Nicole Cleary When the Telstra network fails and customers are not within range of an Optus tower, Smith says they lose mobile connection altogether. It means they cannot call Triple Zero or notify authorities in the case of a car accident or other emergencies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt could be life-threatening,\u201d Smith said. Smith noticed the problem was getting worse in 2019 and has made numerous attempts to work with Telstra to rectify the issue. \u201cThe bulk of people in this area are with Telstra because it does have superior coverage out here,\u201d she said. RMIT electronics and telecommunications engineering associate professor Mark Gregory agrees the regular mobile coverage failures are a serious and worsening problem. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more events like fires, floods and heat, and we\u2019ve got more outages occurring,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGregory said other links in the telecommunications chain were also problematic, including telephone exchanges. He argued that regulations governing when telecommunications companies must keep customers and the public notified about major and significant local outages were too weak. The Australian Communications and Media Authority defines a major outage as one that affects or is likely to affect 100,000 or more services or all carriage services using the network in a state or territory and is expected to last at least 60 minutes. It defines a significant local outage as one that affects 250 or more services in remote Australia and is expected to last at least three hours. A significant local outage is also one affecting at least 1000 services in regional Australia and is expected to last six or more hours. Gregory said telecommunications companies should have to report all outages so they were held accountable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAll outages are important,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s big or small \u2013 people can\u2019t call Triple Zero.\u201d The Carlisle River fire has caused extensive damage and is still burning. Justin McManus In the north Victorian town of Euroa, power outages resulting in mobile phone coverage losses are an ongoing problem. Euroa Chamber of Business and Commerce president Stephanie Swift said regular mobile outages were dangerous and disrupted the town\u2019s ability to trade, particularly for retailers. \u201cIt\u2019s getting pretty dire here,\u201d she said. A Telstra spokesperson said the company understood the importance of telecommunications during the recent bushfires that had affected Simpson and Euroa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen fires like this occur, power outages and extreme heat are the main causes of network interruptions, with some infrastructure also being damaged due to the conditions,\u201d the spokesperson said. Firefighters putting out spot fires on the Colac-Lavers Hill road. Nearby residents are concerned the fire danger is still not over. Justin McManus They said Telstra had back-up power systems at most sites and some key locations had fixed generators. The company said that in the recent fires, restoration efforts were hampered by blocked roads and safety exclusion zones that impeded access to damaged infrastructure. The federal government has introduced legislation to establish the Universal Outdoor Mobile Obligation, which will require network operators to provide outdoor mobile voice and text coverage nationwide.

Got it Share A A A\n\nTangaroa Hau-Hadfield has a simple rule for his three kids: when they\u2019re in the car, they can only speak Te Reo Maori. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a five-minute trip, a 20-minute trip, a two-hour trip, sometimes it makes the trip nice and quiet,\u201d he says, laughing. It\u2019s just one way he\u2019s working to keep the language and te ao Maori (Maori culture) alive in his Brisbane household. Brisbane-based father-of-three Tangaroa Hau-Hadfield has one rule in the car: the kids can only speak Te Reo Maori. Brittney Deguara \u201c[We\u2019re] grateful to be able to practise our culture here in another country because it\u2019s a lost culture, a lost language, and so it\u2019s our responsibility to get that back for us and for our kids.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLike many of the almost 10,000 Kiwis who moved to Queensland in the last financial year, Hau-Hadfield came across the Tasman Sea in search of a better lifestyle. He left Hokianga in Aotearoa/New Zealand\u2019s far north over a decade ago to work in Australia\u2019s mining industry. He then met his wife, and they welcomed three tamariki (children). However, it took him five years to find his Brisbane whanau (family). That emerged as the competitive kapa haka group Te Kapa Haka o Te Kahu Ariki, based in Eagleby. \u201cWe always say we\u2019re more than a kapa haka group, it\u2019s more so a family \u2013 we know what makes each other tick, what makes each other happy,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis time last year, my partner and I were talking about moving back to New Zealand, and the only real thing that kept us here was our kapa haka group. That\u2019s the commitment and the ties that we have to these people, and I\u2019m happy that we chose to stay.\u201d The group formed in Brisbane three years ago to \u201ckeep our culture alive\u201d, said leader Andre Ahipene. Te Kahu Ariki are busy preparing for the upcoming 10th Australian Maori Kapa Haka Festival. Te Kahu Ariki \u201cWhen one practises who they truly are through tradition and through culture, you become closer to the land in which you live on,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifestyle. \u201cWe\u2019re very fortunate and privileged that our mana whenua \u2013 the people of this land, our Indigenous peoples \u2013 really support our consistency and being able to practise who we are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCo-leader Gaylene Ahipene added: \u201cTo have someone [who] understands you, to speak the same language, to think the same thoughts \u2026 it helps us really stay connected, not only to ourselves but to one another, and in this world that we live in, it helps us be very grounded.\u201d The couple moved to Brisbane almost two decades ago to \u201chave a break\u201d from their world. But just days after they arrived, they found themselves doing haka. Gaylene and Andre Ahipene are the head tutors and founders of Te Kahu Ariki, a Brisbane-based kapa haka group. Te Kahu Ariki \u201cIt was inevitable that haka was never going to let us get away from who we truly are. This is truly ... a lifestyle. We would not be as healthy, as well, and as vibrant as we are \u2013 fit and able \u2013 if we didn\u2019t have haka in our life. I think we would seize up,\u201d Andre said. \u201cHaka has been our oranga, our fountain of youth, and the spring in our step in life.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe group is in the thick of rehearsals for the upcoming 10th Australian Maori Kapa Haka Festival, taking place on the Gold Coast at the end of March. They will be one of nine groups vying for the chance to compete in the largest traditional Maori performing arts celebration in the world, Te Matatini 2027 in Waikato. Te Kahu Ariki are one of nine Australian kapa haka groups competing in this year\u2019s event on the Gold Coast. Te Kahu Ariki \u201cThat would be life-changing, especially for our members as well, they\u2019ve worked so hard here, but to actually go home and stand on your own whenua [land], to perform with your own people, it just takes it that whole other step higher,\u201d Gaylene said during a Sunday rehearsal. \u201cThat would be our kapa, our members, our ropu [group] retracing their ancestral steps home,\u201d Andre added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLarge-scale opportunities like this for Maori living in Brisbane to connect are rare. Andre hopes developmental conferences and language retreats will become more frequent, as many Maori come to Queensland for better employment opportunities and to \u201cget ahead in life\u201d. \u201cWhat I believe would mobilise us extremely would be opportunities to come together and unite, so our people can consistently find us,\u201d he said. But for Hau-Hadfield and the Ahipenes, the continuation of te ao Maori in Brisbane is for their children. \u201cThey just come in the space and they\u2019re sponges, they pick things up just as fast as we do \u2013 or probably even faster,\u201d Hau-Hadfield explained. \u201c[We\u2019ve] had our four children here, it\u2019s evolution \u2013 we\u2019re evolving with the time, and we\u2019re just bringing our babies along,\u201d Gaylene said.

The French organisers had not one, but two, internationally renowned divas on hand to make the most of one of the world\u2019s most photogenic cities.\n\nViewers had almost no time to recover from Lady Gaga\u2019s cabaret performance on the banks of the Seine before C\u00e9line Dion was hoisted up on the Eiffel Tower for an emotional rendition of \u00c9dith Piaf\u2019s Hymne \u00e0 l\u2019amour. Adding to the drama was the songstress\u2019 surprise live performance being her first after sharing her stiff-person syndrome diagnosis two years prior.\n\nBut if anyone was going to match that level of flair, it was the Italians. The fact Milano Cortina 2026 is the most spread-out Winter Olympics in history \u2013 competition venues dot an area of more than 22,000 square kilometres \u2013 was no handicap to organisers, who turned lemons into Limoncello by treating the four-site opening ceremony as an opportunity to make it compelling for those watching at home.\n\nThere were hints ahead of time that they would deliver. After all, only someone with their finger on the pulse would understand the best way to court the Gen Z audience \u2013 who presents a challenge for the International Olympic Committee in how they consume sporting content less than half as much as entertainment content \u2013 is to tap fictional gay Canadian ice hockey players to be torchbearers (Heated Rivalry hive, rise).",
