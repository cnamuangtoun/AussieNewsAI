        "text": "Through bumper crops, droughts, and average years in between, a group of 100,000 Australian grain farmers have formed an online community through a Facebook group which aims to share the highs and lows of farming across the country.\n\nThe Harvesting the Crop group was started by South Australian farmer John Gladigau in 2013 as a place for farmers to compare crop notes and share photos, jokes and advice.\n\nJohn Gladigau farmed in SA's Mallee region for many years and is now Grain Producers SA chair. (ABC News: Ben Deacon)\n\nHe said it was the only group he could find dedicated to Australian grain farming on Facebook at the time and it quickly gained a local and global following.\n\nIt has just cracked 100,000 followers with about 20,000 people following from overseas.\n\nDavid Klimpsch placed second in the \"best looking farm dog\" category with this cute crop lurker. (Supplied: David Klimpsch)\n\n\"I think people value it very highly,\" Mr Gladigau said.\n\n\"It's like going to a really good field day or meeting people down at the pub and just sitting around and talking about things, but in a really comfortable environment.\n\n\"I think there's a real source of pride within the group and I think the reason [it's] been so successful is because of the people who are part of the group.\"\n\nThis impressive image of a very stuck header captured first place in \"bogged and busted\". (Supplied: Emma Craft)\n\nLending a hand\n\nLouise Smith runs a mixed farming operation at Maggea in South Australia's Mallee region, an area severely impacted by drought in recent years, and has been following the group for several years.\n\nLouise Smith says the Harvesting the Crop Facebook group has become a great online community for farmers. (ABC Riverland: Amelia Walters)\n\nShe said it had become a source of support for her and her family when they ran into trouble with their farm machinery.\n\n\"We had a breakdown and two days earlier we had seen a post of someone looking for a part for their header and someone piped up and said, 'I have an old header I'm wrecking,'\" she said.\n\n\"The parts on that header actually matched ours. It's a very good page to be following for the little bits you do pick up.\"\n\nLouise Smith's photo of her wheat crop struggling to grow through sand blown onto her property. (Supplied: Louise Smith)\n\nShe shared a startling photo to the group of several heads of wheat buried in sand that had blown onto her property this year as a way to show something \"a bit different\" and the reality of farming in drought.\n\n\"We don't have you-beaut' new headers, new machinery, we're not reaping by any stretch of the imagination a decent crop. But we do have sand,\" she said.\n\nThe \"green and gold\" category went to Libby Meill for this glorious sunset photo. (Supplied: Libby Meill)\n\nLife on the farm\n\nMr Gladigau said he never imagined the group would grow to the size it was and become a place for farmers, who are often isolated in their day to day operations, to find a sense of connection.\n\nThis impressive break time set-up won Kathy Maslin first place in the \"smoko legend\" category. (Supplied: Kathy Maslin)\n\nAfter clocking 100,000 followers he decided to run a photo competition to keep spirits high heading into the current harvest.\n\nThe categories reflected what really goes on day to day on a farm including \"bogged and busted\", \"best looking farm dog\", \"she'll be right\" (bush mechanics), \"fields of green and gold\", \"machinery selfie\" and \"lunch box legend\".\n\nThere were more than 700 entries and about 8,500 people voted on the finalists.\n\nTye Griffiths' emergency pulley replacement earned him first place in the \"she'll be right mate\" category. (Supplied: Tye Griffiths)\n\nEbony Doering farms at Dutton in SA's mid-north region and won the best machinery selfie category of the photo competition.\n\nShe found the group to have a great sense of community and place to share the contribution of farmers to the world.\n\n\"Farmers put in a lot of effort in what they do and a lot of it goes unseen,\" she said.\n\n\"We're producing food for the world and this was one way to show the world what we as farmers do and make that connection.\"\n\nChrstine Schilling posted this entry to the competition of a helicopter flying low over a canola field. (Supplied: Christine Schilling)\n\nMr Gladigau said while he may have started the page he feels it has grown beyond its humble beginnings and has been embraced by Australia's farming community.\n\n\"In some ways I have lost control of it,\" he said.\n\n\"It's now owned by the cropping farmers of Australia as their site, as their group, where they come together to be the Aussie cropping family which I think is fantastic.\"",

Here's everything you need to know about the clash in Adelaide.\n\nThat means Josh Inglis will remain in the side at number seven, while Khawaja is not included after missing the Brisbane Test through back spasms.\n\nAustralia can secure a series win at Adelaide Oval this week, and will celebrate the quickest retention of the urn in more than a century if it wins inside four days.\n\nBut for Khawaja, there are now serious question marks over his future.\n\nThe 38-year-old has enjoyed one of the great late-career resurgences since his recall to the Test team at the start of 2022, starring at the top of the order.\n\nHe averaged 58.7 in his first two years back in the side, but has now passed 50 just twice in his past 27 Test innings.\n\nKhawaja batted in Australia's optional net session on Tuesday, but did not face a new ball in a possible sign that any potential return may be more likely in the middle order.\n\nIt came after Australia's coach Andrew McDonald insisted that it would be premature to write Khawaja off, regardless of whether he played in this Test.\n\nCan't get enough cricket from Grandstand? Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.\n\n\"He's had one back injury in his whole career, so I think that's an overreaction to correlate that to the age of the athlete,\" McDonald told SEN on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"His [Sheffield] Shield numbers are incredibly good comparative to everyone else. I think he has the leading Shield average for the past three or four years.\n\n\"Every time he drops back to that level he dominates. Now if that's a determiner of who is the next best or who is next in line, then he is at the top of the pecking order.\n\n\"It feels as though people want to hear an end date from him or us. But we're not that team, we're not going to put end dates on people.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Steve Smith was the first in the nets to bat on Tuesday, after missing Monday's session due to illness.\n\nSmith, who captained Australia in the first two Test victories due to Cummins's absence, is not considered in any doubt to play.\n\nAustralia XI for the third Ashes Test\n\nJake Weatherald, Travis Head, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon Scott Boland.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

        "text": "The consumer watchdog is suing home meal delivery providers HelloFresh and Youfoodz for allegedly misleading consumers, claiming the companies used what's known as a \"subscription trap\".\n\nThe ACCC claims the high profile meal services broke consumer law by telling customers they could easily cancel subscriptions via online accounts when this wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nInstead, consumers who tried to cancel prior to the first delivery cut-off time were still charged and could only cancel if they spoke with a customer service representative.\n\nThe consumer watchdog has launched two proceedings in the Federal Court.\n\n\"We've brought these two cases because we allege that HelloFresh's and Youfoodz's conduct involved a suite of confusing and unclear subscription practices in breach Australia's consumer laws,\" ACCC Commissioner Luke Woodward said.\n\nHelloFresh which owns both brands has been contacted for comment. (ABC Landline)\n\n\"Despite what HelloFresh and Youfoodz represented to new Australian subscribers, tens of thousands of consumers were charged for their first order, even though they cancelled their subscription before the cut-off date.\"\n\nHelloFresh allegedly engaged in this misleading conduct for more than two years until March this year, while Youfoodz did so between October 2022 and November last year.\n\nDo you have a story to share? Email Specialist.Team@abc.net.au\n\nThis impacted 62,000 HelloFresh customers and 39,000 YouFoodz customers who were charged despite cancelling their subscription before the cut-off date, according to the lawsuits.\n\nHelloFresh required customers to hand over payment details before viewing the full menu but it told customers they, \"would not be charged unless they selected meals from the menu\".\n\nHowever, customers were entered into an ongoing subscription, according to the consumer watchdog.\n\n\"In the case of HelloFresh, many consumers had not even selected meals but were unknowingly subscribed and charged regardless,\" Mr Woodward said.\n\nHelloFresh launched in Australia in 2012 and sells popular meal kits which allow a faster preparation time.\n\nIt advertises heavily and its promotional material features high-profile celebrities like Robert Irwin, TV presenter Sophie Monk and comedian Celeste Barber.\n\nBut customers have long vented their frustration at its subscription practices with online reviews full of complaints about how hard it was to unsubscribe without being hit with unwanted charges.\n\nIn New Zealand, HelloFresh was fined $NZ845,000 for misleading consumers.\n\nThe fine was for cold-calling former customers under the guise of getting feedback but was instead about trying to get people to restart orders with discount vouchers, without it being made clear it could lead to a subscription being restarted \u2014 according to New Zealand's Commerce Commission.\n\nHelloFresh which owns both brands has been contacted for comment.\n\nPush against subscription traps The Albanese government is concerned about \"unfair trading practices\" and is looking at introducing legislation to counter it.\n\nConsumer groups have long called for action on \"subscription traps\" where it is easy for customers to start paying a company but very difficult to stop.\n\nThe Albanese government promised in 2023 it would crackdown on subscription traps and other unfair business practices with new consumer laws.\n\nThat push received a major boost in November when states and territories agreed to back its plan to ban \"unfair trading practices\".\n\nAssistant Minister for Competition Andrew Leigh said the government was \"putting an end to sneaky business tricks like subscription traps and hidden fees\".\n\n\"These reforms will stop unfair trading practices that distort consumer choice and drive-up costs, making markets fairer and giving Australians a fair go,\" he said.\n\nThe government said it would draft the new laws and begin consultation next year.",

He had 0-45 from 2.4 overs.\n\nUnder the rules, two full-toss deliveries over waist height from one bowler means the umpires can pull that bowler from the attack for the rest of the match.\n\nAdding to the drama, Seifert was injured while batting \u2014 apparently hurting a side muscle \u2014 and did not keep wickets on Monday night. Mohammad Rizwan took his place behind the stumps at Kardinia Park.\n\nSeifert smashed 102 from 56 balls, making him only the second Renegades player to score a BBL ton, as Melbourne amassed 5-212.\n\nAfter controversy about the Geelong drop-in pitch, it was the highest score at the venue.\n\nOpener Colin Munro and Jimmy Peirson gave the injury-depleted Heat some hope with half-centuries, but they were kept to 8-198 as Melbourne won by 14 runs.\n\nSeifert said he was rested as a precaution.\n\n\"It was a bit of a tight side \u2026 a big tournament ahead, so [we] didn't want to risk anything,\" he said.\n\nPerth won the toss and there was a solemn start to the night as the players and fans observed a moment's silence a day after the Bondi terrorist attack.\n\nSeifert's ton came more than a month after he broke a finger while playing in New Zealand, forcing him out of the T20 series against the West Indies.\n\nHe and Peake, the home-town young gun, put on 121 from 57 deliveries for the fourth wicket.\n\nPeake's 59 from 29 balls made him the second-youngest BBL player after Sam Konstas to score a 50 and it showed again that the 19-year-old is one of Australian cricket's brightest young talents.\n\nSeifert was in blazing form from the start, hitting nine fours and six sixes in his ton.\n\nThe wheels well-and-truly fell off for Brisbane in the 18th over when Afridi's two high full tosses meant he was taken off as acting captain Nathan McSweeney bowled the rest of the over \u2014 a nine-ball affair that conceded 22.\n\nCan't get enough cricket from Grandstand? Tune in for the latest cricket news, interviews and analysis from the ABC team in the Grandstand Cricket Podcast.\n\nOpening bowler Xavier Bartlett was the standout, taking 1-24 from his four overs.\n\nJack Wildermuth took 3-34, then opened and went for a three-ball duck in the first over.\n\nMunro looked like he might have been building up to something big but was caught in the deep by Hassan Khan off Will Sutherland for 55 from 32 balls.\n\nThat left Brisbane 5-106 in the 13th over.\n\nPeirson belted 50 from 22, with four fours and three sixes, before Sutherland had him caught in the deep for the seventh wicket.\n\nSutherland led the Renegades well in the field, taking 3-33 from four overs.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

(ABC News: Emily Bissland)\n\nImpact 'cannot be ignored'\n\nThe council organised an advisory committee to help determine the future of the trees.\n\nGroup member Sarah Hope joined after she created a petition to save the trees.\n\nMs Hope said the trees added \"charm\" to the city, and had a positive impact on local climate, biodiversity and mental health.\n\nSarah Hope led a campaign to save the 40-year-old London plane trees. (ABC News: Emily Bissland)\n\nNow Ms Hope accepts that some of the trees need to go, and the group is \"overwhelmingly\" in favour of their removal.\n\n\"We had our first meeting, and we were presented with arborist reports and engineer reports,\" Ms Hope said.\n\n\" The reports were quite damning for [the trees], unfortunately. \"\n\nSouthern Grampians Shire councillor Afton Barber said the decision to remove the trees was hard, but necessary.\n\n\"The trees have long been an iconic fixture within our streets, but their impact cannot be ignored,\" Cr Barber said.\n\n\"We need streets that are safe for residents and visitors of all abilities so they can feel confident to shop and socialise in Hamilton.\"\n\nSouthern Grampians Shire Council has documented root damage to a building on Gray Street. (Supplied: Southern Grampians Shire Council)\n\nKeeping it green\n\nMs Hope said the advisory group would now focus on how greenery and shade protection could be retained on Gray Street.\n\n\"It became incumbent on me and other members of the group who did want to keep the trees to come up with a solution,\" she said.\n\nMs Hope said she wanted another tree to replace the London planes and for vertical gardens to be installed.\n\nThe advisory group will also investigate whether other London plane trees should be removed from the city.\n\n\"This is going to be the next best scenario for those that love a green centre of Gray Street,\" Ms Hope said.\n\n\"This is a test pilot for the rest of the town.\"\n\nLondon plane flowers release pollen, but the trichomes on their leaves are a more common irritant. (ABC News: Emily Bissland)\n\nThe council said it was working on an updated design, including proposals for replacement tree species, greening walls and alternative footpath treatments for Gray Street.\n\nIt will also develop the updated concept designs for further community engagement next year, and consider the removal of about 75 other London plane trees in the city.\n\n'Better to spend the money and have the trees'\n\nUniversity of Melbourne horticulture expert Greg Moore said the removal of London plane trees was common across metropolitan and regional areas.\n\n\"[Councils] see the problems associated with these trees \u2026 but they forget the benefits,\" Dr Moore said.\n\n\"When those trees are removed, it will make a huge difference to the streetscape in Hamilton, and it will make a significant difference to temperatures in summer.\"\n\nGreg Moore says the council could face similar issues in the future with different tree species. (ABC News: Darryl Torpy)\n\nMr Moore said there should be stronger investment in maintaining the trees.\n\nHe questioned the council's finding that Gray Street was unsuitable due to its narrowness, given the many plane trees that lined the tight streets of London.\n\n\"The issue here is that they simply don't give them the priority that they should be given,\" Mr Moore said.\n\n\"It's much better to spend the money and have the trees than to lose them.\"",

(Supplied)\n\nHe did not expect a repeat of rainfall totals in the same \"ballpark\", however.\n\n'We certainly could see another double digit amount of rainfall falling onto this pretty wet part of this the state,\" he said.\n\nElsewhere, south-east Queensland is expected to be cloudy for most of the day, with a chance of rain also possible in Brisbane.\n\nAre hailstorms getting more frequent in south-east Queensland? The region has been hit by another round of storms which brought large and even giant hailstones. Is this the new normal?\n\nBrisbane is expected to hit a maximum of 29 degrees Celsius, while Noosa Heads and Surfers Paradise are set for 27C and 28C.\n\nRockhampton and Mackay are expected to reach 32C, while Cairns could hit 33C and Townsville 34C.\n\nToowoomba is not expected to get hotter than 26C.\n\nShane Kennedy from the BOM said the south-east corner will enjoy a \"few days off\" from the worst of the heat before temperatures ramp back up.\n\n\"As we move towards the end of the week though, those temperatures are back to average and even pushing above average as we move into the weekend,\" he said.\n\nSevere storm warning lifted\n\nElsewhere on Tuesday, the BOM said there was a potential for severe thunderstorms in the southern and central interior, and a low chance of one or two thunderstorms in the south-east.\n\nMr Hines said there could be storms over a large part of central Queensland in the afternoon, including across the Darling Downs.\n\nIf they were to eventuate, he said they would likely also be slow-moving and could potentially dump heavy rain in isolated areas.\n\n\"Quite a typical storm pattern, where not everyone through those broad regions will even see or hear a thunderstorm,\" he explained.\n\n\" Lots of people will get a dry day and a relatively clear day. \"\n\nA severe storm warning was issued by the BOM about 7:30am Tuesday.\n\nAn earlier severe storm warning issued by the BOM about 7:30am for the Sunshine Coast was lifted at 8:30am.\n\nThe BOM warned the redevelopment of severe thunderstorms remained possible, however.\n\nA southerly change stalled inland of the Sunshine Coast, helping to create slow-moving heavy showers and thunderstorm activity.\n\nWindy conditions are also expected across the south east with strong wind warnings for the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast waters.\n\nResidents are advised to monitor the radar and thunderstorm warnings.",

        "text": "Newly-crowned AFLW number one draft pick Olivia Wolmarans wants to repay Richmond's faith by taking the struggling Tigers to the top.\n\nRichmond, who finished 16th and sacked coach Ryan Ferguson, traded for Gold Coast's top pick to have first crack at the cream of the crop in this year's draft.\n\nAfter flirting with picking either Scarlett Johnson (pick number two, GWS) or Chloe Bown (pick number five, Adelaide), the Tigers opted for Perth-based power forward Wolmarans.\n\n\"I think I have that energy for Tigers to bring them up, and hopefully we can win a flag,\" the confident 18-year-old said.\n\n\"It means a lot to me that they did that (traded up), but just having conversations with them, they already backed me in, I could see they could believe in me already as a player.\n\n\"So I'm now going to give it back to them and show them how much I can improve their team and bring them to the top again.\"\n\nWolmarans, who wants to be a police officer in the future, will move east as soon as possible.\n\nShe relishes the prospect of playing alongside star Tiger Monique Conti and veteran Katie Brennan and is ready to stamp herself on the league.\n\n\"I'm always going to have that cheeky grin of mine, but I'm pretty laid back,\" she said.\n\n\"You're going to see me move across the ball with my speed, and also me taking contested marks, so hopefully I take a hanger.\n\n\"I play my own game. I don't really play like anyone. I look for attributes from players, but I think I play my own game.\"\n\nWolmarans was a heptathlete before turning her attention full-time to football, and has no regrets over her career choice.\n\n\"I've always known since I was little that I wanted to play AFLW,\" she said.\n\n\"Seeing the girls on the TV, I just wanted to be just like them.\n\n\"And here I am standing here, pick one, it's amazing, and it's probably my best achievement yet.\"\n\nGeorja Davies, Alannah Welsh, Ava Usher, Sunny Lappin and Dekota Baron were all picked by the Suns at the AFLW draft. (Getty Images: James Wiltshire)\n\nIt was a banner night for wooden-spooners Gold Coast, who had six academy selections inside the top 15 and eight overall.\n\nThe Suns matched bids for Sunny Lappin (4), Ava Usher (7), Georja Davies (9), Alannah Welsh (12), Mikayla Nurse (13) and Dekota Baron (15) in the first round before snagging Bronte Parker (32) and Rhianna Ingram (44).\n\nThe Swans didn't match GWS's bid for Kiera Yerbury at pick 3 but snapped up Alex Neyland at 6 and grabbed Madeleine Quinn at 18.\n\nIt meant three Sydney prospects also landed in the first round, making for 11 academy products in the northern states.\n\n\"It's awesome. It shows that it's definitely a bigger sport than just Victoria,\" Yerbury said.\n\n\"I'm glad that I can play my part in that. It's a great opportunity for people from other states to make their mark in footy.\"\n\nTop 10 2025 AFLW draft picks\n\n1. Richmond \u2014 Olivia Wolmarans (Subiaco)\n\n2.

        "text": "In the context of the challenge she had set herself in New Zealand, it is not so much about the ability to withstand pain, but looking within to find the strength to go on. \u201cSisu as a word, it literally means when translated insides, the intestines. It is to understand what and who we are,\u201d she says. Key to this is quietening the expectations of the outside world and listening to ourselves. \u201cSisu is unique as a concept in psychology because in Finnish culture sisu is not just a word that denotes tenacity or this inner resilience and great perseverance, but it also has this flavour of moral correctness and integrity,\u201d Lahti says. \u201cYou do something and you do it really well, even when no one is watching.\u201d Despite depictions in popular culture \u2013 there was an action film called Sisu released in 2022 \u2013 Lahti says true sisu is quiet, contemplative and even gentle. The concept has applications for Australians.\n\nLoading Podcaster Susanna Heiskanen \u2013 author of Nordic Lifestyle: Embrace Slow Living, Cultivate Happiness and Know When to Take off Your Shoes \u2013 sees many similarities between Australians and Finns. \u201cWhen I moved [to Australia] in 2008, I was surprised by how similar these two nations really are. After living 10 years in the UK, it was lovely to discover the shared love of nature between Australians and Finns \u2013 nature is truly important to both cultures. \u201cThe relaxed attitude towards life, people being respectful and kind, always interested in the world around them \u2013 these similar traits made me feel at home from the start.\u201d Susanna Heiskanen says she has seen sisu in action in Australia as communities face adversity like natural disasters together. Credit: Brett Hemmings/Getty Images\n\nBut she has also seen the way Australians unknowingly tap into the tradition of sisu, most tellingly when conditions push people to the brink and communities come together to support each other through hard times. \u201cI see a communal spirit here in Australia that mirrors sisu,\u201d Heiskanen says. \u201cLooking at disaster-affected areas, I see sisu in action \u2013 people working together towards a common goal, using their inner strength to get through flood or bushfire-ravaged lives, rebuilding their livelihoods and homes.\u201d It\u2019s a philosophy that Finns continue to draw upon to withstand difficulties, apparently against the odds, she says. \u201cSisu is a collective determination that the nation has in abundance,\u201d she says. \u201cI recently saw a documentary about Finnish preparedness against occupation or war \u2013 the underground tunnels and halls that are used daily for sports, parking and children\u2019s activities, but can house more people than the entire population of Helsinki. That\u2019s resilience in action: planning ahead and making sure you\u2019re prepared no matter what. \u201cSisu is also taught in schools as a concept when discussing history and the meaning of perseverance. We Finns have learned not to give up even when logic says we should. The 1939 Winter War against Russia is a powerful example of this national character.\u201d\n\nLoading Both women talk about the true strength of sisu being not just in the ability to push on, but also to stop. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can ever have too much sisu. It\u2019s your superpower for happiness, and there\u2019s never too much happiness in the world,\u201d Heiskanen says. \u201cThat said, true sisu also means knowing when to rest and regroup \u2013 it\u2019s sustained strength, not reckless stubbornness.\u201d For Lahti, when pounding the NZ asphalt, the ultimate reckoning came when she listened to what her body was telling her. \u201cIt was a Guiness World Record pursuit and people were watching it, so it was a pressure. But there is always a thing of \u2018are we listening to the drumbeat outside or is it our own?\u2019 That\u2019s where the whole thing shifted for me and that\u2019s where our sisu becomes sustainable, when we listen to ourselves.\u201d",

        "text": "Aldi has once again come out on top as the supermarket with the cheapest groceries, according to a new comparison of a basket of products.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumer group Choice found a basket of 20 items cost $72.41 at Aldi, $98.98 at Woolworths, $100.04 at Coles and $109.25 at IGA, excluding specials.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis represented \"quite a significant gap\" between Aldi and the second-cheapest store, Woolworths, Choice editorial director Mark Serrels said.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quarterly government-backed supermarket survey focused its latest report on entertaining essentials ahead of Christmas in addition to grocery staples.\n\n\n\nThe basket contained items like milk, Weetbix, dried apples, carrots, bananas, chicken breast fillets, cherry tomatoes, bagged mixed salad, salted peanuts, plus other products for a festive gathering such as mineral water, crackers, camembert, stuffed olives and more.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing seven items of basics, including apples, bananas, strawberries, carrots, Weetbix, milk, and chicken breast fillets, and excluding specials, Aldi remained the cheapest at $31.41, followed by Woolworths at $32.20, Coles at $33.16, and IGA at $39.20.\n\n\n\nAldi has once again been found to contain the cheapest groceries in Australia, according to the latest supermarket survey by Choice. Source: AAP / Joel Carrett Aldi was still the cheapest when factoring in specials, with the price remaining the same as the basket without specials at $72.41. The Woolworths' specials basket was $93.17, Coles' $100.04, and IGA's $105.38.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not entirely a like-for-like comparison, with Choice saying that in order to compare the same products as often as it could, the baskets from Coles, Woolworths and IGA contained more name-brand products than the Aldi basket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Buying more home-brand products from these supermarkets would bring the cost down, but we also know that shoppers often choose national-brand products when entertaining,\" Choice said.\n\n\n\nWhere can you get the freshest lettuce?\n\nTo determine which supermarket had the freshest produce, the group also compared the freshness of mixed lettuce two days after buying across all four supermarkets.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoice said it can't answer the question for every item, but looked at lettuce because it shows signs of decay quickly.\n\n\n\nColes came out on top, with 77 per cent of its mystery shoppers saying its lettuce leaves were fresh after two days. Woolworths, IGA and Aldi followed respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In this survey, there was some evidence of decay in the mixed lettuce purchased at all supermarkets, but Coles ultimately received the highest score for freshness,\" Serrels said.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoice advised shoppers hoping to reduce their costs to shop around, check unit pricing, and opt for cheaper alternatives like meat cuts, frozen fruit and vegetables, and \"imperfect\" ranges.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "In the context of the challenge she had set herself in New Zealand, it is not so much about the ability to withstand pain, but looking within to find the strength to go on. \u201cSisu as a word, it literally means when translated insides, the intestines. It is to understand what and who we are,\u201d she says. Key to this is quietening the expectations of the outside world and listening to ourselves. \u201cSisu is unique as a concept in psychology because in Finnish culture sisu is not just a word that denotes tenacity or this inner resilience and great perseverance, but it also has this flavour of moral correctness and integrity,\u201d Lahti says. \u201cYou do something and you do it really well, even when no one is watching.\u201d Despite depictions in popular culture \u2013 there was an action film called Sisu released in 2022 \u2013 Lahti says true sisu is quiet, contemplative and even gentle. The concept has applications for Australians.\n\nLoading Podcaster Susanna Heiskanen \u2013 author of Nordic Lifestyle: Embrace Slow Living, Cultivate Happiness and Know When to Take off Your Shoes \u2013 sees many similarities between Australians and Finns. \u201cWhen I moved [to Australia] in 2008, I was surprised by how similar these two nations really are. After living 10 years in the UK, it was lovely to discover the shared love of nature between Australians and Finns \u2013 nature is truly important to both cultures. \u201cThe relaxed attitude towards life, people being respectful and kind, always interested in the world around them \u2013 these similar traits made me feel at home from the start.\u201d Susanna Heiskanen says she has seen sisu in action in Australia as communities face adversity like natural disasters together. Credit: Brett Hemmings/Getty Images\n\nBut she has also seen the way Australians unknowingly tap into the tradition of sisu, most tellingly when conditions push people to the brink and communities come together to support each other through hard times. \u201cI see a communal spirit here in Australia that mirrors sisu,\u201d Heiskanen says. \u201cLooking at disaster-affected areas, I see sisu in action \u2013 people working together towards a common goal, using their inner strength to get through flood or bushfire-ravaged lives, rebuilding their livelihoods and homes.\u201d It\u2019s a philosophy that Finns continue to draw upon to withstand difficulties, apparently against the odds, she says. \u201cSisu is a collective determination that the nation has in abundance,\u201d she says. \u201cI recently saw a documentary about Finnish preparedness against occupation or war \u2013 the underground tunnels and halls that are used daily for sports, parking and children\u2019s activities, but can house more people than the entire population of Helsinki. That\u2019s resilience in action: planning ahead and making sure you\u2019re prepared no matter what. \u201cSisu is also taught in schools as a concept when discussing history and the meaning of perseverance. We Finns have learned not to give up even when logic says we should. The 1939 Winter War against Russia is a powerful example of this national character.\u201d\n\nLoading Both women talk about the true strength of sisu being not just in the ability to push on, but also to stop. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can ever have too much sisu. It\u2019s your superpower for happiness, and there\u2019s never too much happiness in the world,\u201d Heiskanen says. \u201cThat said, true sisu also means knowing when to rest and regroup \u2013 it\u2019s sustained strength, not reckless stubbornness.\u201d For Lahti, when pounding the NZ asphalt, the ultimate reckoning came when she listened to what her body was telling her. \u201cIt was a Guiness World Record pursuit and people were watching it, so it was a pressure. But there is always a thing of \u2018are we listening to the drumbeat outside or is it our own?\u2019 That\u2019s where the whole thing shifted for me and that\u2019s where our sisu becomes sustainable, when we listen to ourselves.\u201d",
