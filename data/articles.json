        "text": "aprilU\ufeffS President Donald Trump has flagged his intention to sue the BBC for up to $US5 billion ($7.7 billion) over its documentary edit, despite receiving an apology from the broadcaster.\n\nThe BBC apologised to the president after airing an edited \ufeffversion of his speech on January 6, 2021, splicing two parts of his address which took place almost an hour apart.\n\nIn a letter to Trump, the British broadcaster's chair Samir Shah personally apologised for the edit of the speech and accepted it \"unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech\".\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to reporters on Air Force One on his way to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach. (AP)\n\nTrump's lawyer had previously sent the BBC a letter demanding an apology and threatened to file a US$1 billion ($1.5 billion) lawsuit.\n\nThe president said he still plans to sue the BBC, potentially now for a much larger sum.\n\n\ufeff\"We'll sue them for anywhere between a billion and five billion dollars, probably some time next week. I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.\n\n\"They've even admitted that they cheated.\"\n\nThe legal dispute was sparked by an edition of the BBC's flagship current affairs series Panorama , titled \"Trump: A Second Chance?\" broadcast days before the 2024 US presidential election.\n\nA third-party production company spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \"fight like hell.\"\n\nThe US president said he still plans to sue the BBC, potentially now for a much larger sum. (Jack Taylor/Reuters)\n\nAmong the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.\n\nTrump earlier declared the BBC was \"fake\ufeff news\", adding that the people of the UK are \"very angry\" about the edit.\n\nHe said he would raise the issue with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.\n\n\"I'm going to call him over the weekend. He actually put a call in to me. He's very embarrassed,\" Trump said.\ufeff\n\nDirector-general Tim Davie, along with news chief Deborah Turness, quit on Sunday, saying the scandal was damaging the BBC and \"as the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.\"",

        "text": "Dr Maheer Shah didn't even want to be a dentist; now he's using his dentistry skills to run a six-figure side hustle making jewellery for your teeth.\n\nGrillz are removable dental accessories often made from gold and diamonds and Shah is the founder of one of Australia's only grillz businesses, Dr Grillz.\n\nHe can charge up to $5000 for a single removable set and right now, business is booming.\ufeff\n\nDr. Maheer Shah is a leading Perth dentist specialising in aesthetic dentistry - and making grillz on the side. (Supplied)\n\n\"Now I'm getting this demand for permanent work,\" Shah told 9news.com.au.\n\n\"I think the culture is moving in that direction \u2013 everyone's got so many tattoos now, and piercings, the permanent gold teeth and diamond teeth is probably the next phase.\"\n\nBorn in Nairobi and raised in the suburbs of Perth, Shah decided to pursue dentistry after hearing that a schoolmate's dentist dad only had to work three days a week.\n\nHe went in blind and admitted he didn't have much \"natural talent\". \ufeff\n\nBut he persevered and completed his degree in 2015.\n\nThe idea for Dr Grillz\ufeff struck him just a few weeks later, when he went to see his favourite DJs perform.\n\n\"I won some backstage passes, so I met them before their show and they had grillz in,\" Shah said.\n\nThese are grillz, removable dental accessories often made from gold and diamonds. (Supplied)\n\nWhen he asked about the accessories, the DJs confessed they travelled abroad to buy them because grillz were so hard to find in Australia.\n\nShah immediately saw it as an opportunity.\n\nAfter the show, his mates wanted grillz of their own, so he connected with designers and jewellers to create them.\n\nIt became a hobby, one he shared online via his Dr Grillz Instagram page.\n\nMost of the dentists he worked with called it a \"gimmick\", insisting it wouldn't amount to anything.\n\nBut Shah's social media page had started to gain traction.\n\nBefore long, total strangers were reaching out to order custom grillz.\n\nStill working full-time as a dentist, Shah slowly built a team of designers, jewellers and technicians to help bring each set of custom grillz to life.\n\nShah has built a team of jewellers, designers and technicians who keep Dr Grillz going. (Supplied)\n\nHe did most of the work for Dr Grillz between appointments or on weekends, but Shah didn't mind dedicating that time to a creative outlet.\n\nAnd at up to $5000 a pop, grillz were becoming a lucrative little side hustle.\n\n\"A little silver tooth would maybe be $200 or $300, and if you wanted a little tooth gem that's somewhere between $30 and $50,\" Shah explained.\n\n\"But then, when the pieces start to get bigger, covering multiple teeth, then it'll move to that $500 to $1000 mark.\n\n\"And then when you add diamonds, or if they're very big pieces, it goes into the thousands \u2013 up to $5000.\"\n\nHe charges even more for permanent work, though it's not something he does often.\n\n\ufeffOn one occasion, Shah created a custom gold and diamond implant worth several thousand dollars to replace a patient's missing tooth.\n\nThis gold and diamond permanent tooth implant was created to fill the place where a client was missing a tooth. (Supplied)\n\nBut he's reluctant to do anything permanent that could damage a patient's natural smile \u2013 even though he could charge tens of thousands for it.\n\n\ufeff\"I'm still a dentist, my job is to protect your teeth,\" Shah said.\n\nDr Grillz is now a six-figure business and Shah will soon be opening a grillz studio in the Perth suburb of Northbridge.\n\nGetting to this point hasn't been easy but the challenges he's faced building this side hustle are nothing compared to his day job.\n\n\"The mishaps you have in dentistry, the complications and pain and bleeding, is a way worse headache than grillz ever will be,\" he said.\n\n\ufeffAt least his Dr Grillz clients are happy to see him \u2013 unlike many of the patients he sees working full-time across two private dentistry practices.\n\n\ufeff\"When you work as a dentist, no one's really that excited to see you,\" Shah laughed.\n\nAustralian musician Mia Rodriguez shows off a custom set of grillz from Dr Grillz. (Supplied)\n\nBut he never considered giving up work as a dentist to focus on Dr Grillz alone.\n\nAbout 55 per cent of Australians are currently earning money from a side hustle, or actively considering starting one, according to Westpac data.\n\nLike many of them, \ufeffShah has had to play it smart with his money to keep his business going.\n\nWithout his salary as a dentist to fall back on, he doubts Dr Grillz would be as successful as it is today \u2013 if at all.\n\n\ufeffHe urged other Aussies looking to build a brand or make cash on the side not to dive into a side hustle without considering how they'll pay rent when business is slow.\n\nShah encouraged other Aussies pursuing side hustles to keep their day jobs and focus on making smart money decisions. (Supplied)\n\nBecause there's nothing \ufeffthat can kill a small business quicker than poor financial planning.\n\n\"If you can have a job that pays your bills and things like that, then all the money your side hustle makes, you can reinvest into the business,\" he said.\n\n\"And even if that business doesn't grow into something that makes you $1 million, it will lead you into that next thing that might be the golden ticket for you.\"\n\nHave you got a story?

        "text": "The federal government is facing yet another call to overhaul the GST, with new research outlining the tremendous amount of unfairness baked into the current system.\n\nThe GST is the federal budget's third-largest source of income, behind income and company tax .\n\nFor 2022-23, the ATO collected $81.7 billion of it; the last federal budget forecast that figure will rise to $94.1 billion this financial year, and again to close to $100 billion in 2026-27.\n\nAustralians pay close to $100 billion in GST every year. But some cough up far more than others. (Photograph by Chris Hopkins)\n\nWhile ostensibly a flat 10 per cent rate on all goods and services sold, the number of exemptions on certain products means some Australians are paying almost 50 per cent more GST than others, even though they have similar spending habits.\n\nThe findings were published in a new report from the e61-UNSW Policy Research Partnership earlier this week, which outlined the levels of inequity in the current arrangements.\n\n\"Only around half of items attract GST,\" study co-author Dr Matt Nolan said.\n\n\"Our research finds these exemptions are causing a significant inequity where households which spend or earn similar amounts overall end up paying hugely different amounts of tax.\"\n\nAccording to the report, the amount of GST paid by low-spending households, who spend an average of $15,222 a year, ranges from $729 to $1354 \u2013 a difference of 46 per cent.\n\nFor an average household with about $37,500 in yearly expenses, there's a 37 per cent difference between the lowest and highest GST bills.\n\nThat figure eases again to 33 per cent for the highest-spending households, although in dollar terms that represents a difference of more than $2500 a year.\n\nThis is a clear example of \"horizontal inequity\", Nolan and fellow co-author Josh Clyne wrote, which brought about two clear issues in the tax system.\n\n\"As a fairness principle, horizontal inequity is bad as it involves making households contribute different amounts of tax when they have the same means to pay,\" the authors wrote.\n\n\"In terms of efficiency, taxing different consumption choices differently encourages people to change their decisions about what to consume solely due to taxation \u2013 leading households and firms to organise themselves in inefficient ways to avoid the tax (i.e. supermarkets no longer offering warm cooked chickens to focus on the untaxed cold cooked chicken substitute).\"\n\nFresh food is exempt from GST, but other food products aren't. (Dominic Lorrimer/AFR)\n\nA wide range of goods and services are currently exempt from GST, including fresh food, private health insurance, childcare, sunscreen, and charitable donations.\n\nNolan said a select few are the main culprits driving the inequity.\n\n\"For households with low spending or income, the main cause of the divergence is the type of food they buy,\" he said.\n\n\"While for high-spending and high-income households, exemptions for education and child care play a larger role.\"\n\nThe GST has frequently come under fire this year from economists who argue it needs to be broadened, given both sides of politics want to reduce income taxes despite the federal budget being in structural deficit.\n\nConsumption taxes are seen to do relatively little economic damage, and compared to other nations', the GST is relatively low, at 10 per cent compared to the OECD average of 19.4.\n\nUNSW economist Richard Holden and teal independent MP Kate Chaney put forward a proposal in August to increase the GST to 15 per cent and remove all exemptions from it .\n\nUnder the proposal, every adult would receive a $3300 \"basics rebate\", effectively providing a $22,000 GST-free threshold to ensure low-income households weren't left worse off.\n\nSimilarly, Nolan and Clyne called for all exemptions to be removed and to provide an annual rebate of around $900 to all adults, while keeping the rate set at 10 per cent.\n\nThey said the measure would be budget-neutral and remove the unfairness of the current system.\n\n\"In this scenario, people who earn and spend less are made better off, while those who are higher earners and spenders end up contributing additional tax,\" Clyne said.\n\n\"This is just one example of how GST could be redesigned so it no longer depends on what people buy.\n\n\"The exact form of compensation is up for debate, but it's clear we can reduce these horizontal inequities without punishing the most vulnerable.\"",

        "text": "Chaos has marred the T100 professional triathlon event in Dubai, with athletes confused over the number of laps they had completed on the bike and run legs.\n\nNew Zealand's Olympic silver medallist Hayden Wilde was the biggest casualty, the series leader missing the turn-off towards the second transition zone while leading the bike leg.\n\n\"He's missed the turn,\" Jack Kelly said in disbelief on commentary.\n\n\"Oh my God, he has missed transition. Jesus Christ Hayden, what are you doing?,\" added Jan Frodeno in co-coms.\n\n\"You're wrong buddy.\"\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nAccording to some social media posts, it appeared there were cones still covering the entrance to the transition when Wilde passed it.\n\nRegardless of why he missed the turn though, Wilde, second-placed Frenchman Mathis Margirier and Belgian Marten Van Riel all had to complete an extra 8 kilometre lap, with no opportunity to either communicate their error or for the trio to turn back.\n\n\"Guys seriously, how can you do this?\" the commentator said.\n\nPreviously fourth-place British athlete Sam Dickinson rolled into transition and looked desperately confused as to where the leaders had gone, before setting off on the 18km run leg.\n\n\"I don't think they'll know what's happened,\" the commentator said as the new leading trio looked around at the empty bike stands on course.\n\nWilde, meanwhile, was left even more confused when he arrived in transition to see that he was not in the lead as he had expected.\n\n\"What's going on?\" he shouted at a spectator as he set out on the first of eight laps of the 18km run leg.\n\n\"You've done one extra lap on the bike,\" the spectator was heard shouting back.\n\n\"F***'s sake. That's bullshit,\" he said.\n\nLater in the run, he came up to race leader Morgan Pearson and asked him, \"What's going on?\"\n\n\"Apparently you did an extra lap,\" Pearson said.\n\n\"We did not. We were at 76k,\" Wilde replied.\n\n\"Were you?\" a stunned Pearson said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Wilde spat in disgust, racing on to try to limit the damage.\n\nHe completed the fastest run leg by far with 49:19 for the 18km, but finished eighth.\n\nIncredibly, that wasn't the last of the confusion.\n\nRun leg brings more chaos\n\nTowards the end of the eight-lap run leg, while the cameras focused on race leader Pearson, who was seemingly all set to win his first T100 race, footage immediately cut to German Mika Noodt crossing the line and raising the winner's tape.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\n\"No buddy, you have not won this race. Oh my god,\" the commentators said on the coverage as Noodt shrugged his shoulders, looked around and then could be seen asking \"have I won?\" on the footage.\n\n\"What is going on here?\" said the co-commentator as Noodt shrugged his shoulders again and looked around before somewhat sheepishly celebrating.\n\n\"We're trying to work this out,\" the first commentator said, clearly baffled at what had taken place.\n\n\"Has Morgan Pearson now counted wrong as well?,\" the commentator postulated, trying to make sense of this latest turn of events.\n\n\"We're still trying to work out exactly what has happened here.\"\n\nSam Dickinson and Vincent Luis soon arrived behind Noodt, thinking they too had finished the race.\n\nConfused, they then watched the arrival of Pearson, who was shocked to see that his winning moment had seemingly passed him by, hijacked by people he thought were behind him in the race.\n\nStream End Game with Tony Armstrong on ABC iview Tony Armstrong tackles Australia's overdue reckoning with racism in sport with the help of some of its biggest sports stars.\n\nWilde eventually flew home after a blistering run but was absolutely furious and demanded that the cameras leave him alone.\n\nMore than an hour passed as several athletes protested the result, with Pearson eventually crowned as winner.\n\nThe issue was a faulty lap counter, with World Triathlon and the Professional Triathletes Organisation (PTO) releasing a statement to that effect.\n\n\"Due to a technical issue with the lap counting board and timing, the official result for the Dubai T100 Men's race was determined after the 7th lap, which was the last known timing and follows World Triathlon guidelines,\" it read.\n\nAlthough Pearson was justifiably crowned the winner, the organisers will be left red faced by the shambolic finish to the event.\n\nNoodt was awarded second and Gregory Barnaby third. Luis was fifth, behind Jason West.\n\nThe T100 is a relatively new format, middle-distance race featuring a 2km swim, 80km bike and 18km run organised by the PTO, taking place around the world, with an event set for the Gold Coast in March 2026.\n\nOlympic triathlon distances are 1.5km run, 40km bike and 10km run, while traditional half iron-distance races feature a 1.9km swim, 90km bike and 21km run.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation.

It was the best time of my life,\" he said.\n\nAllysa, 18, also faced challenges during her schooling.\n\nAllysa says she had a good experience with alternative learning after being bullied in high school. (BTN High: Joseph Baronio)\n\n\"From like the start of year seven, I didn't have a very good start to high school.\n\n\"[I was] relentlessly bullied all year, and I just needed a way out,\" she said.\n\nAllysa found her comfort in alternative learning, attending Yuille Park Community College, where she is the only year 12 student and the first to complete the Victorian Pathway Certificate.\n\nAllysa said she was grateful for the opportunities alternative learning had given her.\n\nShe said other people could benefit from hearing how it had helped her.\n\nJohn, 16, also attends Yuille Park Community College. He left home at 15, and his story is about becoming more independent.\n\nHe said it was important for others to hear stories like his because it might give them the confidence to speak up about their situations and raise awareness for youth mental health.\n\nThey are just three of more than 600 students from across Ballarat who have submitted their stories to ABC Takeover.\n\nJohn is sharing his story about leaving home at 15. (BTN High: Joseph Baronio)\n\nWhat is Takeover?\n\nTakeover is a storytelling competition created to give young people aged 15 to 19 in regional areas the skills and platform to share their unique personal stories with the rest of the country.\n\nIt is run by a team that is also responsible for Heywire, a similar youth storytelling initiative for people aged 16 to 22 that has been running since 1998.\n\nWhile Takeover has not been around as long, starting in 2022, the competition has broadcast the stories of 240 young people who live, work or study in Shepparton, Mildura, Melbourne, Lismore, Latrobe Valley, the WA Goldfields, and Burnie.\n\nTakeover has broadcast the stories of more than 200 young people, including in WA's Goldfields. (ABC: Mark Eiden)\n\nNow, the Takeover team has its sights set on Ballarat, where students such as Allysa say it can be hard for young people to have their experiences and opinions heard.\n\n\"It probably doesn't get out as much being the town it is,\" she said.\n\nHer classmate, John, 16, said, \"Mostly, everyone in Ballarat does go to Melbourne or interstate just to get their voice heard.\"\n\nHow does it work?\n\nTakeover begins by carefully choosing an area to host its events to make sure they have maximum impact, by considering things such as the youth population, number of government schools, diversity, and socio-economic status.\n\nSinging helped me survive depression and brain surgery Singing saw me through severe depression and brain surgery.\n\nOnce an area is chosen, Takeover facilitators visit schools and community groups and get to know the participants, asking things such as what brings them joy, what home means to them, what challenges they have had to overcome, and their strengths or skills they are working on.\n\nAnswers and ideas from those questions become stories and ultimately submissions for the Takeover competition.\n\nOnce written, the long process of reading each entry begins. There are more than 600 entries from Ballarat alone.\n\nJust 35 winners will be chosen.\n\nSix hundred entries in Ballarat will be whittled down to 35 winners. (BTN High: Joseph Baronio)\n\nA panel of judges, including members of the local community and previous Takeover and Heywire alumni, helps pick the winners.\n\nSwathi Shanmukhasundaram, who is a producer from Takeover, said narrowing it down could be very tricky.\n\n\"There are multiple things that go into it. The most important thing is: is this young person passionate about the thing that they're sharing? Is there a story structure in there that the producer can play with? And some of our best entries come from stories that were two lines.\"\n\nSwathi Shanmukhasundaram says young people, who do not see themselves as leaders, grow through Takeover. (Supplied: Swathi Shanmukhasundaram)\n\nThe winning stories are then broadcast on ABC television and radio.\n\nTakeover ends with a five-day summit that showcases the 35 winners' stories, with a red-carpet screening and ideas presentation.\n\nThe winners can talk with leaders about how to make their communities a better place to grow up in.\n\n\"They get leadership development, they get opportunities, and they're not always related to what's in their story,\" Swathi said.\n\n\"Sometimes it's about funding for their community, about learning something new, making friends. You never know what will come out of it.\n\n\" The growth that I've been able to see in some of the young people who don't traditionally see themselves as leaders is probably the most beautiful outcome for me. \"\n\nThe Takeover Ballarat Summit will take place in June 2026, and entrants such as Pat, 15, from Ballarat Specialist School say it will be an important event for the community and young people across the country.\n\nPat says it is important young people have an opportunity to talk about how they feel.

(ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\n\"The market is very strong; there's a lot of natural migration,\" he said.\n\n\" People have identified that hospitality businesses, both hotels, motels and caravan parks, are a good source of income; it's a growing market, it's somewhere to live and do business. \"\n\nIn the nearby town of Longreach, a privately owned Australian hotel and property group has been snapping up businesses.\n\nWaymark Hotels now owns two pubs and a restaurant in the popular tourist town.\n\nBut Winton sales have remained with individual buyers.\n\nBernie Hogan, chief executive of the Queensland Hotels Association, said interest in regional hotels had increased in the past 18 months.\n\n\"I think people have realised what great businesses they are, what great investments they can be \u2026 and, as always, people \u2026 are looking for that change of lifestyle,\" he said.\n\n\"There are many success stories of people heading west and loving it.\"\n\nThe Australian Hotel in Winton was sold earlier this year. (ABC Western Qld: Hannah Walsh)\n\nBut Mr Hogan said running a regional pub was still challenging, with rising costs and transient staff.\n\nMr Faiers said sales worked in a cyclical nature.\n\n\"It's pretty typical what we see in the market \u2014 when somebody sells a business, other local business people are surprised with the value \u2026 it makes them start to think about their position and what their next steps are,\" he said.\n\n\"The cost of buildings [are] not dissimilar to housing, it's hard to get something built.\n\n\"That's helped the older buildings and businesses become more valuable, the structure is already in place.\"",

So, we're going to keep advocating for the Pacific COP,\" she said.\n\n\"What I would say is, this does need to be resolved.\"\n\nDecision set for coming week\n\nThe government has already spent $7 million preparing to host the conference, Mr Bowen said on Saturday before he departed for Brazil.\n\nHe also confirmed that a decision would be made this week, noting that Australia had \"overwhelming support\" for its bid.\n\nBut because the decision was not made through a traditional ballot process, he said, the government would have to reach an agreement with T\u00fcrkiye.\n\n\"That makes it difficult,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"I'll continue to have conversations with my Turkish counterparts in consultation with the Pacific over the next week or so, and we'll see how we go.\"\n\nThe government has said it wants to use COP31 to highlight urgent climate threats faced by Pacific nations and champion their calls for more ambitious action.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye has previously proposed sharing the COP presidency with Australia, but the ABC understands the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Secretariat has made it clear that co-presidencies are not permitted under its rules.\n\nClimate change debate swirls at home\n\nThe last ditch push for COP comes as climate change and emissions reduction dominated domestic political debate, after the Liberal Party this week announced it would join the Nationals in ditching its commitment to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nSenator Wong on Sunday characterised the opposition's decision as \"trying to outflank Pauline Hanson\".\n\n\"And what I'd say to Sussan Ley \u2014 and to Andrew Hastie and to Angus Taylor \u2014 is you can't be more Pauline than Pauline,\" she said.\n\nThe conundrum at the core of the Coalition's net zero backflip Liberal shadow cabinet members landed on a plan that has left many inside and outside the party bewildered and confused.\n\nShe added that the opposition's \"confused, divided\" approach to climate policy would result in higher costs for Australians, while the Coalition has argued that ditching the target is necessary to bring down power prices.\n\nThe prime minister also took aim at the Coalition during a press conference on Sunday, describing its approach to climate and energy policy as a \"clown show\".\n\n\"The real problem is that that kills off investment certainty, that kills off investment, and less investment means higher power prices,\" he said.\n\nOpposition Leader Sussan Ley this week confirmed the party would remain in the Paris Agreement and would continue to set five-yearly interim targets from government.\n\nAnd while the party would not actively strive for net zero, she said reaching it would be \"welcome\".\n\nThe Coalition will hold a joint-partyroom meeting on Sunday to determine a final policy.\n\nLiberal frontbencher Jonathan Duniam, who is part of the team leading the negotiations, said the ultimate decision would be in line with what the two parties had already announced.\n\n\"The key difference between our approach to this, and the government's, is we're focused on energy affordability,\" he said.\n\n\"They're focused on emissions reductions, no matter the cost.

(ABC News: Brendan Esposito)\n\nWhen the stories came to a head on Wednesday, WA Labor MP Sabine Winton diligently defended the government despite having little to do with the decisions behind these particular issues.\n\n\"We're not going to shy away from difficult conversations,\" she said.\n\nBut critics say that is exactly what the government is trying to do.\n\nPath to self-destruction?\n\nLawyer slams government's Dion Barber appeal A lawyer accuses the WA government of hijacking a case of historical sexual abuse to \"clarify law\", instead of legislating it through parliament, because it would be \"political suicide\".\n\nIn 2018 the WA government removed the time limit for survivors of historical sexual abuse to take legal action.\n\nThe government made it easier for abuse survivors to seek justice and now, surprise, surprise, more abuse survivors are seeking justice, and the state may have to fork out more in compensation.\n\nThe state of Western Australia is taking Dion Barber's $2.8 million compensation case back to court to try and limit its potential liability in future cases, or as the government keeps saying, to \"clarify points of law\".\n\nDion Barber was abused by his stepfather as a boy, taken into state care, and then sent back to live with him again. (ABC News: David Weber)\n\nThe government could try to seek clarity by introducing legislation through parliament, according to abuse lawyer Juliana Fiorucci, but won't.\n\n\"Because doing so flies in the face of celebrating being the government that enacted the legislation to allow these claims to pass in the first place,\" Ms Fiorucci said.\n\n\" That would be political suicide. \"\n\nRight or wrong, it seems the government may be trying to protect its bottom line while avoiding the difficult conversations.\n\n\"Some might say pursuing the appeal in those circumstances could be an abuse of process,\" Ms Fiorucci said.\n\nJuliana Fioruccia says the government could seek clarity by introducing legislation through parliament. (ABC News: Cason Ho)\n\nAttorney General Tony Buti said while he acknowledged Mr Barber's courage, it would be inappropriate to comment further as the matter was before the courts.\n\nIt doesn't look great when the government gives with one hand, but takes with the other, which may be why it seems like it's trying to keep the issue at arm's length.\n\nPremier Roger Cook literally said the appeal of Mr Barber's case was \"at arm's length\" because it was being sought by the government's insurance arm, the Insurance Commission of WA.\n\nSecret report altered\n\nIn another potential example of keeping its distance, the government quietly released a secret report this week that was supposed to justify claims WA's fossil fuels are critical to helping the rest of the world reach net zero.\n\nOne would think the government would jump on the opportunity to laud a $402,000 report it commissioned that supported its campaign to expand WA's gas industry.\n\nThe role of gas in Australia's energy transition is heavily contested. (ABC News: Andrew Seabourne)\n\nBut the report was tabled in parliament \u2014 eight months after it was finalised \u2014 just days after a draft version was leaked highlighting the \"substantial\" risk that WA's gas could hamper the transition to renewables.\n\nThe problem is, the government published the final report with changes throughout, which could be clearly compared to the original draft.\n\nAmong the changes, Asia's projected gas consumption was altered dramatically (it somehow doubled), and language describing the risks of gas was softened.\n\nThe government insisted the report by consultancy firm Deloitte \"was drafted and revised independent of government\", and said both the draft and the final versions supported its claims about the need for WA's gas \u2014 a claim rejected by the WA Greens.\n\nSophie McNeill says the tabled report downplays the risks of fossil fuels. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)\n\n\"They sat on it for months, they hid it from the public, and now they've come out with a version that downplays the risks,\" WA Greens MLC Sophie McNeill said.\n\n\"I just can't believe what an own goal this is by the government.\"\n\nUnited front under strain\n\nThere are questions to be asked about the veracity of these consultancy reports that underpin government policy.\n\nWhat has become clearer, however, is the longer a government is in power, the more difficult it is not to contort itself.\n\nIn the last week alone, an insider leaked the confidential gas report, and Labor backbencher Dave Kelly publicly spoke out against the appeal of Dion Barber's case \u2014 rarities in a government known for its solidarity.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this week's events are just blips, or fractures in a government wading through its third term in power.",

Like her spectacular lead performance, it simply cannot be ignored.\n\n\"Let's start with the easy ones,\" she says with a hearty guffaw, her Australian accent only occasionally twanging with adopted American intonations.\n\n\" The ceiling is the show-stopper. It's so funny, because someone said to me that it's like an existential birth canal. \"\n\nFunnily enough, in one trippy sequence, Linda stares up into the chasm and sees strange swirling lights that may or may not be there, spookily responding: \"Mum?\"\n\nByrne expands: \"It's not not an existential birth canal, that's for sure. I live for the weirder aspects of filmmaking and the grey areas \u2014 the parts of being a person that are unexplainable.\"\n\n\"Mary definitely pushes the limits of that with this movie, which is very Lynchian,\" she says, referencing the late American filmmaker who created the weird and wonderful Twin Peaks.\n\nToo many voices\n\nLynchian is a great way to sum up If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, which brilliantly functions on more than one level.\n\nSure, there are surreal moments, but on the surface, it's just a very bad day in the life of Linda.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nAn exasperated therapist with enough of her own stuff going on at home, Linda can be brusque towards her clients. They include fellow US-based Australian actor Danielle Macdonald's clearly drowning new mum, Caroline.\n\n\"Danielle's is such a fantastic performance, embodying a woman in a deep, postpartum psychosis,\" Byrne says.\n\n\"It's heartbreaking, and Linda isn't helping.\"\n\nThat's partly because no-one is helping Linda.\n\nHer husband (Christian Slater) is a captain away at sea, full of not-so-supportive suggestions on the phone while she struggles to single-handedly manage the health care of their persistently heard but almost-never-seen daughter (Delaney Quinn).\n\nLinda is harangued by the beep of her daughter's feeding tube, connected to a mysterious ailment that's never named. She also has to battle with a snooty social worker (played by Bronstein) who constantly questions her medical choices.\n\nAt work, her colleague, who is also her therapist, is equally dismissive. Chat show host Conan O'Brien plays him in a chameleonic turn.\n\nTalk-show royalty Conan O'Brien plays Linda's contemptuous therapist. (Supplied: A24)\n\n\"It's such a wink, because Conan's spent 20 years having someone in that chair, listening to, laughing at and indulging them,\" Byrne says.\n\n\"Then, in this, he actively has contempt for his patient, which is so funny, and Conan's razor-sharp wit shines through.\"\n\nWhen the sky falls in, Linda's spiralling panic attack sees her and her daughter cooped up in a seedy motel.\n\nIn desperate need of peace, Linda's further frustrated by the pedant working at the front desk (Ivy Wolk), who refuses to sell her wine because ringing it up will creep past the licence.\n\nSo, Linda turns to rapper A$AP Rocky's motel manager for help with securing other means to dull her pain.\n\n\"Rocky fills the screen with charm, with that quality that you can't direct,\" Byrne says.\n\n\"You just have it, or you don't, and that brings relief to the audience. Suddenly, you can breathe.\"\n\nAnd breathe\n\nBreathing easy won't last in a film that's way more into hyperventilating.\n\nRose Byrne plays a mother on the edge in If I Had Legs I'd Kick You. (Supplied: Logan White / Courtesy of A24)\n\n\"The day-to-day minutia can tip you into the darkest part of your soul,\" Byrne, a mother of two, says.\n\n\" That's what makes the film so extraordinary and darkly funny \u2014 that tightrope comedy between the hugest questions and the tiniest little grievances. \"\n\nEverything from a screaming abandoned babe to a feral hamster on the loose to that gunk-raining chasm in her roof pushes Linda to her limits.\n\n\"Mary's vision was to ramp up this fever-pitch tension that adds up to a car crash, but you can't look away,\" Byrne says.\n\nBronstein told Byrne that no matter how wild Linda's responses to these rolling catastrophes get, we had to stay on her side.\n\n\"We might hate or be disgusted by her actions, but I said to Rose, 'The number one thing is, we love Linda',\" Bronstein says.\n\n\"It doesn't work if there's no empathy.\"\n\nBronstein had complete trust in her star.\n\n\"When Rose came on, it became a movie,\" Bronstein says.\n\nMary Bronstein says Rose Byrne brings a certain depth to the role that couldn't have come from anyone else. (Supplied: A24)\n\n\"She's a true creative partner. She's a serious theatre actor who's played Medea, and she's a gifted comedian as well.\n\n\"I was given a gift to have her talent.\"\n\nA career with legs\n\nByrne grew up in Balmain and cut her teeth in the movie Dallas Doll alongside Sandra Bernhard and Two Hands with the late Heath Ledger.\n\n\"We were just kids starting out, and it's beyond my wildest dreams I'm still doing it,\" Byrne says.\n\n\"More and more, it feels like a miracle, what with AI, and I have so many friends who are out-of-work crew members.\"\n\nAs Bridesmaids star Byrne sees it, comedy kicked her career into high gear.\n\n\"It was a huge creative turning point,\" Byrne says.\n\n\"It felt freeing, and also more challenging. Something I can really sink my teeth into.\"\n\nRose Byrne and Heath Ledger take a break from celebrating Two Hands at the Sundance Film Festival in 1999. (Lindsay Brice / Getty Images)\n\nFor every excruciating moment in If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, there\u2019s a laugh-out-loud chaser.\n\nDebuting at Sundance in January, it went on to the Berlin International Film Festival, where Byrne was awarded the Silver Bear for Best Leading Performance. There's already Oscars buzz.\n\n\"It's very surreal, because I've never been in this conversation,\" Byrne says.\n\n\"Of course it's flattering, and I'm as vulnerable as the next person in this business. But I've also realised it's out of my hands. I'm just honoured to be part of the conversation.\"\n\nLaughing at herself as much as anyone else allows me to end on a slightly cheekier note. Is Bobby Cannavale \u2014 who also starred in Medea \u2014 a more supportive husband than the frankly useless one played by Slater?\n\n\"That's not cheeky at all,\" Byrne says, with a hearty chuckle. \"Bobby's hyper-present, completely engaged.\"\n\nIf I Had Legs I'd Kick You is in cinemas now.",

No tents, only a tarp in case it rains,\" Rivi said.\n\nJump to the Survival Camping Quiz\n\nHe also carries a satellite phone to contact his parents, who were hesitant at first but have come to trust his skills and judgement.\n\nWhile camping, Rivi said respecting the environment came first \u2014 leave the forest as its found and carefully return any fallen trees used for shelter. (Supplied)\n\nThe Tasmanian terrain is known for its harsh elements, so much so, its West Coast Range was chosen to test contestants on SBS's survival reality show, Alone Australia.\n\nBut Rivi's love for survival-inspired camping didn't come from TV \u2014 it began on a camping trip with his friend Harrison.\n\nThe pair went hiking deep in the forest, which meant carrying only the essentials.\n\nOriginally from Gampaha, Sri Lanka, Rivi didn\u2019t grow up camping, but he hopes to join the Defence Force after falling in love with Australia\u2019s wilderness. (ABC News: Marc Eiden)\n\n\"Because we were walking over an hour into the forest, we had to get rid of a lot of gear \u2014 that's when it changed to 'survival mode,'\" Rivi said.\n\nFor Rivi, it is less about exploring the area and more about creating a temporary home off the main tracks, sitting in silence, and putting his problem-solving skills to the test as conditions change.\n\n\"The more I'm away from my phone and distractions, the more I'm connected to what matters,\" he said.\n\n\" I've realised that the more I seek discomfort, the more comfortable I feel in myself.

        "text": "Sydney Sixers rising star Caoimhe Bray needed to be told she had claimed a hat-trick, as the 16-year-old added another WBBL highlight in a thumping derby defeat of the Thunder.\n\nBray took her wickets across two overs, the third thanks to a fantastic diving catch at point from Erin Burns.\n\nThe excitement of that wicket may have been to blame for Bray and her teammates not knowing she had completed a hat-trick.\n\nThey were all shocked to hear of the feat when the ground announcer informed the crowd over the speakers.\n\nBray finished with 4-15 from her four overs, helping the Sixers record a 24-run win over the Thunder at Sydney's Drummoyne Oval on Saturday night.\n\n\"It's pretty crazy \u2026 I didn't realise,\" said Bray, who is also the Junior Matildas goalkeeper.\n\n\"It was one of those weird ones that was at the end of the over.\"\n\nMaitlan Brown (2-18) was also effective on a night that favoured the bowlers.\n\nBut the Sixers will wait on scans for New Zealand all-rounder Amelia Kerr, who injured her quad in the warm-up and was forced out of the match.\n\nThe Sixers had Sophie Dunkley (43 off 35) and Mady Villiers (24 not out) to thank for scraping together their total of 9-142, while Alyssa Healy (26 off 15) threatened to explode.\n\nBut the Thunder's star-studded batting order failed to fire in reply, with 18-year-old debutante Lucy Finn (49 not out off 34 balls) valiant in a losing cause after her side had fallen to 7-49.\n\nThe Thunder finished their 20 overs on 8-118.\n\nIn Saturday's earlier match at Drummoyne Oval, the Hobart Hurricanes posted a 16-run win over the Brisbane Heat via the DLS method.\n\nAAP",

That\u2019s the first thing you need to know when considering where to head for some leisurely Sunday dim sum. The sprawling suburban joints with the powered trolleys? They\u2019re few and far between these days. Instead, if a restaurant is peddling a yum cha menu, it will usually be a tiered-price menu that\u2019s a variation on an a la carte menu, or a banquet menu that presents a number of dishes (perhaps bottomless, within reason) for a set price. Supernormal is serving a special dumplings menu on Sundays. Markus Ravik Southside and Central executive chef Benny Lam remembers yum cha quickly becoming part of his Brisbane childhood after he moved with his family from Hong Kong in 1992. \u201cMy uncle had a Chinese restaurant in Capalaba,\u201d Lam says. \u201cEvery Monday was his day off so he would go to Chinatown [in Fortitude Valley] to buy groceries and have a bit of yum cha.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Perspective Restaurants open in Brisbane until 2am? Why not? \u201cBack then, it was the Chinese chef tradition to go to Chinatown on Mondays because the daytime would be so quiet at their restaurants. So you\u2019d go in, and it had this really good vibe because you would see everyone and talk about this and that.\u201d Lam reckons yum cha isn\u2019t what it used to be for two reasons. First, fresh dim sum is hard. \u201cBecause dumplings are handmade, you need to have a large restaurant and a super high volume to make it sustainable. Even a restaurant like Southside \u2013 if we did just yum cha, we\u2019d 100 per cent have to close in a few months.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was the Chinese chef tradition to go to Chinatown on Mondays \u2026 it had this really good vibe because you would see everyone and talk about this and that.\u201d Southside and Central executive chef Benny Lam. But also, fresh dim sum is popular, and long ago became part of the everyday a la carte menu at upmarket Chinese and pan-Asian restaurants, meaning the need for yum cha-focused restaurants \u2013 or a yum cha service in those restaurants \u2013 fell away. Those that remain are a bit hit or miss. The economies of scale Lam talks about mean a lot of restaurants are ordering their dim sum wholesale, rather than making it fresh themselves. Everyone has an underwhelming yum cha story. The following list is not that. Here\u2019s where to get your yum cha fix in Brisbane. Southside\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouth Brisbane east Asian restaurant Southside recently revised its yum cha menu, which kicks off at noon every Sunday. Southside runs its yum cha menu every Sunday. Markus Ravik It features a la carte menu dishes alongside signature yum cha items, such as goldfish prawn dumplings with tobiko, and panfried pork gyoza with a dan dan sauce and vinegar caramel. The menu is priced at $59 without drinks, or $99 with a two-hour beverage package that throws in house wines, tap beer and signature cocktails. Where to enjoy it? Outside, in the restaurant\u2019s bucolic fern garden beneath the train overpass is best. 63 Melbourne Street, South Brisbane, southside-restaurant.com.au\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRu Yi Dim Sum A bunch of top Brisbane chefs will happily chew your ear off about Ru Yi \u2013 Lam, Stanley\u2019s Louis Tikaram, and The Fifty Six\u2019s Gerald Ong among them. This is closer to the traditional yum cha experience, but with the trolley replaced by an extensive sub-menu of dim sum, tiered in price. Dishes range from a wide variety of dumplings (prawn and chive, prawn and water chestnut, assorted mushroom, to name a few) to pork buns, steamed chicken feet with signature sauce, congee, and rice noodle rolls.

In the years following World War I, Cocteau became associated with a remarkable number of painters, writers and most importantly, musicians. His collaborations with composers such as Stravinsky, Satie, Poulenc and Honegger certainly did yield astonishing results. Le Gateau Chocolat performs in Cocteau\u2019s Circle with the Australian Chamber Orchestra. Credit: Daniel Boud In paying homage to Cocteau\u2019s remarkable legacy, the Australian Chamber Orchestra has chosen to celebrate it in truly contemporary fashion. Set in a smoky, would-be cabaret, Cocteau\u2019s spirit speaks through Le Gateau Chocolat, whose combination of deep bass voice, gender-bending costumes and outr\u00e9 stage presence reinterpret the libertine ambience of interwar Paris for our own times. Richard Tognetti and the ACO enthusiastically lead the audience on a 90-minute musical odyssey through scores associated with Cocteau, interspersed with empathetic connective tissue commissioned from Elena Kats-Chernin.\n\nAustralian-born, German-based soprano Chloe Lankshear adds a classy vocal element, including a nostalgic sung waltz by Poulenc and Lili Boulanger\u2019s plangent Pie Jesu, before finishing with a husky, impassioned account of Edith Piaf\u2019s Hymn to Love. Melbourne pianist Stefan Cassomenos dashes off some pianistic pyrotechnics from Jean Francaix\u2019s Concertino for Piano and Orchestra with customary aplomb. Loading Movements from string quartets by Ravel and Debussy arranged for the orchestra elicit the ACO\u2019s habitual verve, as does Darius Milhaud\u2019s Le boeuf sur le toit, named for the bar where Cocteau\u2019s set used to hang out. Le Gateau Chocolat\u2019s glitteringly camp but heartfelt vocal contributions range from Gershwin to, of all things, Janis Ian\u2019s 1970s hit Stars. While perhaps not astonishing, this thoughtful, colourful tribute to one of last century\u2019s most precocious artistic minds does have an appropriate sense of pushing boundaries, just as the ACO has done over its 50 years of existence.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nSam Fender | People Watching Tour \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nSidney Myer Music Bowl, November 14 The brisk cold of a Melbourne spring evening doesn\u2019t thwart the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm at Sidney Myer Music Bowl. Some in the seated section have already left their allocated spots to surround the front of the stage. When the lights dim, fans roar at Sam Fender and his band\u2019s arrival. Sam Fender performs at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl on November 14. Credit: Paul Rovere The 31-year-old English singer-songwriter from North Shields has sold out arenas across the UK, Ireland, Europe and North America. He recently won the Mercury Prize for his 2025 album People Watching \u2013 awarded to musicians from the UK and Ireland for best album \u2013 and donated the winnings to the Music Venues Trust, a charity that preserves small live performance venues. Fender is accompanied by a seven-piece band filled with multi-instrumentalists, including drums, guitar, keys, back-up vocals, tambourine, saxophone and trumpet. When they all perform together, the sound inside the bowl is so electric you can feel the pulsating rhythm in your body; getting lost in the music, you forget where you are.\n\nDespite confessing that he\u2019s suffering from jet lag, Fender\u2019s performance never falters. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s do this, lads,\u201d he says as he launches into Will We Talk? His repertoire is a mix of slower tracks and American-style 1970s rock ballads. Talk to You, a collaboration featuring Elton John on piano on the original track, is sung with an air of regret about the end of a long-term friendship. Spit of You seeps with a pleading tone as he sings about the fraught communication between a father and son; a Polaroid appears of him and his father on screen. Fender\u2019s Melbourne performance never faltered. Credit: Paul Rovere Contrastingly, the album\u2019s title track People Watching feels anthemic and Crumbling Empire is reminiscent of the Killers\u2019 heartland rock era, with visuals of mountain ranges, desert landscapes and industrial plants playing into the working-class sensibility. Howdon Aldi Death Queue is a fun punk rock interlude, which Fender jokingly describes as \u201cthe stupidest song I ever wrote\u201d. Seventeen Going Under is a highlight. Fender demands that the crowd sings along, and they abide enthusiastically. The keyboard player stands on his seat and amps up fans as the drums pound and trumpet and saxophone soar. Fender makes fun of the pretence of leaving the stage before an encore, and the crowd continues the vocal riff to coax him back. \u201cMelbourne, thank you so much for a wonderful f---ing night,\u201d Fender shouts. With a bang, white confetti fills the air, followed by deafening guitar and cheers.\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nGuewel \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nArts House, until November 16 A guewel is a West African oral historian, someone who carries in memory the stories of local families, who can summon the lore of a place and its people as a celebratory recitation. Guewel at Arts House. Credit: Gregory Lorenzutti In this hour-long production led by Lamine Sonko, the figure of the guewel is reimagined as a conduit between earthly rhythms and the life of the stars: the custodian of a larger lore. The show sketches the outlines of a cosmology, while also showcasing a cohort of gifted performers \u2013 dancers, musicians, ritualists \u2013 in front of lushly animated projections.\n\nAt its centre are three figures personifying the sun, the moon and the stars. Their full-body costumes \u2013 gorgeously sculptural \u2013 recall masquerades from Senegal\u2019s Casamance region, with their all-enveloping silhouettes. The dried fronds and towering crest of the figure representing the stars suggest a Kumpo-like apparition, while the moon reads as a delicate crescent, with cowrie shells gleaming on dark cloth. The voltage that runs through Guewel comes from the drumming and dancing. Credit: Gregory Lorenzutti The costumes are impressive, but the voltage that runs through Guewel comes from the drumming and dancing. Hand-drum flurries launch sudden accelerations; legs carve lateral pathways as the dancers kick up their heels. The animations are often beautiful, with veils and translucencies, but at times the smoky effects pull focus from bodies onstage. The visual busyness dilutes the intimacy.\n\nStill, it\u2019s the projections that spell out the work\u2019s big ideas: everything is interwoven, nature moves in cycles. The cosmology is legible, even when dramaturgical transitions feel more ceremonial than exploratory. The figure representing the stars in Guewel, who harks back to West African masquerades. Credit: Gregory Lorenzutti What does it mean to really inhabit ancestral knowledge, not just cite it? Brief as it is, Guewel cannot offer a full answer. It plays more like a prelude that clears space for a deeper encounter. Seven years in gestation and framed as a cross-cultural collaboration, Guewel feels like the opening scene of a larger narrative \u2013 and makes you curious for the epic adventure to follow.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann\n\nTHEATRE\n\nThe Haunting of Spook Mansion (By Ghosts) \u2605\u2605\n\nChapel Off Chapel, until November 23 This paranormal piss-take from comedy writer Michael Ward (Shaun Micallef\u2019s Mad as Hell, RockWiz, I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here) sports well-known comedic talent. It\u2019s flagrantly inane and does scrape the bottom of the proverbial, humour-wise, though it does also barrel along. Ghost-busting super-sceptic professor Adrian Chambers (Peter Houghton) has made a career debunking the supernatural. At a sparsely attended launch for his latest book, he\u2019s buttonholed by hot librarian Beth Jackson (Emily Taheny) during the post-launch Q&A. Peter Houghton in The Haunting of Spook Mansion (By Ghosts). Credit: Darren Gill Yet the bookish Beth is no ordinary fan. She has a fiendish proposition for Chambers: $500,000 to spend the night in Spook Mansion, a notorious haunted house. Chambers nearly declines \u2013 crackpot offers are common in the paranormal investigation biz \u2013 but he needs the cash.\n\nSo begins a ridiculous comedy horror haunted by every trope in the book, including an elderly potato-seller with a terrible provincial accent (Ben Russell) to warn the stranger off. Spook Mansion goes all in for cheesy visual tricks: bookcases, sinister portraits, a fireplace with strange objects on the mantel. Beth will summon poltergeists and apparitions in a seance; the source of the clangour in the basement will be discovered. Houghton and Emily Taheny lean into myriad horror tropes. Credit: Darren Gill Why has Chambers been lured to this place? All will come to light, as murderous secrets are revealed and a diabolical plot unmasked. Some of the buffoonery relies on pop culture references aimed at Boomer and Gen X audiences, but there are enough shameless hijinks on offer, under Russell Fletcher\u2019s direction, to get a giggle and a snort from anyone. As a mainstream lampoon of supernatural horror, The Haunting of Spook Mansion (By Ghosts) does the job, but it could be significantly improved. Plot points swarm the denouement like flying monkeys, in a way that makes final revelations difficult to follow. And the show sometimes feels like a TV comedy skit that got out of hand.",

        "text": "5. Tom Hooper - 6.5 One of the Wallabies best on a night of underwhelming performances. Topped both the Wallabies\u2019 carry and tackle counts. Was likened to Ireland\u2019s impressive middle-rower Tadgh Beirne in the pre-game call, and while he\u2019s not there yet, that\u2019s a realistic ambition for the youngster, who is still only 24 and is arguably the Wallabies\u2019 find (or re-discovery) of 2025. 6. Rob Valetini - 5.5 Took some big carries early in the first half and used his power in the contact zone. But fell out of the game in the second half. We haven\u2019t seen the same game-changing talents from big Bobby V in the last few months.\n\n7. Fraser McReight - 6 Pushed hard, and is always one of the Wallabies players searching to turn the game. Scored a well-taken try. But he was well negated by the Ireland forwards, and wasn\u2019t rewarded by the referee for his 50-50 poaching opportunities. 8. Harry Wilson - 5 Another whose effort is never in question. Puts his hand up for carries and hard tackles whenever they\u2019re needed. But the impact of those involvements ebbs and flows, and there is a question on Wilson\u2019s dwindling battery level, too. No one will enjoy a post-tour break more.\n\n9. Jake Gordon - 5 Kicking game was arguably a fraction off this week, with chasers rarely getting up for a contest. Gordon\u2019s work when recycling on attack in Ireland\u2019s red zone was sharp, but the problem was the Wallabies didn\u2019t get to it more often. 10. James O\u2019Connor - 4 Tough night for James O\u2019Connor, who was thrown headfirst into the mincer by Joe Schmidt in Dublin. Not even in the squad for the tour until this week, he was called in and then immediately given a starting jersey. And then tasked with running an unwise attacking game plan. James O\u2019Connor of Australia is tackled by Sam Prendergast. Credit: Getty Images\n\nNone of that excuses O\u2019Connor\u2019s skill errors. His rustiness was apparent. He was beaten in the air, too. But this was just another episode of the blindfolded darts game that is the Wallabies selection policy for the No.10. And it\u2019s left us no closer to getting answers. 11. Harry Potter - 4 As said every week about Potter: a mixed game. But this time the good - some impressive defence - was outweighed by poor work under the high ball, both defensively and offensively, and being caught out of position. Schmidt rates Potter as strong in the air, but it hasn\u2019t been apparent in recent outings. 12. Len Ikitau -5.5 Another who shone when the Wallabies had the ball in the Irish red zone, and were attacking directly. Ikitau plays as an extra back-rower in that zone, and also handles as a first receiver. A try was a good reward. But otherwise was passing out the back, and Ireland always had the answers.\n\n13. Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii - 5.5 Filipo Daugunu of Australia jumps for the ball with Mack Hansen. Credit: Getty Images Looked for ways to enter the game on attack and defended intelligently. And was even one of the few Wallabies to take a clean catch under a high ball. Are we wedded to Suaalii at No.13? Hands up if you think he should be the Wallabies\u2019 fullback against France. 14. Filipo Daugunu - 4 A big powerful ball runner, but had little opportunity other than one nice run, that was ruined by a loose inside pass. His high ball work was also not where it needs to be.\n\n15. Max Jorgensen - 3.5 Park this one and move on. Not a night to remember for the young superstar, with errors aplenty, many of which led to Irish tries. High balls were dropped, there were knock-ons, and the usually unshakeable confidence of Jorgensen was clearly shaken. Kudos to Schmidt, perhaps, for backing him, but Jorgensen should have moved to the wing when Kellaway came on. Reserves 16. Billy Pollard - 5 Powerful running on display, and his try was a good reward. But losing the lineout in the 64th minute was a bad miss, and while the lift and jump were off, this has to be bread-and-butter stuff at Test level.\n\n17. Tom Robertson - 4.5 Loading No major impact from Robertson, who keeps a scrum locked down and does his tight duties well. But he doesn\u2019t threaten as a ball carrier. 18. Zane Nonggorr - 3.5 Penalised for collapsing his first scrum and then slow on lift on Frost for that crucial missed lineout.\n\n19. Nick Frost - 3.5 Worked hard in a short time on the field, with eight tackles in 16 minutes. But then missed the key lineout and was binned for the last 10 minutes, which allowed Ireland to exploit his absence. 20. Carlo Tizzano - 4.5 Played a quarter but didn\u2019t get sighted with any big plays. Like McReight, he couldn\u2019t get on the ball. Question mark whether a second No.7 is a good use of the reserve back row slot, given McReight is an 80-minute player. 21. Ryan Lonergan - n/a",

It follows the same action taken by the Nationals earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Sussan Ley says the party agreed its policy platform would be about energy affordability as an issue - and that could be achieved without the 2050 emissions reduction target.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe said the party platform would be for Australia to stay with the Paris Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiberal Senator Jonathon Duniam told Sky News, the national interest would govern decisions made on emission reduction plans, called Nationally Determined Contributions, under the Paris Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I think when you read Article 4 of the Paris Agreement in totality, there is provision for us to do what is in the national interest. And we would determine those contributions and the emission reductions effort in line with national interest. That means making energy more affordable. We have been doing ourselves a disservice. Climate change is settled - don't worry about that. It's not the debate here. It's about how you deal with the efforts our country puts in when it comes to emissions reduction.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bureau of Meteorology says the risk of severe thunderstorms remains active over the next 24 hours for parts of eastern Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHailstones, heavy rain and destructive winds have hit parts of New South Wales and Queensland on Saturday.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoutheast Queensland received more than 50 millimetres of rain recorded in 30 minutes - at multiple locations west of Brisbane.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd almost 3,000 properties were without power in southeast Queensland at 9pm on Saturday, according to Energex.\n\n\n\n\n\nAngus Hines, from the Bureau of Meteorology, says the storm danger continues for eastern Australia before the focus shifts from Monday to parts of the country's north and west.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Where these storms do develop, they could bring some pretty significant weather impacts with them. Damage to cars and property, particularly from the large and giant hail is absolutely possible. And we've seen that happen many times in the last few weeks. We could also see power outages, travel and transport delays as well as flash flooding.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands have marched in the Brazilian city of Belem to call for climate justice and land rights at COP30.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe demonstration brought together Indigenous communities, Brazilian youth groups, and activists from around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nIndigenous activists have been protesting outside the COP venue, saying many have been excluded access to the proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazil's Minister of Indigenous Peoples, Sonia Guajajara, says 400 places out of 1,200 in Brazil's delegation were granted to Indigenous representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\nCristiane Puyanawa says she wants to be heard on the issue of Indigenous land rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We are here today at the global climate march. Women, youths, Indigenous peoples, and river communities are united to demand social justice and the demarcation of Indigenous lands. Our land and our forest are not commodities. Respect nature and the peoples who live in the forest.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralian actor Cate Blanchett says the pope's message on the vital role of cinema, actors and filmmakers is affirming and inspiring.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen stars Blanchett, Monica Bellucci, Chris Pine and Viggo Mortensen were among those invited to the private Vatican audience with the Pope to mark the 130th anniversary of cinema this year.\n\n\n\n\n\nPope Leo told the group that the logic of algorithms tends to repeat what works, but art opens up what is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd he urged those involved in cinema to have the courage to keep tackling difficult subject matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"In the present era, there is a need for witnesses of hope, beauty and truth. Good cinema and those who create and star in it have the power to recover the authenticity of imagery in order to safeguard and promote human dignity. Do not be afraid to confront the world\u2019s wounds. Violence, poverty, exile, loneliness, addiction and forgotten wars are issues that need to be acknowledged and narrated. Good cinema does not exploit pain; it recognises and explores it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Tennis, Alex de Minaur says he is already looking to come back even stronger after losing to Jannik Sinner 7-5 6-2 in the semis at the ATP Finals in Turin.\n\n\n\n\n\nSinner had to overcome first-set resistance from de Minaur until forging away in breathtaking fashion to set up a final against either world No.1 Carlos Alcaraz or Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime.\n\n\n\n\n\nDe Minaur says he sees no other way, but to move forward.\n\n\n\n",

But that is not how the system works. It is not a ballot process in that sense. That means we need to reach an agreement with T\u00fcrkiye. That's difficult. I do know it is in Australia's best interest to be COP President and to host COP. I will continue to have conversations with my Turkish counterparts - in consultation with the Pacific over the week or so.

Especially this season we played always in different situations on the court. On different types of courts. And tennis really can change a lot from one day to the other.

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT:\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Stuart runs a paint business on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches and when it comes to cutting electricity costs, he\u2019s ahead of the curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our factory here in Brookvale is powered 100 per cent with solar energy. Before we went solar, we were spending $24,000 a year on electricity. All that was being wasted. We took the plunge, we went solar, we got a bank loan to do it. That bank loan is now paid off. Our power bills are now negative.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs managing director of Colormaker Industries, Mr Stuart has combined sustainability and innovation to beat rising prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Electricity is an inescapable cost for most small businesses. We're an Australian manufacturer, trying to be competitive on a world stage. As power prices rise, that takes money out of the bottom line.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Stuart\u2019s paint factory now runs entirely on renewable energy, powered by a 100-kilowatt rooftop array backed by a custom-built battery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our big battery is Australian designed and built. It can take the surplus solar that we produce during the course of the day, store it overnight, then we can run all of our morning production with it. Had you told me six years ago we'd be where we are now, I would never have believed you.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Australians are buying big batteries as upfront prices fall, by around 20 per cent last year alone, according to the Climate Council\u2019s Greg Bourne.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Initially the cost of batteries was too high and the payback period didn't really work, but that crossover point has really occurred right now and there's many more batteries available, whether it be at the residential level or at the small business level.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAs power prices soar, up by 9 per cent last quarter according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Mr Bourne urges more people to get on board with battery storage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have 4 million homes already with solar panels, but it's a much smaller percentage have got batteries. I would want it to double and double and double again.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nElectricity prices are driving up Australia\u2019s inflation figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of living (CPI) rose by 3.2 per cent in the year to September.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to a new report from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, these rising costs are hurting Australia\u2019s 2.5 million small business owners.\n\n\n\n\n\nCEO Andrew McKellar explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Energy is certainly one of the top costs that small businesses cite. So, it is very clear that rising energy bills over recent years have taken a toll, we know that across NSW, Victoria and QLD for many businesses those costs have gone up 200 per cent in the past three years or so and it\u2019s a significant cost pressure that many small businesses are facing!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor its Small Business Conditions Survey, the Chamber of Commerce spoke with 1,100 small business owners across the nation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than one quarter, 28 per cent, had considered closing in the past year and 30 per cent worried they may close within the next 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\nCost pressures are a concern for the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia (COSBOA).\n\n\n\n\n\nChair Matthew Addison says many owner operators surveyed for the Small Business Perspectives reported they use personal savings to stay afloat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Really tough business environment we're in at the moment and what this report brought out was 64 per cent said they recorded lower profits this year than they did the year before. Sixty per cent reported as business owners, they couldn't pay themselves every payday.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite rising costs, including power prices, Mr Addison says going solar is not for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Bill comparison is always a wise technique. If a business is in a situation, they can look at putting solar panels in or put a battery in. But in the two and a half million small businesses in Australia, one and a half million of those are sole traders, that's the individual themselves. They don't necessarily have the time or capacity or the financial capacity to invest in what might be the solar panels or the battery.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut with profits under pressure, Mr Stuart says making small changes can make a big difference to the bottom line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We bought in an energy efficiency engineer, he did an audit of the entire site and found that 26 per cent of our electricity was being used to make compressed air and a third of that was being wasted. So, we bought a new compressor and over the 12 months after that was introduced, we saw a 23 per cent drop in entire energy usage. We also bought an electric forklift. So that means we've got no more LPG on site. W e changed our lighting to LEDs. That's something that any company can do, at surprisingly little cost. And we also bought a mega shredder. So, a lot of the cardboard that we had previously sent out to be recycled we can now use on site and give it a second life. Since we introduced solar and the other enhancements, we're now saving somewhere between $35,000 and $50,000 a year every year. That's baked in!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness failure rates are forecast to stay above 5 per cent for the next year, and Mr Stuart has this advice for those struggling.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The US Justice Department said it will carry out President Donald Trump's request to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's alleged ties with former Democratic president Bill Clinton, as Trump sought to shift the focus from his own relationship with the convicted sex offender.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe move comes two days after a congressional committee released thousands of documents that raised new questions about Trump's relationship with the late financier, and marks the latest in a series of demands by Trump for federal law enforcement to pursue his perceived political enemies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAttorney-general Pam Bondi on Friday said Jay Clayton, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, will take the lead on the investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Epstein scandal has been a political thorn in Trump's side for months, partly because he amplified conspiracy theories about Epstein to his own supporters.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany Trump voters believe Bondi and other Trump officials have covered up Epstein's ties to powerful figures and obscured details surrounding his death by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019.\n\n\n\nAlong with Clinton, who socialised with Epstein in the early 2000s, Trump said he had asked the Justice Department to investigate former treasury secretary Larry Summers, and Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder who is also a prominent Democratic donor.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three men were mentioned in the 20,000 Epstein-related documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem!\" Trump wrote on social media. \"They all know about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJPMorgan, which is also under investigation, said in a statement it regrets its past association with Epstein, who was a client between 1998 and 2013, and did not help him commit \"heinous acts\".\n\n\n\nJeffrey Epstein (left) and Donald Trump at Trump's Florida estate in 1997. Source: Getty / Davidoff Studios Photography JPMorgan paid $290 million in 2023 to some of Epstein's victims to settle accusations that it had turned a blind eye to his sex trafficking. The bank did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton's deputy chief of staff, Angel Urena, said on X: \"These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing. The rest is noise meant to distract from election losses, backfiring shutdowns, and who knows what else.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a post on X, Hoffman called on Trump to release all of the Epstein files, saying his only engagement with Epstein was to raise funds for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I want this complete release because it will show that the calls for baseless investigations of me are nothing more than political persecution and slander,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\nTrump faces continued pressure over Epstein\n\nTrump and Epstein were friends during the 1990s and the 2000s, but Trump says he broke off ties before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump has consistently denied knowing about the late financier's abuse and sex trafficking of underage girls.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO White House dismisses emails that raise new questions about Trump ties to Epstein SBS News 05:24 English\n\nStill, some of Trump's most ardent supporters have accused his administration of a cover-up. Trump, who frequently engages with reporters, has declined to take questions over the last several days as new revelations about Epstein have become public.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Republican-controlled House of Representatives is expected to vote next week on legislation that would force the Justice Department to release all of the material it holds on Epstein, who was facing federal charges of sex trafficking minors at the time of his suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe measure is expected to pass, even after house speaker Mike Johnson repeatedly manoeuvred to try to block the vote. It would also require the Senate to pass similar legislation and Trump's approval to compel the Justice Department to act.\n\n\n\n\n\nJust four in 10 Republicans in an October Reuters poll said they approved of Trump's handling of the Epstein files, well below the nine in 10 who approve of his overall performance in the White House.\n\n\n\nNo credible evidence has surfaced that Clinton, Summers or Hoffman were involved in Epstein's sex trafficking. All have previously denied wrongdoing and have expressed regret about their relationships with him.\n\n\n\n\n\nClinton flew on Epstein's private jet several times before the financier's 2008 conviction, while Summers accepted philanthropic gifts from Epstein while serving as president of Harvard University. Hoffman has acknowledged meeting with Epstein multiple times in professional situations.\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore his 2008 conviction, Epstein worked and socialised with a long list of well-known figures, including the UK's former Prince Andrew, who was stripped of his royal title due in part to his association with Epstein.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "It's pretty controversial to hate your children. It's even more controversial to leave your dying child in a hotel room to go smoke and flirt with a stranger.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that's the type of motherhood at the heart of indie production house A24's new film, If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.\n\n\n\n\n\nStarring Australian actor Rose Byrne and written and directed by American filmmaker Mary Bronstein, If I Had Legs I'd Kick You follows therapist Linda (played by Byrne) \u2014 one of the unapologetically difficult mothers you'll see on screen.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith her sick daughter requiring round-the-clock care, Linda's life begins to unravel in spectacular fashion. She becomes obsessed with a mysterious hole in her ceiling \u2014 a symbol of her waning mental state, poor decision-making and inner turmoil.\n\n\n\n\n\nForced into a tiny motel room with her dying child, Linda sneaks out at night to eat Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, drink wine and engage in a flirtationship with the motel worker downstairs (a surprising A$AP Rocky) despite having a husband. She ditches her daughter's therapy sessions, zones out and offers bad advice to her own clients, confessing her darkest thoughts to her therapist and colleague (Conan O'Brien).\n\n\n\n\n\nShe's stressed. Sleepless. Hungry. An alcoholic. Trying to hold it all together \u2014 and failing.\n\n\n\nWith a surprising cast featuring the likes of Rose Byrne, rapper A$AP Rocky and talk-show host Conan O'Brien, If I Had Legs I'd Kick You might seem like a quirky affair. But there's a deeper side to it. Source: Supplied The casting might seem intentionally surprising, but the film is less about shock value than it is a meditation on the unspeakable parts of motherhood that rarely make it to the screen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What I wanted to do expressly was create a portrait of a mother that I had never seen before,\" Bronstein tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When I thought about it, I was like: what movie have I ever seen where it centres a woman who happens to have a child, but it's not about her mothering and it doesn't judge her and it lets her be an actual human being? That's written and made by a woman?\"\n\n\n\nWriter and director Mary Bronstein doesn't want audiences to escape from the spiral of anxiety and existential dread that comes with her new film, If I Had Legs I'd Kick You. Source: Getty / Mondadori Portfolio Bronstein says she made the film for a very particular audience: mothers who may not recognise themselves in glossy or idealised portrayals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The more specific you get with something, the more people can actually relate to it. The movie is about something that's very specific: a mother who's in a very specific situation that most mothers are not going to be in.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film is partially inspired by Bronstein's own experience caring for her seven-year-old daughter in a tiny San Diego motel room, surrounded by takeaway containers and existential dread \u2014 while navigating what she calls a \"confused combination of reverence and complete disrespect\" for motherhood.\n\n\n\n'You're stuck with her'\n\nAcross 113 minutes, If I Had Legs I'd Kick You drags its audience into a steady, uncomfortable spiral.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe watch Byrne's Linda eat with animalistic intensity \u2014 mouth open, food falling out \u2014 a visual shorthand for a woman who can't take care of herself. She drinks two bottles of wine a night while her daughter, meant to be under constant surveillance, sleeps alone. She buys a hamster and watches it escape and get run over by a car, guts spurting before the camera cuts abruptly to a slice of lasagna.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen there's the hole: a growing, pulsing void in the ceiling that serves as the film's trigger point. Even Bronstein isn't sure if the hole is real or not, explaining it as a symbol of that place in your brain where you shove everything that you can't deal with \u2014 knowing full well that it will force its way out eventually.\n\n\n\nIn If I Had Legs I'd Kick You, Rose Byrne is going through an \"existential crisis of tremendous proportions\". Source: Supplied / A24 \"This woman is having an existential crisis of tremendous proportions. She's experienced a trauma that she's avoiding at all costs. She's running away from it for the entire movie and it's going to come and get her,\" Bronstein says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It starts out as the first problem in the film and then expands out into this thing that takes on meaning beyond anything that reality can answer. I can't even really tell you [what it is] because it's a completely expressive idea that I can't fully articulate in words.\"\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Anya says having a child was the 'stupidest' decision she ever made\n\nByrne's performance is repulsive, unkempt, unpleasant \u2014 and terrifyingly real.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She's in a state where she cannot take care of herself in any way, shape or form. We don't even know if she's bathing,\" Bronstein says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"She has a de-evolution of appearance in this film. As her emotional state goes down, so does her appearance. She can't pretend anymore on the outside, it's gone.\"\n\n\n\nIf you are seeing an actual child, your sympathy is immediately going to go with that child.\n\nHer child, meanwhile, is a faceless voice that exists only off-screen and whose presence is felt through Byrne's reactions. The camera stays close to Bryne, lingering on the small, irritated microexpressions that have already generated Oscar's buzz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"As soon as you're dealing with some of the behaviours that Linda is doing, if you are seeing an actual child, your sympathy is immediately going to go with that child. That's how we're wired,\" Bronstein says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What I wanted to do is make it impossible \u2014 impossible for there to be an easy way for the viewer to put their sympathy elsewhere than her. You're stuck with her. It's about her.\"\n\n\n\n'There's a deep shame'\n\nWhen it comes to motherhood on screen, the depictions we get are often narrow. In films like Bad Moms, the 'bad mother' is softened with humour \u2014 she might smoke too much or go out clubbing on a Wednesday, but she still loves her kids. She doesn't hate them. She doesn't regret becoming a mother.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat sanitation leaves little space for women who do struggle \u2014 those who experience perinatal depression, anxiety, or even regret having children entirely.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to one in five women experience perinatal depression or anxiety during pregnancy or following the birth of their baby, according to Perinatal Anxiety & Depression Australia (PANDA). Postnatal psychosis \u2014 rarer but more severe \u2014 affects one to two new mothers per 1,000 births. Women may also experience PTSD, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia after giving birth.\n\n\n\nWriter and director Mary Bronstein isn't interested in 'bad' mothers. Instead, she hopes her film will break apart overly sentimental depictions of motherhood. Source: Supplied / A24 Julie Borninkhof, a clinical psychologist and the CEO of PANDA, says perinatal depression and anxiety often look different for everyone \u2014 sometimes like wanting to \"climb into a dark little box and block yourself away\", or being \"wound up like a rubber band\" with anxiety.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Baby blues is an experience that's really common to women \u2026 but it's more short-winded and usually only lasts for a few weeks following the birth of a baby. Whereas anxiety and depression can go on for months and beyond the 12-month period,\" Borninkhof tells SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nBronstein tackles that taboo directly.\n\n\n\nOne subplot follows Linda's client Caroline (Australian Danielle Macdonald), a new mother who abandons her baby mid therapy session. Earlier, she emailed Linda a video of Andrea Yates \u2014 the real-life Texas mother who drowned her five children in 2001 after developing postpartum psychosis \u2014 fearing she might follow the same path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That storyline was very inspired by a lot of real cases that have happened in the [United] States. Every once in a while on the news, it's like: 'This mother did this. She did that'. She's villainised.\" Bronstein says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes it is bad people doing bad things. But most often, it's a mental illness. It's a real thing. It's postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis.\"\n\n\n\nWe're sold a bill of goods ... but it's not like that for a lot of women.\n\nBronstein wanted to challenge the overly sentimental depictions of motherhood we're sold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We're sold a bill of goods \u2014 the baby comes out, they give it to the mother, and you immediately look at and bond with the baby. But it's not like that for a lot of women.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBorninkhof agrees that varied portrayals can help dismantle shame and stigma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People still find it difficult to say that they're struggling and that they need help \u2026 this pervasive feeling of being a failure and that you're not able to do what so many others are able to do is still a real barrier to people seeking help.\"\n\n\n\n'Maybe I got rid of the wrong one'\n\nThe film's most polarising moment comes when Linda, reflecting on a previous abortion, wonders aloud to her therapist: \"Maybe I got rid of the wrong one\".\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a punch to the gut \u2014 and exactly the point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I wrote it in the script. I took it out. I put it back in because I knew that was the line that was going to make people uncomfortable,\" Bronstein says. \"But I was like, no \u2014 that's why it needs to be in there.\"\n\n\n\nI wrote it in the script. I took it out. I put it back in because I knew that was the line that was going to make people uncomfortable.\n\n\"It's the only time in the movie where she's truly being honest and expressing something really real and she's fuc---g kicked in the face for it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRegret over parenthood isn't rare. While difficult to quantify, one 2023 study estimated that between 5 and 14 per cent of parents in developed countries regret having children and would choose childlessness if they could turn back time.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnline, communities like Reddit's r/regretfulparents (54,000 members) and the Facebook group 'I Regret Having Children' (88,000 followers) share anonymous confessions \u2014 a testament to the lingering taboo.\n\n\n\nThe film's most controversial line almost didn't make it to the final cut, with Bronstein worried it would make people \"uncomfortable\". Source: SBS News / A24 Borninkhof says such regret is \"normal\" and \"human\", but can become damaging if left unaddressed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For people who do experience regret about being a parent and then sit in that space, it's hard to parent through that feeling,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We need to get help with the internal conflict that comes with that as soon as possible.\"\n\n\n\n'There's nothing wrong with being uncomfortable'\n\nBorninkhof urges viewers with lived experience of perinatal mental illness to approach films like this with care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For some people who feel like they've gotten through and survived that experience and have learned and grown from it, they may feel a sense of empathy and distance from being able to see a movie like this,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Some people feel this great sense of empowerment and self-reflection because they see that their experience was real and valid.\"\n\n\n\nWhile one clinical psychologist warns a film like this could be confronting for those who have experienced perinatal mental illness, Bronstein says there's \"nothing wrong with being uncomfortable\". Source: Supplied / A24 But she says for those who might be in the \"thick of it\", it might be confronting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"That's not because the portrayal is not correct or shouldn't be told, but simply because our ability to hold all of our emotions at once and see them portrayed on a screen or reflected back to us in somebody's words can be really confronting.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBronstein says discomfort is part of the point.\n\n\n\nIf something makes you uncomfortable, you need to wonder why it makes you so uncomfortable.\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with being uncomfortable. If something makes you uncomfortable, you need to wonder why it makes you so uncomfortable,\" she says.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Why can't a woman wonder that in the privacy of her therapist's office? Why can't she say that? She's not saying it to her child. She's not even saying it to her husband.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's none of my business if somebody likes the movie or doesn't like the movie \u2026 I made a movie that really is dealing with some very uncomfortable things.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But if the reason you don't like it is because something made you uncomfortable, that interests me. Why would that be a reason to not like a movie?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PANDA National Helpline is available 9am-7.30pm Monday to Friday on 1300 726 306.

That\u2019s the first thing you need to know when considering where to head for some leisurely Sunday dim sum. The sprawling suburban joints with the powered trolleys? They\u2019re few and far between these days. Instead, if a restaurant is peddling a yum cha menu, it will usually be a tiered-price menu that\u2019s a variation on an a la carte menu, or a banquet menu that presents a number of dishes (perhaps bottomless, within reason) for a set price. Supernormal is serving a special dumplings menu on Sundays. Markus Ravik Southside and Central executive chef Benny Lam remembers yum cha quickly becoming part of his Brisbane childhood after he moved with his family from Hong Kong in 1992. \u201cMy uncle had a Chinese restaurant in Capalaba,\u201d Lam says. \u201cEvery Monday was his day off so he would go to Chinatown [in Fortitude Valley] to buy groceries and have a bit of yum cha.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Article Perspective Restaurants open in Brisbane until 2am? Why not? \u201cBack then, it was the Chinese chef tradition to go to Chinatown on Mondays because the daytime would be so quiet at their restaurants. So you\u2019d go in, and it had this really good vibe because you would see everyone and talk about this and that.\u201d Lam reckons yum cha isn\u2019t what it used to be for two reasons. First, fresh dim sum is hard. \u201cBecause dumplings are handmade, you need to have a large restaurant and a super high volume to make it sustainable. Even a restaurant like Southside \u2013 if we did just yum cha, we\u2019d 100 per cent have to close in a few months.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was the Chinese chef tradition to go to Chinatown on Mondays \u2026 it had this really good vibe because you would see everyone and talk about this and that.\u201d Southside and Central executive chef Benny Lam. But also, fresh dim sum is popular, and long ago became part of the everyday a la carte menu at upmarket Chinese and pan-Asian restaurants, meaning the need for yum cha-focused restaurants \u2013 or a yum cha service in those restaurants \u2013 fell away. Those that remain are a bit hit or miss. The economies of scale Lam talks about mean a lot of restaurants are ordering their dim sum wholesale, rather than making it fresh themselves. Everyone has an underwhelming yum cha story. The following list is not that. Here\u2019s where to get your yum cha fix in Brisbane.

In the years following World War I, Cocteau became associated with a remarkable number of painters, writers and most importantly, musicians. His collaborations with composers such as Stravinsky, Satie, Poulenc and Honegger certainly did yield astonishing results. Le Gateau Chocolat performs in Cocteau\u2019s Circle with the Australian Chamber Orchestra. Credit: Daniel Boud In paying homage to Cocteau\u2019s remarkable legacy, the Australian Chamber Orchestra has chosen to celebrate it in truly contemporary fashion. Set in a smoky, would-be cabaret, Cocteau\u2019s spirit speaks through Le Gateau Chocolat, whose combination of deep bass voice, gender-bending costumes and outr\u00e9 stage presence reinterpret the libertine ambience of interwar Paris for our own times. Richard Tognetti and the ACO enthusiastically lead the audience on a 90-minute musical odyssey through scores associated with Cocteau, interspersed with empathetic connective tissue commissioned from Elena Kats-Chernin.\n\nAustralian-born, German-based soprano Chloe Lankshear adds a classy vocal element, including a nostalgic sung waltz by Poulenc and Lili Boulanger\u2019s plangent Pie Jesu, before finishing with a husky, impassioned account of Edith Piaf\u2019s Hymn to Love. Melbourne pianist Stefan Cassomenos dashes off some pianistic pyrotechnics from Jean Francaix\u2019s Concertino for Piano and Orchestra with customary aplomb. Loading Movements from string quartets by Ravel and Debussy arranged for the orchestra elicit the ACO\u2019s habitual verve, as does Darius Milhaud\u2019s Le boeuf sur le toit, named for the bar where Cocteau\u2019s set used to hang out. Le Gateau Chocolat\u2019s glitteringly camp but heartfelt vocal contributions range from Gershwin to, of all things, Janis Ian\u2019s 1970s hit Stars. While perhaps not astonishing, this thoughtful, colourful tribute to one of last century\u2019s most precocious artistic minds does have an appropriate sense of pushing boundaries, just as the ACO has done over its 50 years of existence.\n\nReviewed by Tony Way\n\nMUSIC\n\nSam Fender | People Watching Tour \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nSidney Myer Music Bowl, November 14 The brisk cold of a Melbourne spring evening doesn\u2019t thwart the crowd\u2019s enthusiasm at Sidney Myer Music Bowl. Some in the seated section have already left their allocated spots to surround the front of the stage. When the lights dim, fans roar at Sam Fender and his band\u2019s arrival. Sam Fender performs at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl on November 14. Credit: Paul Rovere The 31-year-old English singer-songwriter from North Shields has sold out arenas across the UK, Ireland, Europe and North America. He recently won the Mercury Prize for his 2025 album People Watching \u2013 awarded to musicians from the UK and Ireland for best album \u2013 and donated the winnings to the Music Venues Trust, a charity that preserves small live performance venues. Fender is accompanied by a seven-piece band filled with multi-instrumentalists, including drums, guitar, keys, back-up vocals, tambourine, saxophone and trumpet. When they all perform together, the sound inside the bowl is so electric you can feel the pulsating rhythm in your body; getting lost in the music, you forget where you are.\n\nDespite confessing that he\u2019s suffering from jet lag, Fender\u2019s performance never falters. \u201cAll right, let\u2019s do this, lads,\u201d he says as he launches into Will We Talk? His repertoire is a mix of slower tracks and American-style 1970s rock ballads. Talk to You, a collaboration featuring Elton John on piano on the original track, is sung with an air of regret about the end of a long-term friendship. Spit of You seeps with a pleading tone as he sings about the fraught communication between a father and son; a Polaroid appears of him and his father on screen. Fender\u2019s Melbourne performance never faltered. Credit: Paul Rovere Contrastingly, the album\u2019s title track People Watching feels anthemic and Crumbling Empire is reminiscent of the Killers\u2019 heartland rock era, with visuals of mountain ranges, desert landscapes and industrial plants playing into the working-class sensibility. Howdon Aldi Death Queue is a fun punk rock interlude, which Fender jokingly describes as \u201cthe stupidest song I ever wrote\u201d. Seventeen Going Under is a highlight. Fender demands that the crowd sings along, and they abide enthusiastically. The keyboard player stands on his seat and amps up fans as the drums pound and trumpet and saxophone soar. Fender makes fun of the pretence of leaving the stage before an encore, and the crowd continues the vocal riff to coax him back. \u201cMelbourne, thank you so much for a wonderful f---ing night,\u201d Fender shouts. With a bang, white confetti fills the air, followed by deafening guitar and cheers.\n\nReviewed by Vyshnavee Wijekumar\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nGuewel \u2605\u2605\u2605\n\nArts House, until November 16 A guewel is a West African oral historian, someone who carries in memory the stories of local families, who can summon the lore of a place and its people as a celebratory recitation. Guewel at Arts House. Credit: Gregory Lorenzutti In this hour-long production led by Lamine Sonko, the figure of the guewel is reimagined as a conduit between earthly rhythms and the life of the stars: the custodian of a larger lore. The show sketches the outlines of a cosmology, while also showcasing a cohort of gifted performers \u2013 dancers, musicians, ritualists \u2013 in front of lushly animated projections.\n\nAt its centre are three figures personifying the sun, the moon and the stars. Their full-body costumes \u2013 gorgeously sculptural \u2013 recall masquerades from Senegal\u2019s Casamance region, with their all-enveloping silhouettes. The dried fronds and towering crest of the figure representing the stars suggest a Kumpo-like apparition, while the moon reads as a delicate crescent, with cowrie shells gleaming on dark cloth. The voltage that runs through Guewel comes from the drumming and dancing. Credit: Gregory Lorenzutti The costumes are impressive, but the voltage that runs through Guewel comes from the drumming and dancing. Hand-drum flurries launch sudden accelerations; legs carve lateral pathways as the dancers kick up their heels. The animations are often beautiful, with veils and translucencies, but at times the smoky effects pull focus from bodies onstage. The visual busyness dilutes the intimacy.\n\nStill, it\u2019s the projections that spell out the work\u2019s big ideas: everything is interwoven, nature moves in cycles. The cosmology is legible, even when dramaturgical transitions feel more ceremonial than exploratory. The figure representing the stars in Guewel, who harks back to West African masquerades. Credit: Gregory Lorenzutti What does it mean to really inhabit ancestral knowledge, not just cite it? Brief as it is, Guewel cannot offer a full answer. It plays more like a prelude that clears space for a deeper encounter. Seven years in gestation and framed as a cross-cultural collaboration, Guewel feels like the opening scene of a larger narrative \u2013 and makes you curious for the epic adventure to follow.\n\nReviewed by Andrew Fuhrmann\n\nTHEATRE\n\nThe Haunting of Spook Mansion (By Ghosts) \u2605\u2605\n\nChapel Off Chapel, until November 23 This paranormal piss-take from comedy writer Michael Ward (Shaun Micallef\u2019s Mad as Hell, RockWiz, I\u2019m A Celebrity \u2026 Get Me Out of Here) sports well-known comedic talent.

Chambers nearly declines \u2013 crackpot offers are common in the paranormal investigation biz \u2013 but he needs the cash.\n\nSo begins a ridiculous comedy horror haunted by every trope in the book, including an elderly potato-seller with a terrible provincial accent (Ben Russell) to warn the stranger off. Spook Mansion goes all in for cheesy visual tricks: bookcases, sinister portraits, a fireplace with strange objects on the mantel. Beth will summon poltergeists and apparitions in a seance; the source of the clangour in the basement will be discovered. Houghton and Emily Taheny lean into myriad horror tropes. Credit: Darren Gill Why has Chambers been lured to this place? All will come to light, as murderous secrets are revealed and a diabolical plot unmasked. Some of the buffoonery relies on pop culture references aimed at Boomer and Gen X audiences, but there are enough shameless hijinks on offer, under Russell Fletcher\u2019s direction, to get a giggle and a snort from anyone. As a mainstream lampoon of supernatural horror, The Haunting of Spook Mansion (By Ghosts) does the job, but it could be significantly improved. Plot points swarm the denouement like flying monkeys, in a way that makes final revelations difficult to follow. And the show sometimes feels like a TV comedy skit that got out of hand.",

        "text": "5. Tom Hooper - 6.5 One of the Wallabies best on a night of underwhelming performances. Topped both the Wallabies\u2019 carry and tackle counts. Was likened to Ireland\u2019s impressive middle-rower Tadgh Beirne in the pre-game call, and while he\u2019s not there yet, that\u2019s a realistic ambition for the youngster, who is still only 24 and is arguably the Wallabies\u2019 find (or re-discovery) of 2025. 6. Rob Valetini - 5.5 Took some big carries early in the first half and used his power in the contact zone. But fell out of the game in the second half. We haven\u2019t seen the same game-changing talents from big Bobby V in the last few months.\n\n7. Fraser McReight - 6 Pushed hard, and is always one of the Wallabies players searching to turn the game. Scored a well-taken try. But he was well negated by the Ireland forwards, and wasn\u2019t rewarded by the referee for his 50-50 poaching opportunities. 8. Harry Wilson - 5 Another whose effort is never in question. Puts his hand up for carries and hard tackles whenever they\u2019re needed. But the impact of those involvements ebbs and flows, and there is a question on Wilson\u2019s dwindling battery level, too. No one will enjoy a post-tour break more.\n\n9. Jake Gordon - 5 Kicking game was arguably a fraction off this week, with chasers rarely getting up for a contest. Gordon\u2019s work when recycling on attack in Ireland\u2019s red zone was sharp, but the problem was the Wallabies didn\u2019t get to it more often. 10. James O\u2019Connor - 4 Tough night for James O\u2019Connor, who was thrown headfirst into the mincer by Joe Schmidt in Dublin. Not even in the squad for the tour until this week, he was called in and then immediately given a starting jersey. And then tasked with running an unwise attacking game plan. James O\u2019Connor of Australia is tackled by Sam Prendergast. Credit: Getty Images\n\nNone of that excuses O\u2019Connor\u2019s skill errors. His rustiness was apparent. He was beaten in the air, too. But this was just another episode of the blindfolded darts game that is the Wallabies selection policy for the No.10. And it\u2019s left us no closer to getting answers. 11. Harry Potter - 4 As said every week about Potter: a mixed game. But this time the good - some impressive defence - was outweighed by poor work under the high ball, both defensively and offensively, and being caught out of position. Schmidt rates Potter as strong in the air, but it hasn\u2019t been apparent in recent outings. 12. Len Ikitau -5.5 Another who shone when the Wallabies had the ball in the Irish red zone, and were attacking directly. Ikitau plays as an extra back-rower in that zone, and also handles as a first receiver. A try was a good reward. But otherwise was passing out the back, and Ireland always had the answers.\n\n13. Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii - 5.5 Filipo Daugunu of Australia jumps for the ball with Mack Hansen. Credit: Getty Images Looked for ways to enter the game on attack and defended intelligently. And was even one of the few Wallabies to take a clean catch under a high ball. Are we wedded to Suaalii at No.13? Hands up if you think he should be the Wallabies\u2019 fullback against France. 14. Filipo Daugunu - 4 A big powerful ball runner, but had little opportunity other than one nice run, that was ruined by a loose inside pass. His high ball work was also not where it needs to be.\n\n15. Max Jorgensen - 3.5 Park this one and move on. Not a night to remember for the young superstar, with errors aplenty, many of which led to Irish tries. High balls were dropped, there were knock-ons, and the usually unshakeable confidence of Jorgensen was clearly shaken. Kudos to Schmidt, perhaps, for backing him, but Jorgensen should have moved to the wing when Kellaway came on. Reserves 16. Billy Pollard - 5 Powerful running on display, and his try was a good reward. But losing the lineout in the 64th minute was a bad miss, and while the lift and jump were off, this has to be bread-and-butter stuff at Test level.\n\n17. Tom Robertson - 4.5 Loading No major impact from Robertson, who keeps a scrum locked down and does his tight duties well. But he doesn\u2019t threaten as a ball carrier. 18. Zane Nonggorr - 3.5 Penalised for collapsing his first scrum and then slow on lift on Frost for that crucial missed lineout.\n\n19. Nick Frost - 3.5 Worked hard in a short time on the field, with eight tackles in 16 minutes. But then missed the key lineout and was binned for the last 10 minutes, which allowed Ireland to exploit his absence. 20. Carlo Tizzano - 4.5 Played a quarter but didn\u2019t get sighted with any big plays. Like McReight, he couldn\u2019t get on the ball. Question mark whether a second No.7 is a good use of the reserve back row slot, given McReight is an 80-minute player. 21. Ryan Lonergan - n/a",

Picture: Christian Gilles / NewsWire\n\n\u201cI mean this used to be a serious mainstream political party in this country and now it is overrun by the fringes,\u201d she told the ABC.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAsked what the response was from the Pacific, a region that is both a key strategic partner for Australia, as well as one of the world\u2019s most vulnerable to climate change, Senator Wong said the Coalition\u2019s climate policies had historically been met with apprehension.\n\n\u201cThe Pacific\u2019s view of the Coalition\u2019s approach to climate policy is well documented and it has become emblematic of the Coalition\u2019s disrespect for the Pacific.\n\n\u201cI mean, that was the case under Tony Abbott, that was the case under Scott Morrison, and regrettably, it is the case under Sussan Ley.\u201d\n\nAsked point-blank whether Pacific nations had criticised the Liberals and Nationals for abandoning net zero, Senator Wong said the region regarded \u201cclimate change as their number one issue\u201d.\n\nMs Wong said the Coalition\u2019s climate policies had long been met with apprehension in the Pacific. Picture: Supplied\n\n\u201cSo, when parties ostensibly of government in our country do this, or make jokes about water lapping at the door, or demonstrate to them that they simply are not prepared to act, what the Pacific take from that is disrespect.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cNow, we know our prosperity and our security is tied to our region.\n\n\u201cThis just demonstrates again that the Coalition not only would impose higher costs on Australians, but would impose a cost on Australia in our region.\u201d\n\nLib denies net zero stunt\n\nA Liberal frontbencher has shut down rumours the party\u2019s conservatives pulled a stunt as a bloc to try intimidate Sussan Ley to drop net zero.\n\nOn Wednesday, about 15 members of the Liberal Party\u2019s right faction, including leadership aspirants Andrew Hastie and Angus Taylor, entered a crucial party room meeting as a bloc.\n\nThey were accompanied by senators Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and Sarah Henderson, both outspoken critics of Ms Ley\u2019s leadership, among other conservative colleagues.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThat midweek meeting at Parliament House ultimately determined the party\u2019s decision to axe committing to a net zero emissions target, following months of internal divisions over energy policy.\n\nSeveral outspoken critics of Sussan Ley\u2019s leadership fronted a net zero party room meeting as a unit. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\nAsked whether the right faction\u2019s show of unity was a strategy designed to intimidate the Opposition Leader into dropping the contentious emissions target, opposition home affairs spokesman Jonathon Duniam told Sky News: \u201cNo, I think, as I say, there are people who will have similar views around a particular issue.\u201d\n\nMr Duniam, who was also part of the bloc appearance on Wednesday, said everyone in the pictured group believed the \u201cthe approach taken ultimately by the Liberal Party (was) the right one\u201d and all held the same views.\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s not really much to say about it, other than we\u2019re all good mates.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWe all believe in the same thing, and we look forward to winning the next election with a good policy suite.\u201d\n\nJonathon Duniam backed Ms Ley\u2019s leadership, saying the group\u2019s main motivation was their agreement on dropping net zero. Picture: Supplied\n\nHe added he was equally \u201cgreat mates\u201d with Mr Taylor and Mr Hastie, as he was with \u201cpeople that others would classify as moderates\u201d.\n\nAsked which of his self-described friends would make a better leader of the Liberals, Mr Duniam avoided answering, instead endorsing Ms Ley\u2019s leadership to take the party to the next election.\n\n\u201cWell Sussan Ley is our leader \u2026 I\u2019ve been asked multiple times: \u2018Do I support her?\u2019 And my answer is, as it has been on all of those occasions, I support her because she has she\u2019s the one who\u2019s guided us through this process. She\u2019s the one who\u2019s landed this policy outcome.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI look forward to working with her on other issues like migration, which is in the home affairs and immigration policy area.\n\nSussan Ley announced the Liberal Party would abandon net zero targets on Thursday. Picture: NewsWire / Martin Ollman\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m supporting Sussan Ley. She\u2019s our leader. She\u2019ll take us to the next election, and we are going to give it a red hot go and hold this appalling government to account.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the Liberals agreed to reducing emissions year-on-year within five year blocks, tying those reductions to comparable countries, and as quickly as technologies allow, as well as staying in the Paris Agreement, an international climate treaty that aims to keep global temperatures below 2C on pre-industrial levels.\n\nThe Coalition signed Australia up to it in 2016 and also set Australia\u2019s net zero by 2050 target in 2021.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIt comes as the Nationals abandoned net zero earlier this month.\n\nBoth changes paved the way to establish a new Coalition position on energy, which is due to be announced after a joint party room meeting on Sunday afternoon.",
