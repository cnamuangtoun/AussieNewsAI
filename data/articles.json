        "text": "On its face, it's a simple solution to a simple problem \u2014 many people are struggling to get home loans big enough to afford a property, so why not relax the rules around how much people can borrow?\n\nThat's what the Coalition is proposing to do, should it win the federal election on May 3.\n\nBut, first things first. What exactly is the \"mortgage serviceability buffer\" the Coalition plans to lower?\n\nHow the mortgage buffer works\n\nWhen you apply for a mortgage, the lender is under a legal obligation to make sure that any home loan it approves is \"not unsuitable\", given your financial circumstances.\n\nIn plain English, that means they need to check that you should be able to afford the repayments now and over the life of the loan without suffering financial hardship.\n\nThat's why lenders will ask you for details and proof about your income, expenses, existing debts, investments and more when you apply for a loan.\n\nFirst home buyers could soon get lower interest rates Photo shows A lady outside a melbourne suburban home A federal inquiry is considering whether there's a need to ease restrictions on banks about how much they can lend out to first home buyers.\n\nIn addition to this, banks and credit unions also have to follow rules from their regulator, APRA \u2014 the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.\n\nAPRA's primary job is to ensure that the financial system is secure and that the money depositors put into their savings accounts are safe \u2014 in other words, that banks, building societies and credit unions are not at risk of collapse.\n\nOne of the rules it has in place is an interest rate buffer when these lenders assess your mortgage application.\n\nAt the moment, that buffer is 3 percentage points. That means if the loan you are applying for has a current interest rate of 6 per cent, the bank must test if you could still afford the repayments if the rate rose to 9 per cent.\n\nThe idea behind this is that most mortgages run for 25-30 years and, as we have recently rediscovered, interest rates can change quite dramatically over time.\n\nWhat is the Coalition planning to do if elected?\n\nThe Coalition says that this buffer is too high, given that interest rates look likely to have peaked and are on the way down.\n\n\"I think most Australians could understand a high serviceability buffer when the cash rate was 0.1 per cent during COVID,\" Shadow Housing Minister Michael Sukkar told Radio National Breakfast.\n\n\" But now that we have elevated interest rates, a serviceability buffer that has not remained flexible with those changes is just blocking first home buyers from entering the market. \"\n\nCoalition promises to relax home lending rules Photo shows Aerial shot of dozens of houses in neat rows in a new outer-suburban housing estate. The financial regulator says household debt is already high and its \"serviceability buffer\" is appropriate. The Coalition says the high buffer is out of date and relaxing it would help more first home buyers into their own place.\n\nHe argued that first home buyers were particularly affected, given that they had no existing home equity and lower savings than older, more established households.\n\n\"Estimates from the industry are that nearly 40 per cent of potential first home buyers are not able to get finance for a loan, and therefore unable to buy a house, because primarily that serviceability buffer is now at 3 per cent,\" Mr Sukkar said.\n\nHe wouldn't be drawn further on the details of any change but, when pressed, suggested that the reduction might be modest.\n\n\"Two-and-a-half per cent is where it was at previously,\" he responded.\n\n\"So we're going to work with APRA in relation to that, as we did, to be frank, in the former Coalition government.\"\n\nHas the buffer always been this high?\n\nThe short answer is no, but it's more complicated than that.\n\nThe buffer was 2.5 per cent between mid-2019 and late-2021, at which point APRA raised it to 3 per cent because it was growing increasingly concerned by the home lending and house price boom sparked by the Reserve Bank's emergency COVID-level cash rate of just 0.1 per cent.\n\nAs I outlined in this December 2022 analysis, APRA's move to raise the buffer was arguably shutting the door after the horse had bolted.\n\nAPRA rate floor slip-up Photo shows A real estate sign in the front yard of a house in Sydney's south, with a sold sticker on it. A little-publicised decision by the obscure bank regulator may have done more to put Australians under mortgage stress than anything the Reserve Bank of Australia has done, writes Michael Janda.\n\nThe door that APRA belatedly shut was opened in the first place by the Morrison Coalition government, as Mr Sukkar referred to above, which oversaw APRA removing a floor on the mortgage serviceability test.\n\nWhat was this floor?\n\nIt was set at a minimum of 7 per cent at a time when the buffer was only 2 percentage points but it meant that, no matter how low interest rates fell, borrowers would have to at least be tested on whether they could afford their mortgage at a 7 per cent interest rate.\n\nAs explained in that 2022 analysis, its removal meant that when interest rates plunged during COVID-19 and many people could get a loan at interest rates below 2 per cent, those borrowers were only being tested against a rise in mortgage rates to 4.5 or 5 per cent.\n\nAfter the Reserve Bank finished hiking rates in November 2023, the average variable mortgage rate on outstanding owner-occupier loans was 6.3 per cent \u2014 a lot higher than many borrowers from 2020 and 2021 had been tested against.\n\nSo are there options to cut the buffer but still protect borrowers?\n\nWhile no-one expects mortgage interest rates to fall back to 2 or even 3 per cent again, no-one expected them to fall that low in the first place until COVID-19 hit.\n\nThe lack of an interest rate floor on the serviceability test after mid-2019 meant that a bunch of borrowers ended up with loans they couldn't afford, triggering a steep rise in mortgage hardship and property sales when interest rates rose sharply.\n\nThe mortgage cliff warnings are there if you look Photo shows A smiling brown-haired woman puts a 'sold' sticker on a 'for auction' sign outside a house. A surge in home loan hardship requests and a record number of quick resales are two signs that Australia is still perilously close to the edge of the mortgage cliff.\n\nSo, with the Coalition saying that final details of any change to the mortgage serviceability test would be negotiated with APRA, this would offer an opportunity to lower the buffer but reintroduce a floor.\n\nThe average discounted \"indicator\" owner-occupier variable lending rate over the roughly two decades the Reserve Bank data goes back is 5.74 per cent, so quite close to current levels.\n\nThere have been 60 out of 250 months, or close to a quarter of the time, when the average discounted variable rate has been above 7 per cent.\n\nSo that makes a 7 per cent floor actually look quite risky.\n\nIn that 20-year period, there were just nine months \u2014 in the lead-up to the global financial crisis in 2008 \u2014 when variable home loan rates were typically above 8 per cent.\n\nSo, perhaps it wouldn't be a bad idea to bring the mortgage serviceability buffer back to 2.5 or even 2 percentage points, but with a 7.5 or 8 per cent floor on the test.\n\nThis would give prospective home buyers extra borrowing capacity in the short term, but safeguard against risky credit booms if rates dropped back to low levels in the future.\n\nWhile reducing the buffer might spark a temporary uplift in home prices, the reintroduction and maintenance of a higher floor would prevent the kind of cheap credit-induced house price booms we saw during COVID-19, when interest rates fall to unusually low levels.\n\nLoading\n\nWill the Coalition's policy make housing more affordable?\n\nQuite simply, no. In fact, the opposite.\n\nWhile lowering the mortgage serviceability buffer will allow first home buyer X to borrow more, it will also allow potential buyers Y and Z to borrow more too.\n\nUnless the reduced floor is only for first home buyers, then Y and Z might be upgraders or investors.\n\nIf all three turn up at the same auction, they will be able to bid more for the property than before the serviceability buffer was lowered.\n\nThe most likely result is that the home will sell at a higher price.\n\nHow Australia's housing market spun out of control Photo shows Woman with blonde hair and a white jacked in front of a black and white photograph of a wooden pier Property investment is ingrained in the Australian psyche, but is it too easy to cast landlords as the villain in our housing crisis?\n\nReplicated across the whole housing market, the almost inevitable result is that home prices will rise.\n\nHousing will become less, not more, affordable and most of the people who were locked out of the market before will remain locked out of the market.\n\nIn the end, it is not solely the size of loan you can get that determines whether you can buy, but whether that loan is big enough to pay the current market price for the home you want.\n\nA policy that increases the capacity to pay, what economists call a \"demand side\" policy, will, other things being equal, simply result in higher prices.\n\nIf the supply side was more responsive, that might limit the price increase by seeing that extra demand channelled into more home building.\n\nBut, let's face it, even with fewer planning restrictions, it's not exactly quick to build a lot more housing, as governments around Australia should have learned over the past few years. So prices would jump in the short term before construction could catch up.\n\nLoading...\n\nAnd we don't need hypothetical economic models to tell us this.\n\nAfter APRA introduced stricter lending rules, the Australian property market slipped into a downturn between 2017 and 2019.\n\nWhen those rules were eased and rates fell further, prices started rising, then took off as rates plunged, even as the borders were closed and population growth (physical demand for housing) stalled.\n\nThe more people can borrow, the more they will pay for homes. The immediate winners from any relaxation in mortgage lending rules will be existing property owners, especially investors, as well as banks and real estate agents.\n\nLoading...\n\nHaving trouble seeing this form?

(Getty Images: Michael Dodge)\n\nBut Roos said the work Krakouer did outside football following a prison term he served in the late 2000s was an important element of his story.\n\n\"I had some emails from Andrew about three or four years ago, we were looking to do a program in a prison together, and then COVID hit,\" Roos said.\n\nLoading...\n\n\"I think [it's a story] of redemption, it's really sad. I didn't know him well, but Matty Richardson, Nathan Buckley, they all speak highly of him, and my interactions with him were always fantastic.\"\n\nKrakouer was delisted from Richmond at the end of 2007, returning to Perth to play for Swan Districts in the WAFL.\n\nThe following year, he was convicted of assault with intent to cause bodily harm and was sentenced to four years in jail.

        "text": "An updated list of grievances published by the United States trade office has set its sights on Australia's pharmaceutical sector, biosecurity protections and laws requiring the social media giants to pay for news.\n\nBut the prime minister has vowed none will be touched \"on my watch\", as the federal government toughens its language against the Trump administration.\n\nThe annual US Foreign Trade Barriers report offers an itemised list of issues America believes are affecting its exports, from Algeria to Vietnam and almost everyone in-between.\n\nBut with US President Donald Trump due to announce a fresh round of tariffs on April 2, dubbed \"liberation day\", the report highlights where the administration might seek to retaliate.\n\nUS critical of Australian biosecurity laws\n\nThe report names biosecurity \"barriers\" to US beef, pork, poultry, apples and pears, saying the US \"continues to seek full market access\" for fresh produce to be exported.\n\nAustralia has particularly strict biosecurity laws to protect native wildlife that is vulnerable to foreign diseases that have largely been kept from Australian shores.\n\nFor example, Australia prohibits US apples and pears based on concerns of several pests, such as the bacterial disease fire blight \u2014 which the report acknowledges, and contests.\n\nThe trade report again raises concerns over Australia's pharmaceutical laws, which the US pharma industry has long opposed.\n\nAnd it raises the News Media Bargaining Code, legislated under the former Morrison government, which requires social media giants to support news organisations in recognition of the benefits they receive from news content hosted on their platforms.\n\nIn a toughening of Australia's stance on the coming tariffs, Mr Albanese repeated on Tuesday morning that Australia would not weaken its laws to appease the US.\n\n\"The report has three things that are of concern, at least, to Australia: one is the news bargaining code, the second is pharmaceuticals and the third is biosecurity,\" Mr Albanese said.\n\n\"Those issues are not up for negotiation.\n\n\"Not on my watch. We will negotiate sensibly but we won't undermine the biosecurity system.\"\n\nOpposition Leader Peter Dutton also ruled out negotiating on those issues.\n\n\"No, and I agree with the prime minister\u2019s position, and I'd say this: I will stand up for our country's interests every day if I am given the great honour of being prime minister,\" Mr Dutton said.\n\n\"I'll stand up for our interest and negotiate the best possible outcome for Australia and I will not compromise on any of that for our country.\"\n\nGovernment prepared to fail to win exemption\n\nAustralia is continuing to negotiate with the United States in an attempt to secure exemptions from any incoming tariffs, arguing that because Australia imports more than it exports to the US, it should not be penalised.\n\nHowever, that trade surplus argument was not enough to win exemptions from tariffs on steel and aluminium imposed by Mr Trump last month, and the government is aware this argument might fail again.\n\nLabor reluctant to buy Trump tariff exemption Photo shows three men in a composite image two wearing glasses and one with a orange-tinged skin Australian officials continue to talk to their American counterparts, but Labor is reluctant to pay a substantial price to win an exemption from fresh US tariffs.\n\nBut Australian negotiators are unwilling to offer any major concessions in order to strike a \"deal\" with Mr Trump, who has openly called for foreign nations to make offerings that would benefit the US in order to secure exemptions.\n\nMr Albanese said today that weakening Australian laws to escape tariffs estimated to have a minor direct impact to the economy would be like \"cutting off our own nose\".\n\nShadow Trade Minister Kevin Hogan said the Coalition expected the government to secure exemptions.\n\n\"With the way some of the officials are talking in the US, that's what we're hoping for \u2026 [But] it does appear the PM is hiding behind officials,\" he said.\n\nThe Coalition maintains that Mr Albanese should have sought to meet with Mr Trump in person to put Australia's case.",

Kimonis is a clinical psychologist and director of the Parent-Child Research Clinic at the University of New South Wales.\n\nShe says swearing at children can be a \"form of emotional abuse\" and linked to harmful outcomes for some children.\n\nWhile our experts aren't aware of any research that indicates swearing around children is directly harmful, Professor Kimonis says it may be damaging in ways we don't expect.\n\n\"Even if a parent is OK with swearing at home, the problem is that children haven't necessarily learnt the who, what, when of swearing, and when it's appropriate.\n\n\"If parents are not teaching them when and how it's OK to swear, then they might be swearing at school as well,\" she says, adding that could cause them problems in the classroom.\n\nABC Lifestyle Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday. You\u2019ll also receive a monthly newsletter of our best recipes.\n\nParenting expert and family counsellor Rachel Schofield says kids' swearing might also be harmful if they are using it \"to be nasty\".\n\n\"They might be using it in a way that is hurtful to others around them.\"\n\nHowever, it is less likely kids will use curse words in that way, research shows.\n\nProfessor Bergen told ABC Radio National a long-term observational study that looked at children swearing in the \"real world\" found they were \"overwhelmingly\" using swearing in pro-social ways, such as making friends or to smooth social interactions.\n\nWhy children start swearing\n\nResearch has found that children's vocabulary of swear words expands rapidly from ages one to two, to ages three to four, in parallel to the general explosion in language in the toddler and preschooler years.\n\nIt found that by the time children began school at age five, they already knew 42 taboo words.\n\nShould we lie about Santa? Photo shows Two small children stare out the window wearing Christmas outfits What if some of my son's peers don't get as many presents as him? Is using Santa as a bribe for good behaviour healthy?\n\nProfessor Kimonis says children learn through imitation \u2014 watching what the adults around them do.\n\n\"When those adults model a behaviour like swearing, then the child is more likely to swear.\"\n\nAnd our reaction to that will determine if they keep swearing or not, she says.\n\n\"If the reaction is positive, like where a parent laughs and doesn't give a consequence, then they're probably going to continue swearing.\"\n\nWhat works for one family might not another\n\nProfessor Kimonis says whether it's OK for our kids to swear is not \"a black [and] white issue\".\n\n\" It's family and child specific. \"\n\nFor parents who don't want their children to use profanity, she suggests \"planned ignoring\".\n\n\"That's where we help a parent to ignore the behaviour by not giving it any attention.\n\n\"This only works if you pair it with giving attention when the child is doing an appropriate thing like talking respectfully.\"\n\nThere are experts who argue planned ignoring can be harmful, so parents should talk to a professional and decide what is most appropriate for their child.\n\nMs Schofield says for some families, it may come down to context.\n\n\"Is it just used as a way to express some frustration? Or is it used in anger?\n\n\"It's about the culture within the family; what's OK and what's not \u2014 every family gets to decide what is OK in their family.\"",

        "text": "Plenty of people dream of quitting their office jobs to pursue their passion, to shake off the shackles of a nine-to-five job and fully commit to the thing that makes their eyes sparkle.\n\nLoading TikTok content\n\nBut only a tiny fraction of people will actually be allowed to experience this.\n\nUgandan-born, Brisbane-based comedian Anisa Nandaula is one of them.\n\nAfter years of nightly gigs in the often-unpaid Brisbane stand-up scene, Anisa turned to TikTok, quickly amassing more than 300,000 followers and scoring appearances on Channel 10's Thank God You're Here and the upcoming season five of Taskmaster.\n\nAt the start of 2025, Anisa felt she had enough of a foothold in her comedy career to \u2014 joyously \u2014 ditch her day job.\n\n\"The best way to describe it is, you know when your partner comes home and they said there was cake at work, and they brought some for you because it was left over,\" Anisa says.\n\n\"It's like that feeling.\"\n\nComing to Australia\n\nAnisa was born in Uganda and migrated with her mother and siblings to Rockhampton in North Queensland when she was seven years old.\n\nShe quickly realised she and her siblings were the only African kids in their primary school. After a year, the family migrated to Brisbane, where she started to feel more at ease.\n\n\"The children weren't as shocked to see me, they wouldn't stare as much,\" Anisa says.\n\nLoading Instagram content\n\nBut the pressure to look like a majority of her classmates remained, with Anisa straightening her hair, using skin-bleaching products and even putting honey in her eyes in an attempt to lighten their colour.\n\nNowadays, she realises her teenage self was \"beyond perfect\".\n\nIf she could, she'd go back and tell teenage Anisa: \"Every single thing that you pray for God to change are all the things that are going to make you successful.\n\n\"Hold on to them as tight as you can.\"\n\nFrom poetry to comedy\n\nAfter graduating high school and embarking on a political science degree, Anisa took her first steps towards the stage through slam poetry. Like many things she turned her hand to, she rocketed to the top.\n\nIn 2016, she was crowned Queensland Poetry Slam Champion.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nPoetry taught her how to be comfortable on stage with an audience looking right at her, but she wanted something more.\n\n\"I got tired of making people sad or making people ponder, I just want to make them laugh,\" she says.\n\nSo she stepped into Brisbane's stand-up comedy scene which, while not as robust as the Melbourne or Sydney scenes, accepted Anisa with open arms.\n\n\"After every gig, I would talk to the headliner for an hour and do that as often as I could,\" she says.\n\n\"The community taught me everything. I would not have achieved anything I have without my peers and comedy mentors.\"\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nShe started doing seven, eight, nine spots a week \u2014 jetting from one side of Brisbane to the other, down to the Gold Coast and up to the Sunshine Coast \u2014 anything that would give her more stage time.\n\n\"Stand-up is trial and error. It's the only way to get good. I would hear comedians be like, 'You shouldn't gig so much. You should live life.' But there's no other way. The more you do it, the better you are. And there's no way around that,\" Anisa says.\n\nThe love of the craft, encouragement from her peers and a determination to give comedy her all, pushed Anisa to keep doing the gigs nearly every night.\n\n\" I had a pretty good life before stand-up. Like, I was a slam poet, I was making six figures. So I was like, 'I have to make something of myself. Otherwise, why am I leaving my good life?' \"\n\nTikTok shock\n\nDespite her nose-to-the-grindstone attitude, there was a point a couple years ago when movement in Anisa's comedy career stalled. She wasn't making any breakthrough with the channels that traditionally put new Australian comics on the path to the mainstream.\n\nLoading TikTok content\n\n\"I was doing like two to three gigs a night, every single night, like working as hard as I could, and I was just getting nowhere,\" she says.\n\n\"All the conventional points that you're meant to take as a stand-up \u2014 do RAW, and then you do Comedy Zone \u2014 these are all the things that you're meant to do to get success. And I just wasn't getting any.\"\n\nSo Anisa pivoted to the unconventional.\n\nShe took clips of her stand-up and uploaded them onto TikTok. They started doing numbers so she began uploading bits straight to camera.\n\n\"I started getting recognised by people in real life for my TikTok. I think I only had like 5,000 followers at the time. But just the fact that my comedy was resonating with people I was like, 'I could make something of this.'\"\n\nThose 5,000 followers have now turned into an audience of more than 340,000 on TikTok. Add on Instagram and in Anisa's videos, she reaches a combined audience of more than half a million people.\n\nSoon after the online world sat up to take notice of Anisa's talent, the mainstream world caught up.\n\nIn October last year, the comedian performed on an episode of Channel 10's Thank God You're Here and, later in the year, she'll star as one of the season-long contestants on the channel's comedy show, Taskmaster.\n\nEven as her star rises, Brisbane locals still have a good chance of catching one of Anisa's sets at an open mic around the city. She's not doing as many five-minute spots anymore, but she remains an active member of the scene.\n\nWhile it's tradition for comedians to venture to Melbourne or Sydney to further their career, Anisa says she's a Brisbane \"loyalist\". (Supplied: Emma Holland)\n\nAs she embarks on a national tour of her debut stand-up hour, You Can't Say That, Anisa says comedy has not only given her a new career path but a better understanding of her adopted home country.\n\n\"I have a friend and she's a migration agent, and she said that when migrants are assimilating, the last thing that they learn is the local humour. It takes the average immigrant about 15 years to understand the humour of the country,\" Anisa explains.\n\n\"I think once you understand what makes people laugh, you understand everything about them. So stand-up comedy definitely helped me feel Australian.\"\n\nAnisa Nanduala: You Can't Say That is at Melbourne, Brisbane and Sydney comedy festivals.",

(Supplied: Henry Murray)\n\nThere are an estimated 13.3 million head of cattle, about 2.7m sheep and some 713,000 goats in Queensland.\n\nThe DPI also confirmed 3,183 kilometres of fencing had been impacted, along with 4,076km of private roads.\n\nThose number are expected to increase in the coming days.\n\nState Primary Industries Minister Tony Perrett said the impact would be devastating for producers and the industry.\n\n\"When you get those sorts of losses and those numbers are expected to grow, that's their livelihoods that, in some cases, have been washed away in front of them,\" he said.\n\n\" It's a devastating impact just on their business, but also on their mental health. \"\n\nA herd of sheep survive by finding a shrinking patch of high ground near Windorah.

(ABC News)\n\nMr Murray and his family have been dropped from helicopters in recent days to find livestock on foot and move them out of water.\n\nHe said some cattle were found \"bogged to the brisket\" and had to be put down because they could not be extracted from the thick mud.\n\nThe full scale of the losses will not be known until the floodwater has subsided. (Supplied: Henry Murray)\n\n\"We've managed to get a lot out, but we've stopped looking for some,\" Mr Murray said.\n\n\"That's a dead loss. We're concentrating mainly saving the ones we can save.\n\n\"We spent four hours walking 120 sheep to get them to an area where they weren't standing in water.\"\n\nMr Murray said the number of dead livestock was likely to grow given the forecast for more rainfall over the coming days in already drenched parts of the west.\n\nMore rain is forecast during the middle of the week, which may result in small renewed river and creek level rises.\n\nMore than 100,000 animals are thought to have perished or be missing amid the devastating floods. (Supplied: Brendan Murray)\n\n\"If it rains, we'll lose them,\" Mr Murray said.\n\n\"There's nowhere we can go with them.\n\n\"Even 20mm of rain will finish off what is left \u2014 they just won't live it out.\"\n\nRecovery could take years\n\nAgForce Queensland general president Shane McCarthy said he had seen stock losses of up to 80 per cent in some areas.\n\nLivestock losses in the west are expected to heavily impact some producers. (Supplied: Shane Wendleborne)\n\nBut the impact across graziers will vary depending on their herds, he said.\n\n\"Any stock loss is not good and we need as many as possible alive,\" Mr McCarthy said.\n\n\" If you've gone and lost 100 per cent of your stock, that's catastrophic. \"\n\nHe the true numbers would not be revealed until the floods subsided.\n\nGraziers are taking to the sky to asses livestock deaths on their properties. (Supplied: Henry Murray)\n\n\"[Livestock] could be still alive but washed away, and we've got to find them and get them back \u2026 [but] they could be dead and washed away,\" Mr McCarthy said.\n\n\"At the moment they're just trying to move stock around, get them to high and dry ground, drop fodder to those animals that are still hanging around so that we can keep those stock alive and healthy.\n\n\"It takes years to build back numbers, and not to mention the time and effort of genetics that you've put into your livestock.\"",

(ABC News: Andrew O'Connor)\n\nThe Department of Premier and Cabinet will now include a new Office of Defence Industries, with a big focus on AUKUS, and a new Office of Early Childhood.\n\nThe DPC will also take leadership on Aboriginal affairs policy, an area the premier has previously worked in, to help oversee better social outcomes and project development.\n\nThe major shake-up is the creation of a Department of Transport and Major Infrastructure, with a new Office of Major Infrastructure Delivery to build Westport and hospitals like the Women's and Babies Hospital and upgrades to Royal Perth and Midland hospitals.\n\nWA Treasurer Rita Saffioti says experience will be key in the new departments. (ABC News: Keane Bourke)\n\nThe government said this would be a \"centre of excellence\" for the construction and management of major projects, bringing together the best engineers and minds.\n\n\"Managing billion-dollar contracts is difficult and what you want are people that have gone through it a few times, know what to look out for and know how to improve,\" Treasurer Rita Saffioti said.\n\n\"That's what we're doing.\"\n\nThat new department will be paired with a new Department of Housing and Works, taking over responsibility for building, maintaining, and managing the state's social housing stock from the Department of Communities.\n\nIt will also oversee building and maintaining smaller projects, like schools and police stations, instead of the Department of Finance.\n\n\"In a sense a big builder and a little builder,' Ms Saffioti said.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Works will try to tackle the state's building woes.

What does Labor have to show for its total control?\n\n\"We understand that these changes will be inconvenient to some people, and we also understand and acknowledge that it's a lot to take in,\" Mr Cook said.\n\nThe changes are not part of any austerity measures or designed to save the budget money.\n\n\"We're progressing this on the basis of cost neutrality,\" Mr Cook said.\n\n\"It's not a savings exercise. We expect the departments to absorb the costs associated with this in the normal manner in which they would expect to integrate this as part of overall management.\n\n\" We're not expecting to see any losses of staff \u2026 This is about reforms that are focused on the delivery, particularly in relation to our key priorities. \"\n\nThe Community and Public Sector Union/Civil Service Association of WA (CPSU/CSA) said the changes had likely made thousands of public sector workers uneasy.\n\n\"Restructures to government departments are difficult for workers, and the union will be ensuring public sector workers are front and centre of discussions over the next twelve months,\" union state secretary Melanie Bray said.\n\nWhat is the government trying to achieve?\n\nThe government thinks this is the best way to deliver services and infrastructure, especially hospitals and houses, quickly and efficiently, with minimum problems.\n\nIt knows the public expects a high standard in health and housing and it also knows how much political pain there will be if there are blunders, delays and blow outs.\n\n\"This is about making sure we have the best people to deliver these projects,\" Ms Saffioti said.\n\nThe Department of Transport will become the Department of Transport and Major Infrastructure.

(ABC News: Matt Roberts)\n\nThe Coalition says a \"one-size-fits-all\" rule to assessing serviceability is stopping tens of thousands of Australians from getting a home loan \"even when they can meet repayments with a prudent margin against unexpected future rate rises\".\n\nCurrently, the financial regulator's priority is ensuring banks are not taking on too many risky loans, which dampens borrowing power.\n\nEasing lending rules would make it easier for first home buyers, but would it create financial instability? Photo shows A lady outside a melbourne suburban home A federal inquiry is considering whether there's a need to ease restrictions on banks about how much they can lend out to first home buyers.\n\nThe Coalition would change the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority's mandate to allow it to take borrowers into greater consideration.\n\nHowever, APRA's chair has urged that the serviceability buffer remains at 3 per cent, saying late last year household debt was already high relative to incomes, and higher than in other nations.\n\n\"This high household debt is a key vulnerability if adverse economic scenarios came to pass,\" APRA chair John Lonsdale said in November.\n\nMr Sukkar said it was understandable to have a high buffer during COVID, but it should be responsive and react to the market.\n\nThe shadow housing minister noted it was lifted from 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent in 2021 during the pandemic.\n\nThe Coalition says it will also require APRA to adjust how loans backed by Lenders Mortgage Insurance are treated, so that people without access to \"the bank of mum and dad\" are punished by higher borrowing costs.\n\nIn essence, the Coalition would seek to no longer require banks to hold more capital against LMI-backed loans, which sets a premium on those loans that leads to banks charging higher interest rates on them.\n\nThe major banks and property groups have backed more relaxed lending rules.\n\nTreasurer Jim Chalmers recently ordered APRA to disregard HELP repayments when assessing an applicant's ability to service their mortgage, if those debts are close to being paid off.",

        "text": "Every so often, the music world is delighted by the discovery of musical works by long-dead classical greats, only to feel immense disappointment when some turn out to be fake.\n\nThe music world, just like other arts communities, is no stranger to deceptions.\n\nOver the last 150 years, many musical forgers have published their music as Bach, Mozart, Haydn or lesser-known composers from history.\n\nPlagiarism cases also showed musicians claiming other people's works as their own.\n\nWhat motivated them to make these false claims?\n\nRiding on famous composers' names\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, French brothers Henri and Marius Casadesus regularly unearthed musical masterworks by Mozart, Handel, Carl Phillip Emanuel Bach and Johann Christoph Bach. The Casadesus brothers both performed and published those musical scores.\n\nMusicologists eventually found out the brothers composed most of the music they claimed they unearthed. But by the time the ruse was uncovered, the music had been frequently recorded with the false attributions.\n\nABC Classic Mornings presenter Russell Torrance believes money was the motivation behind the Casadesus forgeries.\n\n\"People are more interested in music by Mozart than music by some random publisher-guy,\" he says.\n\nSelling sheet music was quite lucrative in the past. But it wasn't until the 19th century when music publishing took off that composers became more assertive about the authorship of their music.\n\nTorrance says the Casadesus brothers tried to meet the demand from people's curiosity and enthusiasm for music from the past. He admits he found their prank ingenious.\n\n\"To pass off their music as someone else's, they must've been very skilled composers,\" he says.\n\nMusic lost for hundreds of years unearthed and brought back to life Photo shows Lang Lang seated at a grand piano facing toward the camera with one elbow propped on the lid and his head resting in his hand. In 2024, music lovers got to hear new music by long-dead composers Mozart and Chopin.\n\nMoney isn't the only reason people commit musical forgeries.\n\n\"There are women who've used the idea of a musical hoax to get around the fact that women aren't always taken seriously,\" says Alice Keath, presenter of What's On and Weekend Baroque at ABC Classic.\n\nShe highlights the case of 19th-century German composer Fanny Mendelssohn who published some of her music under her brother Felix's name.\n\nAfter marrying a supportive husband and meeting fellow composer Clara Schumann, Fanny published music under her own name.\n\nStealing someone else's music\n\nOne of the more serious musical hoaxes happened in the 2000s.\n\nBritish pianist Joyce Hatto is what researcher Lisa Giombini calls \"a prodigy of old age\".\n\nWith the help of her producer husband, William Barrington-Coupe, Hatto released no less than 1,103 CDs despite being seriously ill with cancer.\n\nAfter Hatto's death, it was discovered that \"She hadn't played one single note of all this impressive number of recordings,\" Dr Giombini says.\n\nMany of Hatto's recordings were performances by lesser-known artists, re-released under her name after being digitally-treated by Barrington-Coupe. It was a classic case of plagiarism.\n\nThe deception came to light when Hatto's CDs were put through recording databases which identified the original performers.\n\nDr Giombini, who has researched many musical forgeries and plagiarism cases, explains why many people feel betrayed by Hatto's deception:\n\n\" Experts and amateurs were thrilled by the idea of this old lady playing the piano like a young virtuoso. \"\n\nEven though the discovery was made a few years before his death in 2014, Barrington-Coupe was never prosecuted for his part in the musical theft.\n\nDifferent attitudes towards authorship\n\nMost musical hoaxes involve composers who are long dead.\n\nMany of them were from the eras known as the baroque and classical music periods which span 1600-1800.\n\nMost music scores from this time were scattered in private collections and archives which were not catalogued, making it easier for forgers to slip something in.\n\nKeath cites Albinoni's Adagio, a piece of music which was supposed to exemplify a baroque composer's style but was instead written by his 20th-century biographer Remo Giazotto.\n\nAnother example is the much-recorded Ave Maria by 20th-century composer Vladimir Vavilov. After Vavilov's death, his music was misattributed to a 16th-century Italian composer Giulio Caccini.\n\nIt's believed one of the performers involved in recording Vavilov's music was behind this misattribution, assuming a long dead composer had more cachet than a recently dead one.\n\nLoading YouTube content\n\nKeath says our attitude towards composers has changed over time, with people having a different idea of musical authorship in the past.\n\nIn the baroque era, \"there were a lot of musical themes which composers passed around, so you don't really know who initially wrote it,\" Keath says.\n\nComposers like Vivaldi, Bach and Handel borrowed tunes from their contemporaries as well as their own previously-written music.\n\nThis kind of borrowing was considered as a mark of respect and admiration.\n\nWhy we fall for hoaxes and deceptions\n\nNowadays, it's much harder to commit musical forgeries.\n\nA recent discovery of a Chopin Waltz in the New York's Morgan Library and Museum archives underwent extensive tests to prove its authenticity.\n\nBut it doesn't mean we're immune from hoaxers and pranksters.\n\nThe arts world, for instance, was rocked by the revelation last year that some Picasso paintings at Tasmania's Museum of Old and New Art were fakes, painted by local artist Kirsha Kaechele.\n\nIn recent times large learning machine databases which power AI music generators have dwarfed the kind of plagiarism pulled off by Hatto and Barrington-Coupe.\n\nWhat we know about the artists behind the music can influence how we appreciate their works, Dr Giombini says.\n\nBut Torrance doesn't think it means we should stop enjoying some of these hoax pieces, with one caveat:\n\n\" You've got to be honest and tell the audience the whole story. \"\n\nSign up to the ABC Classic Newsletter",

        "text": "Such neck-twisting turns have become routine for the US stock market recently because of uncertainty about what Trump will do with tariffs \u2014 and by how much they will worsen inflation and grind down growth for economies. Wall Street\u2019s swings followed a sell-off that spanned the world earlier on Monday as worries built about the effects of the tariffs that Trump says will bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. \u201cThe best way to summarize this trading environment is frustration and fatigue,\u201d said Joe Gilbert, a portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a clear playbook on how to proceed.\u201d In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index dropped 4 per cent. South Korea\u2019s Kospi sank 3 per cent, and France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 1.6 per cent. Instead of stocks, prices strengthened for things considered safer bets when the economy is looking shaky. Gold rose again to briefly crest $3160 per ounce. Prices for US Treasury bonds also climbed, which in turn sent their yields down. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.21 per cent from 4.27 per cent late Friday and from roughly 4.80 per cent in January.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United States is set to begin what Trump calls \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, which will be tailored to match what he sees is the burden each country places on his, including things like value-added taxes. Much is still unknown, including exactly what the US government will do on \u201cLiberation Day\u201d. At Goldman Sachs, economists expect Trump to announce an average 15 per cent reciprocal tariff. They also raised their forecast for inflation and lowered it for US economic growth for the end of the year. Loading They now see a 35 per cent chance of recession in the next year, up from an earlier forecast of 20 per cent, \u201creflecting our lower growth forecast, falling confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating willingness to tolerate economic pain,\u201d according to Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle. If the April 2 tariffs end up being less onerous than investors fear \u2014 maybe Trump includes no additional tariff increases on China, for example \u2014 stocks could rally. But if they end up being a worst-case scenario, which gets businesses so fearful that they start cutting their workforces, stocks could sink much further.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also the chance that April 2 does little to clear the uncertainty. It could end up being a \u201cstepping stone for further negotiations\u201d instead of a \u201cclearing event\u201d for the market, according to Michael Wilson and other strategists at Morgan Stanley. \u201cThis means policy uncertainty and growth risks are likely to persist \u2014 it\u2019s a question of to what degree,\u201d Wilson wrote in a report. One worry is that even if Trump\u2019s tariffs end up being less harsh than feared, all the uncertainty created by them alone could cause US households and businesses to freeze their spending, which would hurt an economy that had been running at a solid pace to close last year. Either way, some familiar names were among Wall Street\u2019s hardest hit on Monday. Tesla fell 1.7 per cent to bring its loss for the year so far to 35.8 per cent. It\u2019s been one of the year\u2019s worst performers in the S&P 500 in large part because of fears that the electric-vehicle maker\u2019s brand has become too intertwined with its CEO, Elon Musk.\n\nMusk has been leading US government efforts to cut spending, making him a target of growing political anger, and protests have swarmed Tesla showrooms as a result. Other Big Tech stocks also struggled. They\u2019ve been at the sell-off\u2019s centre in large part because of criticism that their stock prices had become too expensive. Critics pointed to how their prices rose faster than their already quick-growing profits in recent years. Nvidia, which has ridden the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology to become one of Wall Street\u2019s most influential stocks, fell 1.2 per cent to bring its loss for the year so far to 19.3 per cent. On the winning side of Wall Street, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway rose 1.2 per cent and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. The parent of GEICO and other companies said earlier this year it\u2019s sitting on $334.2 billion in unused cash. Such a large amount could indicate Buffett, who\u2019s famous for buying when prices are low, may see little worth purchasing in a stock market that critics had called too expensive. with AP/Bloomberg",

        "text": "Now, however, the chances of a return to Russia \u2013 if not the extraction of proper payment for stolen assets \u2013 has risen with Donald Trump in the White House and new messaging from US officials about reopening economic ties with Russia. Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said last month he expected \u201ca number of American companies will return to the Russian market as early as in the second quarter of the year\u201d. Some Western businesses have already laid the groundwork to return. French carmaker Renault sold all of its shares in Renault Russia and its 67.69 per cent interest in Russia\u2019s AvtoVAZ in May 2022, but this agreement includes an option for Renault to buy back its interest in AvtoVAZ that is exercisable for six years. Luca de Meo, the Renault chief, last month refused to rule out a return to Russia. However, officials have since said the carmaker would need to pay $US1.3 billion to do so.\n\nExecutives should also be wary: analysts warn that Putin is using Western businesses as a pawn in his games with Europe and the US. Lost Western assets and cash have become a bargaining chip in negotiations over a potential peace deal on Ukraine \u2013 and a way of dividing Europe. Renault chief Luca de Meo has refused to rule out a return to Russia. Credit: Bloomberg \u201cAs sanctions have proliferated, the Kremlin has increasingly come to the view that Russian assets of multinational firms are useful collateral for frozen assets abroad,\u201d says Ian Massey, at S-RM consultants. Europe and the US have frozen some $US300 billion in Russia\u2019s overseas assets, something that has irked the Kremlin. Austria\u2019s Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) is battling a \u20ac2 billion ($3.4 billion) fine imposed by a Russian court in January, which officials said was compensation for frozen assets in Austria. \u201cWe had only 10 minutes to make our case in court,\u201d says RBI spokesperson Christof Danz. The defendant was flanked by armed people wearing balaclavas. RBI is appealing the ruling and has its next court hearing on April 24.\n\n\u201cThe presence of Western businesses in Russia and the kind of leverage that gives [Putin] over certain European countries has been one of the most useful tools in the Kremlin\u2019s toolbox for years,\u201d says Patrick Sewell, of Control Risks, a consultancy. Loading With the Ariston decision, Putin may also be trying to divide Europe by signalling that countries that take a softer line to Moscow may get their assets back, he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite plausible that Putin would be happy to allow certain Western companies to take back their assets in a way that drives a wedge between different members of the EU. \u201cItaly has sometimes been a kind of soft target for Russia. They\u2019ve typically been among the more Russian friendly-countries of the EU, the Italian business community has always been very active in Moscow.\u201d\n\nPutin\u2019s response to the tidal wave of Western sanctions that hit Russia after the war began was a vicious attack on foreign businesses operating in the state. Of the $US167 billion lost since 2022, $US57 billion has been lost by 30 companies who have had their assets forcibly seized, according to the KSE Institute. These included French yoghurt maker Danone and Danish brewer Carlsberg, both of which have since sold their Russian assets and cut their losses. Putin also imposed blocks on companies trying to escape. Until last autumn, businesses selling assets in Russia had to take a 50 per cent hit on the sale price and pay an exit tax on the proceeds of 15 per cent. In October, Russia raised the discount to 60 per cent and the exit fee to 35 per cent. Transactions are also subject to a protracted approval process involving the finance ministry. It can take 12 months and is often unsuccessful. In other words, many businesses are effectively held to ransom. Western firms are fighting back. Ariston\u2019s case was backed by major lobbying from the Italian Foreign Ministry. More companies are trying to attack through the legal system.\n\nGerman oil and gas producer Wintershall Dea has begun two arbitration proceedings against the Russian Federation after Putin signed decrees booting the company out of all of its five Russian joint ventures, including in the Nord Stream pipeline. Finnish energy company Fortum similarly initiated arbitration proceedings against Russia in February 2024 for compensation for unlawful seizure after it had its assets seized by presidential decree in 2023. \u201cFortum has since lost all oversight and control over the assets, and we are unaware of who runs these assets nor do we have any other information regarding the assets,\u201d says Esa Hyv\u00e4rinen, at Fortum. These tactics can be legally successful. In June 2024, German energy company Uniper won a $14 billion arbitration ruling against Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom. But there is a big difference between winning a court ruling and enforcing it.\n\n\u201cIt looks good, it sounds good, but in practice awards of that nature in the current environment are likely to be more symbolic in nature,\u201d says Massey. \u201cEnforcement and recovery are very challenging exercises in hostile circumstances.\u201d If Western businesses cannot get paid for businesses they have lost, would returning to Russia be a viable option? \u2018The presence of Western businesses in Russia and the kind of leverage that gives [Putin] over certain European countries has been one of the most useful tools in the Kremlin\u2019s toolbox for years.\u2019 Patrick Sewell of consultancy Control Risks There are still $US194 billion worth of foreign assets in Russia, and Trump has suggested he will give businesses the green light to resume operations there. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said in February there could be \u201cincredible opportunities\u201d for US business in Russia.\n\n\u201cAll the way up to the election of Donald Trump, companies were lining up to get approvals [to exit Russia],\u201d says Alan Kartashkin, who formerly ran the Moscow office of law firm Debevoise & Plimpton and now oversees its Eastern European business. Loading \u201cSo much has changed. Now, you have a US president saying we should develop economic ties with Russia and investors take notice. No leader in the Western world has said that since [Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in] February 2022.\u201d Hedge funds are exploring how they can make investments in the Russian stock market, he adds. \u201cThey want to place a bet on a potential peace deal.\u201d Sewell says other companies are looking at the feasibility of selling non-sanctioned goods, such as food, in Russia again.",

Got it Share\n\nHospitality entrepreneur Nathan Toleman has opened 24 venues over the past 20 years, but with his most recent restaurant, the Mulberry Group creative director (and partner in Lune Croissanterie) has experienced a rare failure. Molli, the restaurant the group opened in Abbotsford last June, will close on April 2 before reopening mid-April with a new concept and chef. Molli bistro-bar (left) and Little Molli cafe-deli will make way for new concepts. Tim Harris (left) and Kristoffer Paulsen \u201cWe missed the mark for creating an all-day neighbourhood venue,\u201d says Toleman. \u201cIt was a special-occasion place, not somewhere people raced back to. I had people who\u2019ve supported my venues for years say, \u2018I have to tell you this \u2026 I didn\u2019t love it.\u2019 In our own hearts, it just wasn\u2019t right.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make a business profitable from day one,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re okay with that if it\u2019s on the right track, but we weren\u2019t achieving the growth we wanted.\u201d One of Molli\u2019s open-faced sandwiches, topped with egg, greens and skordalia. Supplied\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncoming head chef Caitlin Koether, who\u2019s worked at San Francisco\u2019s Bar Tartine and Relae in Copenhagen, will serve wholesome dishes threaded with ferments, big flavours and striking colour palettes. All-day breakfast includes house-made yoghurt with sour cherry granola, while lunch will be built around open-faced sandwiches such as smoked chicken, chickpea miso mayonnaise and pickled celery. At night, bread and dips get a refresh: potato-based fry bread with whipped schmaltz, lemon thyme and chicken skin sounds like dinner unto itself. The menu continues with a chopped salad; roasted carrots with pickled persimmon; and steak aged with koji, the tenderising and flavour-giving Japanese ingredient. Carrots with pickled persimmons reflect new chef Caitlin Koether\u2019s wholesome style. Supplied \u201cI want people to feel nourished, and to be able to come in and have an entire meal without breaking the bank,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKoether came on board in October as head of fermentation, a job title she borrowed from a position she almost snared at Noma in Copenhagen in 2023. She\u2019s part of Molli\u2019s new all-women leadership team, which includes bar manager Kayla Saito (ex-Aru) and general manager Bonnie Maguire (ex-Falco). Head chef Caitlin Koether and venue manager Bonnie Maguire. Supplied Outgoing chef Aleksis Kalnins, who joined Mulberry Group in 2023 to helm Hazel, has departed the group and is considering offers. He puts Molli\u2019s troubles down to a mismatch between his cooking and the neighbourhood, which is known for pubs and bordered by Victoria Street\u2019s more casual dining. \u201cIf we opened on Flinders Lane, I think we would have done well.\u201d Toleman is still a Kalnins fan. \u201cThere\u2019s a football analogy: you have a great player, but you\u2019re playing him in the wrong position,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmitting the misfire on Molli 1.0 has been tough, but Toleman says he\u2019s open to learning. \u201cThe most successful people in business \u2013 Phil Knight from Nike, Richard Branson \u2013 have as many failures as successes. We don\u2019t talk about failure enough. Let\u2019s own it.\u201d The interior of Molli is being tweaked to suit the new all-day brief. Tim Harris The restaurant will aim for a softer look when reopens, with the stately antique credenzas replaced with more contemporary furnishings. Adjacent cafe Little Molli will stop operating on April 8 and reopen later in the month as a pantry selling Mulberry Made ferments. Cooking classes and workshops are planned, too. Molli reopens April 11. Breakfast and lunch daily; dinner Tue-Sat. 20 Mollison Street, Abbotsford, molliabbotsford.com.au\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

        "text": "Trump, of course, has touted the deal as a personal victory, while China\u2019s response characterises it as its loss. That raises question marks for both countries. Loading BlackRock and its co-investors, Global Infrastructure Partners (recently acquired by BlackRock) and Terminal Investment, a Swiss-based company owned by the Aponte shipping billionaire family, are Western, privately owned companies. Hutchison, a conglomerate with interests in ports, infrastructure (including gas pipeline networks in Australia), telecommunications (including a 25 per cent stake in TPG Telecom) and property around the world, is also, ostensibly, a privately owned, commercially driven group. It\u2019s regarded as the most successful company Hong Kong has produced.\n\nIf the deal is a win for Trump and the US, is the US president implying \u2013 as Beijing might believe \u2013that the consortium will prioritise the management of the ports in the economic and national security interests of the US over those of its investors? If the deal is contrary to China\u2019s national economic and security interests, as its response implies, does that mean it sees Hutchison\u2019s ownership or control of the ports as supportive of its strategic ambitions? For the US \u2013 and the other 22 countries that will need to consider the implications of the deal from their own perspectives \u2013 the BlackRock consortium can be expected to be driven by its own commercial considerations. Is Donald Trump suggesting that the buyers of the Panama Canal will manage its ports in the economic and national security interests of the US? Credit: AP Trump might want to attack China\u2019s dominance of global commercial shipping with massive increases in port fees and the rebuilding of a nearly non-existent US shipbuilding industry, but the consortium will be more interested in maximising the returns on a massive investment than in geopolitics. Even in Trump\u2019s America, businesses (other than, perhaps, Elon Musk\u2019s) prioritise profits above all else.\n\nFor China, blocking \u2013 or trying to block \u2013 the deal could suggest that it does see ownership of ports around the world as an important component of its geopolitical strategy and that even its private sector operators (Chinese state-owned companies are also major port operators) have been co-opted, or at least can be coerced to co-operate, with Beijing\u2019s ambitions. It would confirm Western suspicions. Ownership of ports and infrastructure around the world \u2013 particularly within the \u201cGlobal South\u201d countries, with which China has been steadily building relations and dependence via its \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative \u2013 is clearly an important part of China\u2019s strategy of gaining influence or control over critical points within global supply chains and its longer-term ambition of undermining America\u2019s global dominance. Opposing the Hutchison sale does, moreover, present some domestic risks for Beijing and China\u2019s economy. As China\u2019s economic growth has slowed and deflationary threats have emerged, Xi Jinping has shifted its stance on the private sector, which had previously been subjected to waves of crackdowns, regulation and intimidation. In February, Xi met China\u2019s leading entrepreneurs as a sign that they were back in favour and that he needed them to help re-energise China\u2019s faltering economic growth rate.\n\nFrustrating the Hutchison sale would signal to those entrepreneurs that the state support and the freedoms he was dangling before them to be entrepreneurial and profit-driven come with a caveat. They, and their fortunes, would still be subject to the whims of the state. More particularly, even after the handover of Hong Kong by the UK to China in 1997, China has tried to maintain a level of commercial independence for Hong Kong and its status as one of the world\u2019s key centres for finance and trade \u2013 although its response to the 2019 pro-democracy demonstrations, the controversial national security laws, placed a question mark over the extent of its tolerance. Loading Ordering or coercing Li and his family into abandoning the sale would send a chilling message to other Hong Kong entrepreneurs, privately held companies, and prospective investors in Hong Kong \u2013 and that at a time when foreign investors have, despite a concerted effort by the authorities, been fleeing mainland China. If Hong Kong is to remain a key global finance and trade hub, it can\u2019t send a signal that it will intervene in the affairs of multinationals, even those built by Hong Kong entrepreneurs.\n\nThere is some doubt whether China has much ability to intervene, other than through coercion. Hutchison has diplomatically retained ownership of its ports on the mainland and in Hong Kong, and while its property arm does have investments on the mainland, it has steadily reduced its exposure to Greater China over the decades. Only about 12 per cent of its revenue is generated within China and Hong Kong, with most of the rest flowing from Europe, North America and Australia. The $US19 billion of net cash it would get from the sale would be useful, given that it has announced a \u00a37 billion ($14.5 billion) bid for the UK\u2019s Thames Water and has also indicated it will return significant amounts to shareholders. It would also be timely. With Trump about to ramp up his trade war with the rest of the world with a new round of tariffs and having made it clear that China will face punitive port and shipping rates for its exports to America, global growth and global seaborne trade are likely to be adversely impacted.",

        "text": "Over the next few years, the Melbourne Arts Precinct plan will be rolled out, aimed at connecting the major creative institutes more. Among the changes, there will be a new gallery and a large garden. Loading The most significant change for the Arts Centre over the past two years is that the \u201cshort-term pain\u201d Quinlan described when I first spoke to her is here \u2013 the renovation of the State Theatre. Its closure last year has left a significant gap in the Melbourne performing arts landscape, with The Australian Ballet and Opera Australia essentially relocating to the Regent Theatre in the interim, creating knock-on effects as companies vie for space to stage productions. Quinlan says the refurbishment \u2013 due to finish in 2026 \u2013 is on schedule. As we tentatively start picking at our shared plates, each conscious to make sure that we both get to try the different kinds of sashimi, I bring up the last time we met \u2013 a few months ago, when we were taken on a tour of the works in progress. After navigating a maze of doors and beams and clutter we were told that we were standing on the stage. It had been difficult to believe. \u201cI know \u2013 you go in there and you don\u2019t even recognise it,\u201d says Quinlan with a small smile. \u201cYou can\u2019t even work out where you are because of all the scaffolding.\u201d\n\nOnce it\u2019s done, \u201cyou won\u2019t notice a visible difference \u2013 but you\u2019ll feel it,\u201d she says. The changes are quiet but necessary. \u201cAir conditioning, audio, seating, more aisles, more accessibility, new carpet, new chairs, seating \u2026 [and] a more efficient back of house\u201d, she lists. Karen Quinlan CEO Arts Centre Melbourne, Minister for Creative Industries Colin Brooks and local MP Nina Taylor in the construction site of the State Theatre in September 2024. Credit: Justin McManus In the meantime, she adds, the smaller Fairfax and Playhouse theatres are open, and \u201cWe have another little space called the showroom, which does new and emerging art, performing arts. So we\u2019re still active down there.\u201d One thing she has been pushing against in her now two years at the helm is how the Arts Centre is perceived. While she highlights the resident companies and programming with pride, she also underscores that \u201cin many ways, we\u2019re more than a hall for hire\u201d. The Arts Centre, she says, known for its live performances across the theatres buildings and the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, but hidden in its depths is a collection of artwork and of performing arts artefacts from across Victorian and Australian history \u2013 ranging from paintings by Arthur Boyd to Kylie Minogue\u2019s famed gold hot pants. \u201cOh, yeah, I think everyone\u2019s always interested in the hot pants,\u201d she says with an edge of amusement.\n\nOne of the newest pieces added to this collection is a photograph of David Hallberg, artistic director of The Australian Ballet, by Bill Henson. The image depicts a statuesque Hallberg looking out over the construction of the State Theatre. \u201cThat commission is a slightly new direction for us in terms of building upon what we already have as a collecting institution \u2013 which a lot of people don\u2019t know about,\u201d Quinlan reflects. \u201cThere are more than 850,000 items.\u201d Artistic Director of The Australian Ballet David Hallberg (left) with photographer Bill Henson with the work that Henson was commissioned to produce of Hallberg by Arts Centre Melbourne that will hang in the State Theatre foyer when it reopens. Credit: Justin McManus The shift from visual arts to performing arts is not the biggest one in her career. Quinlan started out teaching at an all-girls Catholic school, working with textiles. \u201cA lot of garment construction and fabric screen printing,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe course I did was very practical. It also had a very strong art history component.\u201d Over her few years there, her role changed and expanded into teaching art and media studies. \u201cIt was a good experience, and I loved education,\u201d she says. From there, however, she had a gear shift and a range of jobs \u2013 administration at the State Library and a position in the gallery shop at the NGV. As she became more interested in textiles and fashion at the gallery, she approached the curator to ask if she could do some voluntary work in the department. After a few years of volunteering, she began work as a curatorial assistant. \u201cI came into museums and galleries, in a non-traditional way, I suppose.\u201d She notices that I have stopped eating while listening, and ushers me to continue, serving us each a bit more.\n\nChef\u2019s special: Spanner crab on shokupan toast Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui There wasn\u2019t a set plan or strategy in her career pathway, though \u201cI was always fairly ambitious,\u201d she says. While at the NGV she applied for a course in conservation in London. \u201cBut then I had a change of heart and I decided I wouldn\u2019t go. You know how you have those moments in your career?\u201d she asks, looking off into the distance. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you have \u2013 where you contemplate a number of things? You finally work out what you want to do.\u201d It was during this period that a curator role came up in Bendigo, and that shaped the next 20 years of her life. In 2000, she took over as director and in her almost two decades at the helm, the gallery\u2019s ambition and reputation grew. They worked with the Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Portrait Gallery in London. \u201cWhen I was at Bendigo, I loved doing exhibitions that were about people and the stories, and, you know, Grace Kelly and Marilyn Monroe and I had a lot of grand plans. I brought fashion in. You know, you name it we did it,\u201d she reflects. \u201cIf you take a few risks and you have the community with you in a small place like Bendigo, that works, and it has worked, and it\u2019s still doing it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just got a great reputation now. So it is, yeah, I\u2019m very proud of the work I did up there.\u201d For her current role, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t think I was necessarily concerned about the fact that I was moving from visual arts to performing arts.\u201d But, would she have taken up the Arts Centre post if it weren\u2019t for the collection? She pauses, \u201cI always knew about the collection, and I always knew that it was not getting the attention that it should have. So probably not.\u201d\n\nKylie Minogue\u2019s shoes are one of over 850,000 items that make up the Arts Centre\u2019s performing arts collection. Credit: Justin McManus Only a few snippets of the personal weave their way into the conversation \u2013 Quinlan\u2019s laser-sharp focus is on her work and her plans as chief executive, but she does have one long-term side project that she lights up when she speaks about. Research into Australian artist Agnes Goodsir. It\u2019s an interest that has seen her digging through archives for several years. \u201cI like the process, and I love the discovery, and I\u2019m addicted to it.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know what final form this research will take, acknowledging that it is difficult to dedicate time to the project while working a demanding job.\n\nQuinlan is halfway through her five-year contract and has a lot of plans for the next few years. But she also has her eye on the future, both for herself and those following in her footsteps. She\u2019s not someone who never plans to retire. The bill at Sak\u00e9 Credit: \u201cIt\u2019s actually good thing to let younger people come in and take on \u2013 you can\u2019t hold on to these roles forever. I think with CEOs and director roles, it\u2019s good to see the movement,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I think about collecting institutions, curators stay with the collection, and they keep working. They\u2019ve got that lifelong contribution, and they\u2019ve got great knowledge. But I think when you\u2019re a CEO or a director, you can move a bit more, and I think you should.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019m fairly ambitious for every institution I\u2019ve ever worked for ...I won\u2019t be here forever, but I want to make sure what I do in the time that I am here is really as significant and maintains what this place is.\u201d",

        "text": "It may sound obvious, but Greenaway says one of the most important things to do if you\u2019re feeling disconnected is to speak up. Yet, many of us feel like we can\u2019t. In a report from not-for-profit Friends for Good, more than half of respondents said they would be embarrassed to tell someone they were feeling lonely, while only 29 per cent said they had opened up to someone about their loneliness. \u201cThere\u2019s this tendency to assume that social relationships are an inevitable part of life \u2013 they either work or they don\u2019t,\u201d says Greenaway. \u201cBut actually confronting that myth and saying, \u2018I know this isn\u2019t inevitable ... maybe I need to start verbalising some of these feelings and trying to do something about it.\u2019\u201d And as Greenaway points out, research shows people tend to react more positively than we think when we disclose hidden truths about ourselves and how we feel.\n\nMaking plans is a strategy often used by psychologists during Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Just as it sounds, it\u2019s about carving out time for things that bring us joy, align with our values or help get us closer to our short or long-term goals. As Greenaway points out, enriching our personal lives isn\u2019t just about having fun but is actually a must for our wellbeing. \u201cLooking after our social health isn\u2019t just a nice bonus. Ultimately, it ends up being a matter of life and death. It sounds quite extreme, but there\u2019s evidence to suggest being more socially connected actually has as strong or an even stronger effect on mortality than things like giving up smoking or drinking less.\u201d Quality over quantity The good news is there\u2019s no prescriptive model for what a healthy personal life should look like.\n\n\u201cWhat research shows is that quality matters more than quantity,\u201d says Greenaway. Some people may be completely fine with just seeing a few friends once a fortnight, while others will need more. Regardless, having some idea of what a meaningful social life looks like to you and a framework to help foster it is important. \u2018The brief chat with the barista is actually a pretty good antidote to isolation.\u2019 Professor Lisa Williams, UNSW \u201cIf you have some structure, it can make it easier to unthinkingly connect with others. You can set up your life and environment in a way where you\u2019re getting your social needs met. But if you have to think about going out when you need to, it might already be too late,\u201d she says. This could look like a regular fortnightly call with a friend or joining a local sport club.\n\nProfessor Lisa Williams, a social psychologist at UNSW, suggests a two-pronged approach to nurturing meaningful connections. The first, she says, is about engaging with deep relationships we already have and thinking about what we want from them. \u201cIs it sitting down and having a chat? Is it doing something you enjoy together that\u2019s meaningful to both of you?\u201d The second is about connecting with acquaintances or \u201cleaning into casual social connections\u201d. \u201cThe brief chat with the barista is actually a pretty good antidote to isolation,\u201d Williams says.\n\nSticking to a plan Scheduling activities is one thing, but actually following through on them can be tricky, particularly if you are feeling down. Loading But the act of making plans itself can be a powerful motivator. Williams says research on goal-setting shows that \u201cimplementation intentions\u201d increase the likelihood of us sticking to a plan.",

        "text": "Every now and then an athlete comes along who makes people wonder, \"How are they so fast?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nLet me introduce you to Gout Gout.\n\n\n\n\n\nGout is a 17-year-old sprint sensation from Australia, whose blistering 100m and 200m times have drawn comparison to none other than Jamaican sprint legend Usain Bolt.\n\n\n\nWhile he was edged out over 200 metres in Melbourne last weekend by 21-year-old Lachlan Kennedy \u2014 recent 60-metre world indoor silver medallist who is a rising sprinter poised to break the ten-second barrier for 100 metres \u2014 Gout\u2019s performances continue to signal a bright future on the track.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a seven-month period since last August, Gout has:\n\n\n\nWon silver in the 200m at the World Junior Championships (20.60 seconds, -0.7 metres/second wind)\n\nBroken Peter Norman\u2019s long-standing Australian 200m record (20.04 seconds, +1.5m/s)\n\nTwo weeks ago in Brisbane, smashed through the magical 20-second barrier for the 200m, recording a world-leading 19.98 seconds (+3.6m/s), albeit wind-aided (anything greater than 2.0 metres/second is considered wind-aided).\n\nBut what makes Gout so fast?\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it his explosive start, long stride, top speed or smooth technique?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe answer, as with all athletic outliers, is likely a combination of several unique attributes.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s dive into the science.\n\n\n\nThe science of sprinting\n\nSprinting is an ongoing battle of force and mass.\n\n\n\n\n\nGravity is pulling the athlete\u2019s body mass down. Meanwhile, the athlete must apply muscular force into the track to keep the body upright.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch suggests the world's fastest sprinters generate the highest ground reaction force relative to their body mass and apply it in the shortest period, in the right direction (more horizontally in acceleration and more vertically at top speed).\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 5'11\" (180cm) and 66kg, Gout does not display the muscular physiques of past champion sprinters including Asafa Powell (Jamaica), Justin Gatlin (the USA), or Australia\u2019s own Matt Shirvington.\n\n\n\n\n\nYet, his performances suggest he is redefining the archetype of elite sprinting.\n\n\n\nGout Gout of Australia celebrates winning the U18s, 100m final during the Australian All Schools Athletics Championships at Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre in Brisbane, 6 December, 2024. Source: AAP / Jono Searle For anyone who has run at school, you know the difficulty of holding your top speed for the duration of a 200-metre race.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Gout defies logic. His speed endurance (maintaining speed) sets him apart from nearly all athletes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd not just compared to his age group, although he currently sits second on the all-time under-18 200-metre list behind US runner Erriyon Knighton.\n\n\n\n\n\nGout\u2019s speed endurance is up there with the best in 200-metre history: Bolt, Michael Johnson or Noah Lyles. Each of them has won multiple Olympic medals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fastest official 100-200 metre segment (the final 100 metres of the race) ever run in a 200-metre event is 9.16 seconds by American Lyles, on his way to winning the 2022 world athletics championships in Oregon (19.31 seconds overall).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Gout\u2019s recent performance in Brisbane, he completed this segment of the race in 9.31 seconds. Bolt and Johnson\u2019s best 100-200 metre segment is 9.27 and 9.20 seconds, respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis statistic puts Gout in elite company.\n\n\n\nThe magic of Gout\n\nCloser analysis of Gout\u2019s performance highlights some sprinting anomalies.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe covers the first 100m of the race in 10.67 seconds, which is quite slow relative to his finishing time of 19.98.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison, when Bolt broke the 200-metre world record in 2009 (19.19 seconds), he ran 9.92 seconds on the curve (and 9.27 seconds on the straight).\n\n\n\n\n\nBut once Gout enters the straight, his magic is on full display.\n\n\n\n\n\nGout has an average step length of 2.60 metres. Bolt\u2019s average step length in his 100-metre world record performance was 2.45m, with Lyles displaying a similar result, 2.35m, in his 100-metre win in Paris.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis allows Gout to take between 3.75-4 steps for each ten-metre segment, which he covers at an average speed of 10.8m/s (or 38.8km/h). Like Bolt, his step length is a huge advantage over his competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, there is a trade-off with step length and step frequency.\n\n\n\nGout\u2019s longer-than-average step length reduces his average step frequency to 4.15Hz (steps per second), much lower than Bolt who averaged 4.47Hz when at his best.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, research highlights elite sprinters are reliant on either step length or frequency, and athletes should train to their strengths, rather than fixing their weaknesses.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo this may not be an area of concern for the teenager.\n\n\n\n\n\nGout also displays a unique coordination pattern in how he interacts with the ground: the way he strikes the track with his feet almost makes it look like he has springs in his spikes.\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, we all do in a sense.\n\n\n\n\n\nElastic energy is stored and released in our Achilles tendon which acts as a muscle power amplifier during running.\n\n\n\n\n\nLonger Achilles tendon length and stiffness play a huge role in sprint efficiency. This allows athletes to move at faster speeds for longer periods at a reduced energy cost, and may be another one\u2019s of Gout advantages over his contemporaries.\n\n\n\nA bright future\n\nAt 17, Gout\u2019s performances are out of this world.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe way he generates and maintains speed challenges some conventional paradigms in sprinting \u2014 namely that raw power and muscle mass are the primary determinants of speed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith most elite sprinters peaking in their mid-20s, Gout\u2019s performances at this stage of his career are even more noteworthy.\n\n\n\n\n\nHis success likely highlights the role of his unique coordination patterns, biomechanics, technical efficiency, hard work and great coaching all bundled together.\n\n\n\n\n\nGout has already rewritten Australian sprinting history. Next up, he's taking on the world.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Power bill relief is topping the election agenda, with both major parties claiming they will lower prices as they sell their vision for Australia's energy transition to voters.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, neither leader appears willing to put a figure on how much power bills will drop \u2014 nor how long it will take for their policies to achieve this effect.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has repeatedly labelled Labor's 2022 commitment to bring down power bills by $275 as a broken promise, given the rise in prices across the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance Minister Katy Gallagher defended Labor's performance on Monday, telling ABC's RN Breakfast that the policy announcement came before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine , which \"has impacted energy prices right around the world\".\n\n\n\nHover over the image to see what various politicians have said about Australia\u2019s energy transition. Source: SBS News This election, Labor is offering to continue rebates aimed at lowering power bills, while the Coalition claims nuclear and more gas is the pathway forward.\n\n\n\nWhat is the Coalition promising on power bills?\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton has promised to introduce an east coast domestic gas reserve, which would force exporters to set gas aside for use in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the plan would \"drive down\" wholesale domestic gas prices by decoupling them from the higher international prices that exported gas attracts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition's plan also includes fast-tracking new gas projects and halving approval times, including a pledge to approve the North West Shelf gas expansion in Western Australia within 30 days of being elected.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News \"There's no disputing the fact that if you put more supply into the market, that prices will come down,\" Dutton told reporters on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the Coalition has declined to provide an estimate for how much these policies would lower people's power bills.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition has also pledged to build nuclear power plants at an estimated cost of $331 billion \u2014 converting seven end-of-life coal-fired power plants into nuclear reactors .\n\n\n\n\n\nIt says the first reactor would be ready by 2035, five years sooner than the Commonwealth's science agency, CSIRO, says a plant could be built.\n\n\n\nLike Labor, the Coalition has pledged to achieve net-zero by 2050 but is yet to provide interim targets.\n\n\n\nWhat is Labor pledging on energy bills?\n\nCore to Labor's strategy is an 82 per cent renewable electricity target by 2030, achieving net zero by 2050.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe government has committed to building more than 4,000km of high-voltage transmission lines to carry renewable energy and connect the country's grid.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We have a 2030 target, we're confident we'll meet it, and our policy is very clear ... our policy is for renewables, backed with firming capacity of gas, batteries and hydro,\" Albanese said on Monday.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prime minister is also expected to announce subsidies for buying home batteries in the coming days, as reported by Nine newspapers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe policy will help households store surplus solar power generated during the day and combat the cost of peak-hour energy costs in the evening.\n\n\n\nThe grant amount remains unclear but home batteries are expected to save households roughly $1,000 on their annual power bill.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the short term, Labor has pledged that all Australian households and businesses will receive an extra $150 in energy bill relief if the government is re-elected.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan will see the rebates, paid in two $75 instalments over six months, extended until the end of 2025. It follows last year's $3.5 billion power bill sweetener, which offered $300 per household.\n\n\n\nWhat are the Greens proposing to combat energy prices?\n\nThe Greens oppose the expansion of gas projects and a nuclear industry in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe minor party supports the electrification of households and businesses, arguing it's the best way to reduce emissions and power bills.\n\n\n\nIn March, they proposed grants of up to $10,000 and low-interest loans of up to $20,000 to install technologies such as induction cooktops.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pitch included similar grants for installing solar batteries in households, which cost between $7,000 to $18,000, according to comparison site Solar Market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Getting homes off gas reduces pollution and helps bring down energy bills. It's good for your health and it's good for the environment,\" Greens leader Adam Bandt said.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's financial regulator has taken aim at a 4.1 trillion dollar superannuation industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chair of ASIC, Joe Longo, accusing providers of what he called widespread neglect of their customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is one of the most significant reports we have produced in my time at ASIC and it identifies a range of failings, including excessive delays and poor service when dealing with claims. Now, consider for a moment what this may mean for a person making a claim. When a beneficiary suffers delays in the processing of a death benefit, not only do they suffer the stress of having to engage with a complicated process while grieving, but they may be denied access to money they are entitled to, and which they may need to pay bills, ongoing living expenses, or even funeral costs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNew findings by ASIC show an overwhelming number of complaints by grieving Australians, related to poor customer service and excessive delays to death benefits.\n\n\n\n\n\nASIC Commissioner Simone Constant says super funds have failed to match the needs of their customers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Our review identified a range of problems including gaps in trustee data, reporting and metrics; none of the reviewed trustees monitored or reported on their end-to-end claims handling processes or performance; unclear and inconsistent processes and procedures; we found 78% of the claim files that we reviewed were delayed by processing issues within the trustees' control.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ten superannuation funds under review represent 38 percent of all member benefits in Australia... excluding two industry giants already facing legal proceedings over their handling of death and disability claims.\n\n\n\n\n\nASIC also found First Nations communities waited significantly longer for claims to be closed.. and that communication was often not culturally sensitive.\n\n\n\n\n\nIts report highlighted one case where a trustee took more than 500 days to pay a death benefit of around $100,000 to a First Nations woman grieving the loss of her husband.\n\n\n\n\n\nBettina Cooper is a senior financial counsellor with Mob Strong Debt Help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I can think of examples where people just give up. You can only try so hard to access something that is yours and you hit so many barriers before you stop trying. We know when we go out in community we actually have lines of people wanting to talk to us to help them access their money through super. For some First Nations people it is the only intergenerational wealth they'll ever have. First Nations people still have a gap, and that gap is about building generational wealth. Superannuation should be filling that gap.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving barriers for First Nations claimants was among ASIC's 34 recommendations in its report.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvocates like Bettina Cooper say it's past time for change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We've been working with banks for years on making money accessible for First Nations people and making the process accessible. Superannuation funds are still back at the starting line. It is time for us to have mandatory legislated minimum standards of service, and those services need to include First Nations people and need to include fair and reasonable access, timely claims, and the ability for people to be able to do this with dignity and respect.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMary Delahunty is the Chief Executive of the peak industry body, the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the report is sobering reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We note the really deep and good work the regulator has done to help us improve, really over the last year, the service standards, particularly in death benefits claims' handling time, but it's not an easy read and we are really sorry for all the stress that has been caused.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's a packed house in this quaint mosque.\n\n\n\n\n\nHundreds of Muslims squeeze in for a spot to pray celebrating Eid al-Fitr.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, on the south-western slopes of New South Wales, a thriving Muslim community has found comfort in calling the town of Young home.\n\n\n\n\n\nSporting a population of around 10,000, Young is 372 kilometres west-south-west of Sydney, and known for its rich cherry-growing heritage.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeading the prayers at the mosque is Imam Emad Hamdy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The beauty of Eid is you are seeing a big number of people who are coming from different backgrounds and they are all Muslims.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Omar Kowaider and Joanna Bryla, Eid is still rooted in special traditions, as they hand gifts to their two young children.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Ms Bryla says it's a little slower paced since they moved here from Sydney three years ago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There was no sense of camaraderie or community. There was no warmth anymore. Young was a way to escape that, to feel a bit of freedom.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Kowaider says, together, they found peace in open space and a stronger connection to faith.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I believe Young, not just Young, but I guess any kind of rural community brings out the best in you. And I think it definitely lets the soul search and gives it that yearning of coming back to where we belong and being closer to God.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThey\u2019re one of hundreds, mainly hailing from Lebanon, who've ditched the major capitals for this rural life, mostly in the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the first Muslim families who arrived here date back to the late 1980s.\n\n\n\n\n\nBassem Ali's parents and uncle are described as the so-called Muslim forefathers of this town.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of settling in Sydney, Mr Ali says they opted for a lifestyle that resembled their roots in the villages of northern Lebanon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"My parents came from a farming family anyway, and my uncle, they had orange orchards in Lebanon and they were vegetable growers in Lebanon.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, their descendants roam their acreage.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour decades later, Arabic has become the second most spoken language here after English, and it's thought one in every ten people are Muslim.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mayor of Young is Brian Ingram.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says the contributions of these people to the town have been invaluable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They just jump in every time with donations and time and thousands and thousands worth dollars worth of contribution. They don't put it out there to highlight it. They don't do it for that. They do it because they care. And that's part of becoming a big part of our community.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nRight across the Ali family farm, is believed to be just one of the drawcards for moving here- the small, local mosque.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt opened in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdullah Sultan is the head of committee at Young Mosque, which is managed by the Lebanese Muslim Association.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's far away. It's away from the public, it's away from the city is there's a mosque, there's a small community there. Just by me saying that to you, you want to move here, you know what I mean?\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as the community got bigger, a desire arose to build a new space with enough room for everyone to pray in.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, last year, construction began for a new mosque that\u2019s nearly five times bigger than where they currently pray, and can fit more than 1,000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Sultan says it is a symbol of the community\u2019s growth for generations to come.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"A magnificent place of worship like this is going to attract more people to our town, increase that pool of potential and create opportunity for our children.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, nearly forty years after his relatives moved here, Mr Ali heartily agrees.\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "As Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition leader Peter Dutton ramp up their election campaigns, the cost of living has emerged as a key election issue.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cost of groceries has been a particular focus of attention and was the subject of a year-long inquiry carried out by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe inquiry examined pricing practices, profit margins, and Coles' and Woolworths' power in the industry.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn its report, the ACCC did not find any evidence of price gouging.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE What Labor's proposed price gouging ban could mean for your grocery bill\n\nDespite this, Albanese announced on Sunday that if re-elected, Labor will introduce legislation to make price gouging illegal.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, Dutton has suggested the Coalition would enforce supermarket divestiture powers to address anti-competitive behaviour.\n\n\n\nSupermarkets respond to price gouging accusations\n\nColes and Woolworths have repeatedly rejected claims of price gouging, despite prices rising 24 per cent in the last five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement released on Sunday, a Coles spokesperson said these prices largely reflected the increased cost of doing business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What's needed are measures that tackle the real factors driving higher grocery prices, which are rising costs such as energy, fuel, labour, insurance, production, freight and distribution,\" they said.\n\n\n\nWoolworths has rejected claims of price gouging. Source: AAP / Darren England A Woolworths Group spokesperson said the organisation had provided thousands of documents and millions of data points to the supermarket inquiry to explain how economy-wide inflation is impacting suppliers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We recognise our customers have experienced several years of significant inflation, with an escalation in the cost of mortgages, rent, transport, insurance, energy, food and many other household essentials.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the spokesperson, Woolworths Group has already taken action on many of the ACCC report\u2019s recommendations to improve the experience and transparency for customers and suppliers.\n\n\n\nLabor's plan to ban price gouging\n\nWhile the ACCC found Australian supermarkets are among the most profitable globally, the supermarket giants have argued their profit margins are comparable to their peers in countries including Canada, the UK and the US.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaws to protect customers from companies engaging in price gouging already exist in the UK, European Union and dozens of states in the US.\n\n\n\nAlbanese said that if Labor wins the 3 May federal election, Labor would introduce similar laws in Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We will introduce legislation making price gouging illegal by the end of this year,\" he said on ABC's Insiders program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What we want to make sure is that they (supermarkets) know that they're being watched. They know that the government is prepared to take strong action and crack down.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance Minister Katy Gallagher said price gouging laws are a \"missing part\" of Australia's competition laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"We think that this is something that\u2019s worked overseas, it\u2019s in place overseas, and this is another tool in the toolkit for the ACCC to cover off concerns around excessive prices in supermarkets,\" she told ABC Radio National Breakfast on Monday.\n\n\n\nWhile Gallagher acknowledged the supermarket inquiry did not find any evidence of price gouging, she said it had found examples of prices increasing considerably, and it also highlighted the increasing market share of major supermarkets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I wouldn\u2019t say that the ACCC report gave the supermarkets a clean bill of health, I don\u2019t think it did that at all,\" she said.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecific details of the government policy \u2014 including how it would determine price gouging \u2014 have not yet been released.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Coles and Woolworths sued by ACCC over allegedly misleading discount claims\n\nA task force would be set up to advise on introducing an excessive-pricing regime for supermarkets to be policed by the consumer watchdog.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe group would include Treasury, the consumer watchdog and other experts who would consult and report to the federal government within six months.\n\n\n\nAre supermarkets being unfairly targeted?\n\nThe ACCC report is not the only investigation into supermarket price gouging.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Australian Council of Trade Unions, a Senate select committee, an independent review for Treasury and state parliamentary inquiries in Queensland and South Australia have all examined the practice of price gouging.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile some claim it does exist in the supermarket sector, others have found no evidence.\n\n\n\nProfessor Gary Mortimer, professor of marketing and consumer behaviour at the Queensland University of Technology Business School, said he believes supermarkets are being unfairly targeted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's disappointing that both political parties \u2014 and I would include the Greens here \u2014 have decided to focus on supermarkets rather than the more significant and complex social and economic issues facing the Australian public,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When you're a minister and you are facing issues such as youth crime, housing crisis, rental crisis, hospital ramping, a teacher shortage \u2014 those issues are significantly [more] challenging to fix \u2014 so it's easier to apply [a] distraction strategy and focus on the price of a chocolate bar. It gets better cut through.\"\n\n\n\nMortimer said he believes rising costs of supermarket goods are largely due to the supermarkets' 'input costs' (costs incurred to make a product) and paying more for fuel and freight, wholesale goods, wages, and licences.\n\n\n\n\n\nLaws against price gouging would be unlikely to impact grocery prices or help shoppers unless these costs are addressed, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They can certainly put legislation in place to outlaw price gouging, but if price gouging is not happening, no penalties will be awarded and it won't actually bring prices down,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"What will bring prices down is a lower corporate tax rate, field subsidies, less red tape, less bureaucracy, less input costs.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 with additional reporting from the Australian Associated Press\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The financial watchdog says the superannuation industry needs to do better after a review they undertook found that, in more than three-quarters of death benefit claims, super funds were responsible for delays caused by processing issues within their control.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeath benefits refer to the remaining superannuation balance in a member's account after they pass away, which a beneficiary \u2014 usually a family member \u2014 is entitled to be paid as soon as practicable.\n\n\n\nWhat did ASIC's report find?\n\nThe Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) said poor customer service was rife among the 10 trustees they reviewed, which cover about 38 per cent of benefits held by funds regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trustees included a mix of retail, public sector and industry super funds, including Australian Retirement Trust and UniSuper. It did not include Cbus or AustralianSuper in its review because it has already initiated legal proceedings against them.\n\n\n\nExcessive delays and poor service\n\nASIC found many examples of excessive delays and poor service. While timelines to respond to claims varied greatly between funds, none of them closed more than half of the claims within 90 days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Of the claim files ASIC reviewed, 78 per cent involved delays caused by processing issues within the trustee's control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Timeliness varied from Colonial First State trustee Avanteos, which closed approximately 48 per cent of death benefit claims in 90 days, to the slowest trustee, Rest, which closed only 8 per cent of claims in the same period of time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 Instances of poor customer service were present in 27 per cent of claim files, including not returning claimants' phone calls, dismissing their queries and asking for unreasonable information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2014 In one case, a trustee took over 500 days to pay a death benefit of around $100,000 to a First Nations woman grieving the loss of her husband.\n\n\n\nWhat has ASIC said about the findings?\n\n\"Many of the complaints we read were distressing. We saw deep grief, vulnerability, frustration and genuine suffering.\" \u2014 Simone Constant, ASIC commissioner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The money from a death benefit can make a huge difference and each day a trustee delays that payment causes real harm to families.\"\n\n\n\nWhat did ASIC recommend?\n\nThe report made 34 recommendations for funds to adopt.

        "text": "Such neck-twisting turns have become routine for the US stock market recently because of uncertainty about what Trump will do with tariffs \u2014 and by how much they will worsen inflation and grind down growth for economies. Wall Street\u2019s swings followed a sell-off that spanned the world earlier on Monday as worries built about the effects of the tariffs that Trump says will bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States. \u201cThe best way to summarize this trading environment is frustration and fatigue,\u201d said Joe Gilbert, a portfolio manager at Integrity Asset Management. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have a clear playbook on how to proceed.\u201d In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index dropped 4 per cent. South Korea\u2019s Kospi sank 3 per cent, and France\u2019s CAC 40 fell 1.6 per cent. Instead of stocks, prices strengthened for things considered safer bets when the economy is looking shaky. Gold rose again to briefly crest $3160 per ounce. Prices for US Treasury bonds also climbed, which in turn sent their yields down. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.21 per cent from 4.27 per cent late Friday and from roughly 4.80 per cent in January.\n\nOn Wednesday, the United States is set to begin what Trump calls \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, which will be tailored to match what he sees is the burden each country places on his, including things like value-added taxes. Much is still unknown, including exactly what the US government will do on \u201cLiberation Day\u201d. At Goldman Sachs, economists expect Trump to announce an average 15 per cent reciprocal tariff. They also raised their forecast for inflation and lowered it for US economic growth for the end of the year. Loading They now see a 35 per cent chance of recession in the next year, up from an earlier forecast of 20 per cent, \u201creflecting our lower growth forecast, falling confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating willingness to tolerate economic pain,\u201d according to Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle. If the April 2 tariffs end up being less onerous than investors fear \u2014 maybe Trump includes no additional tariff increases on China, for example \u2014 stocks could rally. But if they end up being a worst-case scenario, which gets businesses so fearful that they start cutting their workforces, stocks could sink much further.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also the chance that April 2 does little to clear the uncertainty. It could end up being a \u201cstepping stone for further negotiations\u201d instead of a \u201cclearing event\u201d for the market, according to Michael Wilson and other strategists at Morgan Stanley. \u201cThis means policy uncertainty and growth risks are likely to persist \u2014 it\u2019s a question of to what degree,\u201d Wilson wrote in a report. One worry is that even if Trump\u2019s tariffs end up being less harsh than feared, all the uncertainty created by them alone could cause US households and businesses to freeze their spending, which would hurt an economy that had been running at a solid pace to close last year. Either way, some familiar names were among Wall Street\u2019s hardest hit on Monday. Tesla fell 1.7 per cent to bring its loss for the year so far to 35.8 per cent. It\u2019s been one of the year\u2019s worst performers in the S&P 500 in large part because of fears that the electric-vehicle maker\u2019s brand has become too intertwined with its CEO, Elon Musk.\n\nMusk has been leading US government efforts to cut spending, making him a target of growing political anger, and protests have swarmed Tesla showrooms as a result. Other Big Tech stocks also struggled. They\u2019ve been at the sell-off\u2019s centre in large part because of criticism that their stock prices had become too expensive. Critics pointed to how their prices rose faster than their already quick-growing profits in recent years. Nvidia, which has ridden the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology to become one of Wall Street\u2019s most influential stocks, fell 1.2 per cent to bring its loss for the year so far to 19.3 per cent. On the winning side of Wall Street, Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway rose 1.2 per cent and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. The parent of GEICO and other companies said earlier this year it\u2019s sitting on $334.2 billion in unused cash. Such a large amount could indicate Buffett, who\u2019s famous for buying when prices are low, may see little worth purchasing in a stock market that critics had called too expensive. with AP/Bloomberg",

        "text": "Now, however, the chances of a return to Russia \u2013 if not the extraction of proper payment for stolen assets \u2013 has risen with Donald Trump in the White House and new messaging from US officials about reopening economic ties with Russia. Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, said last month he expected \u201ca number of American companies will return to the Russian market as early as in the second quarter of the year\u201d. Some Western businesses have already laid the groundwork to return. French carmaker Renault sold all of its shares in Renault Russia and its 67.69 per cent interest in Russia\u2019s AvtoVAZ in May 2022, but this agreement includes an option for Renault to buy back its interest in AvtoVAZ that is exercisable for six years. Luca de Meo, the Renault chief, last month refused to rule out a return to Russia. However, officials have since said the carmaker would need to pay $US1.3 billion to do so.\n\nExecutives should also be wary: analysts warn that Putin is using Western businesses as a pawn in his games with Europe and the US. Lost Western assets and cash have become a bargaining chip in negotiations over a potential peace deal on Ukraine \u2013 and a way of dividing Europe. Renault chief Luca de Meo has refused to rule out a return to Russia. Credit: Bloomberg \u201cAs sanctions have proliferated, the Kremlin has increasingly come to the view that Russian assets of multinational firms are useful collateral for frozen assets abroad,\u201d says Ian Massey, at S-RM consultants. Europe and the US have frozen some $US300 billion in Russia\u2019s overseas assets, something that has irked the Kremlin. Austria\u2019s Raiffeisen Bank International (RBI) is battling a \u20ac2 billion ($3.4 billion) fine imposed by a Russian court in January, which officials said was compensation for frozen assets in Austria. \u201cWe had only 10 minutes to make our case in court,\u201d says RBI spokesperson Christof Danz. The defendant was flanked by armed people wearing balaclavas. RBI is appealing the ruling and has its next court hearing on April 24.\n\n\u201cThe presence of Western businesses in Russia and the kind of leverage that gives [Putin] over certain European countries has been one of the most useful tools in the Kremlin\u2019s toolbox for years,\u201d says Patrick Sewell, of Control Risks, a consultancy. Loading With the Ariston decision, Putin may also be trying to divide Europe by signalling that countries that take a softer line to Moscow may get their assets back, he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite plausible that Putin would be happy to allow certain Western companies to take back their assets in a way that drives a wedge between different members of the EU. \u201cItaly has sometimes been a kind of soft target for Russia. They\u2019ve typically been among the more Russian friendly-countries of the EU, the Italian business community has always been very active in Moscow.\u201d\n\nPutin\u2019s response to the tidal wave of Western sanctions that hit Russia after the war began was a vicious attack on foreign businesses operating in the state. Of the $US167 billion lost since 2022, $US57 billion has been lost by 30 companies who have had their assets forcibly seized, according to the KSE Institute. These included French yoghurt maker Danone and Danish brewer Carlsberg, both of which have since sold their Russian assets and cut their losses. Putin also imposed blocks on companies trying to escape. Until last autumn, businesses selling assets in Russia had to take a 50 per cent hit on the sale price and pay an exit tax on the proceeds of 15 per cent. In October, Russia raised the discount to 60 per cent and the exit fee to 35 per cent. Transactions are also subject to a protracted approval process involving the finance ministry. It can take 12 months and is often unsuccessful. In other words, many businesses are effectively held to ransom. Western firms are fighting back. Ariston\u2019s case was backed by major lobbying from the Italian Foreign Ministry. More companies are trying to attack through the legal system.\n\nGerman oil and gas producer Wintershall Dea has begun two arbitration proceedings against the Russian Federation after Putin signed decrees booting the company out of all of its five Russian joint ventures, including in the Nord Stream pipeline. Finnish energy company Fortum similarly initiated arbitration proceedings against Russia in February 2024 for compensation for unlawful seizure after it had its assets seized by presidential decree in 2023. \u201cFortum has since lost all oversight and control over the assets, and we are unaware of who runs these assets nor do we have any other information regarding the assets,\u201d says Esa Hyv\u00e4rinen, at Fortum. These tactics can be legally successful. In June 2024, German energy company Uniper won a $14 billion arbitration ruling against Russia\u2019s state-owned energy giant Gazprom. But there is a big difference between winning a court ruling and enforcing it.\n\n\u201cIt looks good, it sounds good, but in practice awards of that nature in the current environment are likely to be more symbolic in nature,\u201d says Massey. \u201cEnforcement and recovery are very challenging exercises in hostile circumstances.\u201d If Western businesses cannot get paid for businesses they have lost, would returning to Russia be a viable option? \u2018The presence of Western businesses in Russia and the kind of leverage that gives [Putin] over certain European countries has been one of the most useful tools in the Kremlin\u2019s toolbox for years.\u2019 Patrick Sewell of consultancy Control Risks There are still $US194 billion worth of foreign assets in Russia, and Trump has suggested he will give businesses the green light to resume operations there. Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said in February there could be \u201cincredible opportunities\u201d for US business in Russia.\n\n\u201cAll the way up to the election of Donald Trump, companies were lining up to get approvals [to exit Russia],\u201d says Alan Kartashkin, who formerly ran the Moscow office of law firm Debevoise & Plimpton and now oversees its Eastern European business. Loading \u201cSo much has changed. Now, you have a US president saying we should develop economic ties with Russia and investors take notice. No leader in the Western world has said that since [Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in] February 2022.\u201d Hedge funds are exploring how they can make investments in the Russian stock market, he adds. \u201cThey want to place a bet on a potential peace deal.\u201d Sewell says other companies are looking at the feasibility of selling non-sanctioned goods, such as food, in Russia again.",

Got it Share\n\nHospitality entrepreneur Nathan Toleman has opened 24 venues over the past 20 years, but with his most recent restaurant, the Mulberry Group creative director (and partner in Lune Croissanterie) has experienced a rare failure. Molli, the restaurant the group opened in Abbotsford last June, will close on April 2 before reopening mid-April with a new concept and chef. Molli bistro-bar (left) and Little Molli cafe-deli will make way for new concepts. Tim Harris (left) and Kristoffer Paulsen \u201cWe missed the mark for creating an all-day neighbourhood venue,\u201d says Toleman. \u201cIt was a special-occasion place, not somewhere people raced back to. I had people who\u2019ve supported my venues for years say, \u2018I have to tell you this \u2026 I didn\u2019t love it.\u2019 In our own hearts, it just wasn\u2019t right.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hard to make a business profitable from day one,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re okay with that if it\u2019s on the right track, but we weren\u2019t achieving the growth we wanted.\u201d One of Molli\u2019s open-faced sandwiches, topped with egg, greens and skordalia. Supplied\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncoming head chef Caitlin Koether, who\u2019s worked at San Francisco\u2019s Bar Tartine and Relae in Copenhagen, will serve wholesome dishes threaded with ferments, big flavours and striking colour palettes. All-day breakfast includes house-made yoghurt with sour cherry granola, while lunch will be built around open-faced sandwiches such as smoked chicken, chickpea miso mayonnaise and pickled celery. At night, bread and dips get a refresh: potato-based fry bread with whipped schmaltz, lemon thyme and chicken skin sounds like dinner unto itself. The menu continues with a chopped salad; roasted carrots with pickled persimmon; and steak aged with koji, the tenderising and flavour-giving Japanese ingredient. Carrots with pickled persimmons reflect new chef Caitlin Koether\u2019s wholesome style. Supplied \u201cI want people to feel nourished, and to be able to come in and have an entire meal without breaking the bank,\u201d she says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKoether came on board in October as head of fermentation, a job title she borrowed from a position she almost snared at Noma in Copenhagen in 2023. She\u2019s part of Molli\u2019s new all-women leadership team, which includes bar manager Kayla Saito (ex-Aru) and general manager Bonnie Maguire (ex-Falco). Head chef Caitlin Koether and venue manager Bonnie Maguire. Supplied Outgoing chef Aleksis Kalnins, who joined Mulberry Group in 2023 to helm Hazel, has departed the group and is considering offers. He puts Molli\u2019s troubles down to a mismatch between his cooking and the neighbourhood, which is known for pubs and bordered by Victoria Street\u2019s more casual dining. \u201cIf we opened on Flinders Lane, I think we would have done well.\u201d Toleman is still a Kalnins fan. \u201cThere\u2019s a football analogy: you have a great player, but you\u2019re playing him in the wrong position,\u201d he says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdmitting the misfire on Molli 1.0 has been tough, but Toleman says he\u2019s open to learning. \u201cThe most successful people in business \u2013 Phil Knight from Nike, Richard Branson \u2013 have as many failures as successes. We don\u2019t talk about failure enough. Let\u2019s own it.\u201d The interior of Molli is being tweaked to suit the new all-day brief. Tim Harris The restaurant will aim for a softer look when reopens, with the stately antique credenzas replaced with more contemporary furnishings. Adjacent cafe Little Molli will stop operating on April 8 and reopen later in the month as a pantry selling Mulberry Made ferments. Cooking classes and workshops are planned, too. Molli reopens April 11. Breakfast and lunch daily; dinner Tue-Sat. 20 Mollison Street, Abbotsford, molliabbotsford.com.au\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

        "text": "Trump, of course, has touted the deal as a personal victory, while China\u2019s response characterises it as its loss. That raises question marks for both countries. Loading BlackRock and its co-investors, Global Infrastructure Partners (recently acquired by BlackRock) and Terminal Investment, a Swiss-based company owned by the Aponte shipping billionaire family, are Western, privately owned companies. Hutchison, a conglomerate with interests in ports, infrastructure (including gas pipeline networks in Australia), telecommunications (including a 25 per cent stake in TPG Telecom) and property around the world, is also, ostensibly, a privately owned, commercially driven group. It\u2019s regarded as the most successful company Hong Kong has produced.\n\nIf the deal is a win for Trump and the US, is the US president implying \u2013 as Beijing might believe \u2013that the consortium will prioritise the management of the ports in the economic and national security interests of the US over those of its investors? If the deal is contrary to China\u2019s national economic and security interests, as its response implies, does that mean it sees Hutchison\u2019s ownership or control of the ports as supportive of its strategic ambitions? For the US \u2013 and the other 22 countries that will need to consider the implications of the deal from their own perspectives \u2013 the BlackRock consortium can be expected to be driven by its own commercial considerations. Is Donald Trump suggesting that the buyers of the Panama Canal will manage its ports in the economic and national security interests of the US? Credit: AP Trump might want to attack China\u2019s dominance of global commercial shipping with massive increases in port fees and the rebuilding of a nearly non-existent US shipbuilding industry, but the consortium will be more interested in maximising the returns on a massive investment than in geopolitics. Even in Trump\u2019s America, businesses (other than, perhaps, Elon Musk\u2019s) prioritise profits above all else.\n\nFor China, blocking \u2013 or trying to block \u2013 the deal could suggest that it does see ownership of ports around the world as an important component of its geopolitical strategy and that even its private sector operators (Chinese state-owned companies are also major port operators) have been co-opted, or at least can be coerced to co-operate, with Beijing\u2019s ambitions. It would confirm Western suspicions. Ownership of ports and infrastructure around the world \u2013 particularly within the \u201cGlobal South\u201d countries, with which China has been steadily building relations and dependence via its \u201cBelt and Road\u201d initiative \u2013 is clearly an important part of China\u2019s strategy of gaining influence or control over critical points within global supply chains and its longer-term ambition of undermining America\u2019s global dominance. Opposing the Hutchison sale does, moreover, present some domestic risks for Beijing and China\u2019s economy. As China\u2019s economic growth has slowed and deflationary threats have emerged, Xi Jinping has shifted its stance on the private sector, which had previously been subjected to waves of crackdowns, regulation and intimidation. In February, Xi met China\u2019s leading entrepreneurs as a sign that they were back in favour and that he needed them to help re-energise China\u2019s faltering economic growth rate.\n\nFrustrating the Hutchison sale would signal to those entrepreneurs that the state support and the freedoms he was dangling before them to be entrepreneurial and profit-driven come with a caveat. They, and their fortunes, would still be subject to the whims of the state. More particularly, even after the handover of Hong Kong by the UK to China in 1997, China has tried to maintain a level of commercial independence for Hong Kong and its status as one of the world\u2019s key centres for finance and trade \u2013 although its response to the 2019 pro-democracy demonstrations, the controversial national security laws, placed a question mark over the extent of its tolerance. Loading Ordering or coercing Li and his family into abandoning the sale would send a chilling message to other Hong Kong entrepreneurs, privately held companies, and prospective investors in Hong Kong \u2013 and that at a time when foreign investors have, despite a concerted effort by the authorities, been fleeing mainland China. If Hong Kong is to remain a key global finance and trade hub, it can\u2019t send a signal that it will intervene in the affairs of multinationals, even those built by Hong Kong entrepreneurs.\n\nThere is some doubt whether China has much ability to intervene, other than through coercion. Hutchison has diplomatically retained ownership of its ports on the mainland and in Hong Kong, and while its property arm does have investments on the mainland, it has steadily reduced its exposure to Greater China over the decades. Only about 12 per cent of its revenue is generated within China and Hong Kong, with most of the rest flowing from Europe, North America and Australia. The $US19 billion of net cash it would get from the sale would be useful, given that it has announced a \u00a37 billion ($14.5 billion) bid for the UK\u2019s Thames Water and has also indicated it will return significant amounts to shareholders. It would also be timely. With Trump about to ramp up his trade war with the rest of the world with a new round of tariffs and having made it clear that China will face punitive port and shipping rates for its exports to America, global growth and global seaborne trade are likely to be adversely impacted.",

        "text": "Over the next few years, the Melbourne Arts Precinct plan will be rolled out, aimed at connecting the major creative institutes more. Among the changes, there will be a new gallery and a large garden. Loading The most significant change for the Arts Centre over the past two years is that the \u201cshort-term pain\u201d Quinlan described when I first spoke to her is here \u2013 the renovation of the State Theatre. Its closure last year has left a significant gap in the Melbourne performing arts landscape, with The Australian Ballet and Opera Australia essentially relocating to the Regent Theatre in the interim, creating knock-on effects as companies vie for space to stage productions. Quinlan says the refurbishment \u2013 due to finish in 2026 \u2013 is on schedule. As we tentatively start picking at our shared plates, each conscious to make sure that we both get to try the different kinds of sashimi, I bring up the last time we met \u2013 a few months ago, when we were taken on a tour of the works in progress. After navigating a maze of doors and beams and clutter we were told that we were standing on the stage. It had been difficult to believe. \u201cI know \u2013 you go in there and you don\u2019t even recognise it,\u201d says Quinlan with a small smile. \u201cYou can\u2019t even work out where you are because of all the scaffolding.\u201d\n\nOnce it\u2019s done, \u201cyou won\u2019t notice a visible difference \u2013 but you\u2019ll feel it,\u201d she says. The changes are quiet but necessary. \u201cAir conditioning, audio, seating, more aisles, more accessibility, new carpet, new chairs, seating \u2026 [and] a more efficient back of house\u201d, she lists. Karen Quinlan CEO Arts Centre Melbourne, Minister for Creative Industries Colin Brooks and local MP Nina Taylor in the construction site of the State Theatre in September 2024. Credit: Justin McManus In the meantime, she adds, the smaller Fairfax and Playhouse theatres are open, and \u201cWe have another little space called the showroom, which does new and emerging art, performing arts. So we\u2019re still active down there.\u201d One thing she has been pushing against in her now two years at the helm is how the Arts Centre is perceived. While she highlights the resident companies and programming with pride, she also underscores that \u201cin many ways, we\u2019re more than a hall for hire\u201d. The Arts Centre, she says, known for its live performances across the theatres buildings and the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, but hidden in its depths is a collection of artwork and of performing arts artefacts from across Victorian and Australian history \u2013 ranging from paintings by Arthur Boyd to Kylie Minogue\u2019s famed gold hot pants. \u201cOh, yeah, I think everyone\u2019s always interested in the hot pants,\u201d she says with an edge of amusement.\n\nOne of the newest pieces added to this collection is a photograph of David Hallberg, artistic director of The Australian Ballet, by Bill Henson. The image depicts a statuesque Hallberg looking out over the construction of the State Theatre. \u201cThat commission is a slightly new direction for us in terms of building upon what we already have as a collecting institution \u2013 which a lot of people don\u2019t know about,\u201d Quinlan reflects. \u201cThere are more than 850,000 items.\u201d Artistic Director of The Australian Ballet David Hallberg (left) with photographer Bill Henson with the work that Henson was commissioned to produce of Hallberg by Arts Centre Melbourne that will hang in the State Theatre foyer when it reopens. Credit: Justin McManus The shift from visual arts to performing arts is not the biggest one in her career. Quinlan started out teaching at an all-girls Catholic school, working with textiles. \u201cA lot of garment construction and fabric screen printing,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe course I did was very practical. It also had a very strong art history component.\u201d Over her few years there, her role changed and expanded into teaching art and media studies. \u201cIt was a good experience, and I loved education,\u201d she says. From there, however, she had a gear shift and a range of jobs \u2013 administration at the State Library and a position in the gallery shop at the NGV. As she became more interested in textiles and fashion at the gallery, she approached the curator to ask if she could do some voluntary work in the department. After a few years of volunteering, she began work as a curatorial assistant. \u201cI came into museums and galleries, in a non-traditional way, I suppose.\u201d She notices that I have stopped eating while listening, and ushers me to continue, serving us each a bit more.\n\nChef\u2019s special: Spanner crab on shokupan toast Credit: Luis Enrique Ascui There wasn\u2019t a set plan or strategy in her career pathway, though \u201cI was always fairly ambitious,\u201d she says. While at the NGV she applied for a course in conservation in London. \u201cBut then I had a change of heart and I decided I wouldn\u2019t go. You know how you have those moments in your career?\u201d she asks, looking off into the distance. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you have \u2013 where you contemplate a number of things? You finally work out what you want to do.\u201d It was during this period that a curator role came up in Bendigo, and that shaped the next 20 years of her life. In 2000, she took over as director and in her almost two decades at the helm, the gallery\u2019s ambition and reputation grew. They worked with the Victoria and Albert Museum and the National Portrait Gallery in London. \u201cWhen I was at Bendigo, I loved doing exhibitions that were about people and the stories, and, you know, Grace Kelly and Marilyn Monroe and I had a lot of grand plans. I brought fashion in. You know, you name it we did it,\u201d she reflects. \u201cIf you take a few risks and you have the community with you in a small place like Bendigo, that works, and it has worked, and it\u2019s still doing it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just got a great reputation now. So it is, yeah, I\u2019m very proud of the work I did up there.\u201d For her current role, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t think I was necessarily concerned about the fact that I was moving from visual arts to performing arts.\u201d But, would she have taken up the Arts Centre post if it weren\u2019t for the collection? She pauses, \u201cI always knew about the collection, and I always knew that it was not getting the attention that it should have. So probably not.\u201d\n\nKylie Minogue\u2019s shoes are one of over 850,000 items that make up the Arts Centre\u2019s performing arts collection. Credit: Justin McManus Only a few snippets of the personal weave their way into the conversation \u2013 Quinlan\u2019s laser-sharp focus is on her work and her plans as chief executive, but she does have one long-term side project that she lights up when she speaks about. Research into Australian artist Agnes Goodsir. It\u2019s an interest that has seen her digging through archives for several years. \u201cI like the process, and I love the discovery, and I\u2019m addicted to it.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know what final form this research will take, acknowledging that it is difficult to dedicate time to the project while working a demanding job.\n\nQuinlan is halfway through her five-year contract and has a lot of plans for the next few years. But she also has her eye on the future, both for herself and those following in her footsteps. She\u2019s not someone who never plans to retire. The bill at Sak\u00e9 Credit: \u201cIt\u2019s actually good thing to let younger people come in and take on \u2013 you can\u2019t hold on to these roles forever. I think with CEOs and director roles, it\u2019s good to see the movement,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I think about collecting institutions, curators stay with the collection, and they keep working. They\u2019ve got that lifelong contribution, and they\u2019ve got great knowledge. But I think when you\u2019re a CEO or a director, you can move a bit more, and I think you should.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019m fairly ambitious for every institution I\u2019ve ever worked for ...I won\u2019t be here forever, but I want to make sure what I do in the time that I am here is really as significant and maintains what this place is.\u201d",

        "text": "It may sound obvious, but Greenaway says one of the most important things to do if you\u2019re feeling disconnected is to speak up. Yet, many of us feel like we can\u2019t. In a report from not-for-profit Friends for Good, more than half of respondents said they would be embarrassed to tell someone they were feeling lonely, while only 29 per cent said they had opened up to someone about their loneliness. \u201cThere\u2019s this tendency to assume that social relationships are an inevitable part of life \u2013 they either work or they don\u2019t,\u201d says Greenaway. \u201cBut actually confronting that myth and saying, \u2018I know this isn\u2019t inevitable ... maybe I need to start verbalising some of these feelings and trying to do something about it.\u2019\u201d And as Greenaway points out, research shows people tend to react more positively than we think when we disclose hidden truths about ourselves and how we feel.\n\nMaking plans is a strategy often used by psychologists during Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. Just as it sounds, it\u2019s about carving out time for things that bring us joy, align with our values or help get us closer to our short or long-term goals. As Greenaway points out, enriching our personal lives isn\u2019t just about having fun but is actually a must for our wellbeing. \u201cLooking after our social health isn\u2019t just a nice bonus. Ultimately, it ends up being a matter of life and death. It sounds quite extreme, but there\u2019s evidence to suggest being more socially connected actually has as strong or an even stronger effect on mortality than things like giving up smoking or drinking less.\u201d Quality over quantity The good news is there\u2019s no prescriptive model for what a healthy personal life should look like.\n\n\u201cWhat research shows is that quality matters more than quantity,\u201d says Greenaway. Some people may be completely fine with just seeing a few friends once a fortnight, while others will need more. Regardless, having some idea of what a meaningful social life looks like to you and a framework to help foster it is important. \u2018The brief chat with the barista is actually a pretty good antidote to isolation.\u2019 Professor Lisa Williams, UNSW \u201cIf you have some structure, it can make it easier to unthinkingly connect with others. You can set up your life and environment in a way where you\u2019re getting your social needs met. But if you have to think about going out when you need to, it might already be too late,\u201d she says. This could look like a regular fortnightly call with a friend or joining a local sport club.\n\nProfessor Lisa Williams, a social psychologist at UNSW, suggests a two-pronged approach to nurturing meaningful connections. The first, she says, is about engaging with deep relationships we already have and thinking about what we want from them. \u201cIs it sitting down and having a chat? Is it doing something you enjoy together that\u2019s meaningful to both of you?\u201d The second is about connecting with acquaintances or \u201cleaning into casual social connections\u201d. \u201cThe brief chat with the barista is actually a pretty good antidote to isolation,\u201d Williams says.\n\nSticking to a plan Scheduling activities is one thing, but actually following through on them can be tricky, particularly if you are feeling down. Loading But the act of making plans itself can be a powerful motivator. Williams says research on goal-setting shows that \u201cimplementation intentions\u201d increase the likelihood of us sticking to a plan.",

But it\u2019s just about staying healthy and keeping the body ticking over. Because if it does, you never say never, really. Like if it does happen, it\u2019d be great, but there\u2019s always local footy as well,\u201d Smith, now working in construction, said.\n\nSmith, the father of two young children, had played 42 games before his ban. He knew as soon as he was randomly tested that he was in trouble.\n\n\u201cThey are random tests. Obviously, when you get the tap on the shoulder \u2026 it was a deflating feeling because I am like: \u2018Ah f---, I think I am in trouble here\u2019. Then you get the call from the club saying: \u2018You need to come in, something has come up\u2019. I went in and they handed me with the game-day testing \u2013 it was a shocking feeling,\u201d Smith said.\n\n\u201cThen you get involved with lawyers. You don\u2019t really understand how much lawyers cost until you are dealing with them. The first three months were horrible. I thought I was going to be back playing in three months, which is the thing that sucks. If you don\u2019t do it the day of the game, it is three months. But, for some reason, they thought \u2013 I did it close to the game, but definitely didn\u2019t do it the day of the game. That\u2019s the thing that sucks, that they didn\u2019t see through that.",

Her club, Chelsea, also opted not to sanction her while Kerr\u2019s sponsors have all stood by her throughout the controversy.\n\nVan Egmond said Matildas players were thrilled to have Kerr back, albeit still unavailable to help them in matches.",
