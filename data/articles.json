        "text": "AFL Victoria is set to review the circumstances that led to Kyneton Football Netball Club's (KFNC) women's side breaking away to form their own entity following allegations of a \"volatile environment\".\n\nKFNC has denied the allegations from departing women's players.\n\nThe review will be assisted by Taryn Lee, a strategic advisor who was involved in the Collingwood Football Club's \"Do Better\" review and its implementation.\n\nWhy Kyneton's women's side left their club Photo shows Kyneton Football and Netball Club players in a huddle Kyneton Football and Netball Club's women's team decided to break away from the club in the wake of what players describe as a \"horrible, volatile environment\".\n\nIt comes as women's teams across the country struggle to field sides at long-standing clubs, which players attribute in part to cultural differences and inequitable treatment.\n\nLeaders and players within women's footy argue that bringing female teams into systems that have been long male dominated is often unsustainable without cultural change, given the different needs of women and girls.\n\nThis follows claims of poor treatment, inequitable access to resources and a lack of club support from players around Victoria.\n\n'Why are we still fighting to play football?'\n\nFollowing the introduction of AFLW in 2017, women's and girls' participation surged with about 600,000 now playing across the country. This is compared to about 600 in 2015, according to figures from the AFL.\n\nBut across the country, concerns are being raised about the health of women's clubs, particularly in regional areas, and several have folded due to a lack of participation.\n\nPlayers from Kyneton Women's Club during training. (Supplied: Sophie McLeod)\n\nKate Tellefson, who plays at Frankston Football Club Womens, has been a part of three women's sides that have folded.\n\nThe latest being Seaford Football Netball Club (SFNC), which axed its women's teams this year after not having enough players to field a single team for the 2025 season, despite fielding two teams in 2024.\n\nThe others were Mount Eliza, which failed to field a team past its inaugural season in 2016, and the Frankston Bombers, who struggled to get a women's team back up after the COVID years.\n\nTellefson, who was also the women's football director at SFNC before resigning mid-2024, was among several former players who told the ABC they felt women were not treated equally to men at the club and felt the club did not adequately address their issues.\n\nKyneton women's team players have made claims of inequitable treatment. (Supplied: Kyneton Women's Football Club)\n\nOne former player, who wanted to remain anonymous so she could speak freely without fear of repercussions within the community, said the situation at Seaford was \"really heartbreaking\".\n\nShe said after several discussions with key club people, many players got to the point where they were in meetings asking themselves: \"Why are we still fighting to play football in 2024?\"\n\nIn a statement provided to the ABC, SFNC acknowledged some players expressed dissatisfaction, particularly with coaching approaches, but said claims that players' concerns were ignored were not accurate.\n\n\"Right up to our season launch, we were hopeful that new or returning players would help us reach numbers. Sadly, this did not eventuate. Our intention is to relaunch the women's football program at Seaford in 2026 with renewed energy and support,\" the statement read.\n\n\"We acknowledge the challenges of the past season and are committed to rebuilding a vibrant and supportive women's program. We remain deeply proud of our female athletes and volunteers and are determined to see women's football thrive again at Seaford in 2026 and beyond.\"\n\n'Ongoing devaluing of women who play football'\n\nSeaford is one of many Mornington Peninsula Football Netball League clubs that have struggled with women's participation numbers, including Sorrento, Devon Meadows, Hastings, Rosebud, Frankston Bombers, Pines and Mount Eliza.\n\nCerberus had to merge with Crib Point, and so did Balnarring and Red Hill, to continue to play.\n\nWomen's football worries Photo shows An action shot of women playing football Concerns are being raised about whether women's football clubs are being appropriately supported as clubs across regional Victoria are forced to fold.\n\nIn Tasmania, Evandale, one of the oldest women's teams in the state, went into recess for the 2025 season and Brighton withdrew from the Southern Football League citing a lack of players.\n\nMeander Valley looked headed for a similar fate before a public outcry saved them for another season.\n\nIn the Change Our Game \u2014 State of Play Survey, almost one third (28 per cent) of women who played community sport said they had considered leaving their club due to inequitable treatment.\n\nIn the report released in July 2023, of the 670 Victorians canvassed, more than half reported gendered discrimination in community sport and 55 per cent said they had experienced or seen sexist language and jokes.\n\nClubs across the country are struggling to field women's teams. (Supplied: Kyneton Women's Football Club )\n\nKellie Sanders is a lecturer at La Trobe University who has researched barriers to women's sport across Aussie rules, rugby, soccer and American football across the globe.\n\nShe said women often received \"second-class treatment\", including in accessing resources or grounds.\n\n\"But the cultural one is this ongoing devaluing of women who play football,\" Dr Sanders said.\n\n\"So what my data would suggest is that there's something about the values and beliefs of those in positions of authority that impacts how women's teams are supported or not.\"\n\n'We don't want to be bottom rung'\n\nPioneer of elite women's football and AFLW commentator, Chyloe Kurdas, has been involved in women's footy since she played for Parkdale and Melbourne Uni in the late 90s and early 2000s.\n\nSince the introduction of AFLW, she said there had been a real haste and a lot of enthusiasm to set up women's teams at existing clubs but without an understanding of how to make them sustainable.\n\nKurdas says female-only or female-run clubs have been the most enduring. (Getty: Jonathan DiMaggio/AFL Photos/via Getty Images)\n\nThe clubs she has found to have been the most enduring have been female-only and female-run clubs, such as Melbourne University, Darebin and St Kilda City.\n\nDiamond Creek and Western Spurs started as teams integrated into men's club structures, but eventually left to stand on their own, which then supported their significant success.\n\nKurdas said these clubs made decisions top down with the needs of women and girls at the fore.\n\nWhereas, in existing clubs, women have had to integrate into systems already there, often with a mentality of: \"We'll give you some footies, we'll give you a coach, we'll give you some jumpers, we'll give you a ground to train on, as long as it doesn't impact the boys.\"\n\nWomen's teams are often diverse and inclusive. (Getty: Kelly Defina/AFL Photos)\n\nShe said when cracks started to show at clubs that had added women's teams on, things could become difficult.\n\n\"Then there's this unspoken, perceived hierarchy of what's the most important at a club, who gets prioritised,\" she said.\n\n\"And so what you end up with is the women say, 'This doesn't feel great. It's unsafe now for us to stay here.\n\n\" 'We don't feel valued and respected, we don't want to play, we don't want to be bottom rung [of the ladder]. We want to just be treated fairly.' And that's the issue. \"\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nFurthermore, Kurdas added, there could often be a clash of culture as women's footy was particularly queer-friendly and forward.\n\n\"Women are already using a lot of social courage to come and play footy and then are coming into these footy clubs, which are the epitome of that traditional masculinity,\" she said.\n\n\"And so the psychological and the emotional transition, the cultural transition that needs to occur, it's probably the most important bit \u2026 because the needs of women and girls are really different.\n\n\"And people have really underestimated how important that investment is in that cultural transition and adaptation for both entities \u2014 the women's and men's clubs coming together and saying: 'What does it mean for us to have an integrated club?.'\"\n\nThe AFL has been contacted for comment.",

(ABC News: Bridget McArthur)\n\n\"Key freight lines have simply been closed, meaning farmers and growers and producers are paying more for road transport, and those trucks are now part of the morning traffic in Perth suburbs,\" he said.\n\nLabor said part of that study would consider how the network could be integrated with the national rail network, which the party said could be achieved by the Commonwealth taking direct control of the rail line between Fremantle and Kalgoorlie.\n\nHuge freight demand\n\nThe WA government said demand on the network was at record highs, driven in particular by bumper grain harvests and new mining developments.\n\nInland port would improve freight movement with fewer trucks on the road Photo shows A politician in a white business shirt on a train platform as freight train passes in background. Western Australia's premier says plans to transform Kalgoorlie-Boulder into an inland port are unlikely to happen unless the state's rail freight network is back in government hands.\n\nIt argued doing so would allow for greater investment into the rail infrastructure, improvements in road safety and cost savings by having a more efficient link for commodities to reach Perth\u2019s port.\n\nIt comes as the WA government is pushing ahead with its multi-billion dollar Westport plan.\n\nThat would see the city\u2019s main container port in Fremantle dismantled and relocated south to the heavy Kwinana industrial zone, which would be serviced by an upgraded freight rail and road network.\n\nHow will it work?\n\nIn January, the government wrote to Arc Infrastructure to raise its intention to enter negotiations to return the freight rail network back into public hands.\n\nThe government said after those talks it would make a final decision if it was economically and financially responsible to do so, and that it would be open to a staged return to public ownership.",

But for Liz, a diagnosis after becoming a mother shed further light on why she found infertility treatment so tough.\n\n\"I didn't realise that I was autistic until about 12 months post-childbirth when I realised my son was showing signs of autism,\" the 39-year-old from Perth/Boorloo says.\n\n\"In terms of my IVF journey, it annoyed me that I didn't know sooner because I would have made some changes \u2026 [which might have had an impact on] my ability to cope, potentially the outcomes, or advocating for myself more than I already did.\"\n\nLiz, who works as a clinical and counselling psychologist, has been motivated by her experience to develop a program helping neurodivergent women navigate IVF.\n\nWe spoke with Liz about her IVF experience, and what would have helped her as an autistic person.\n\nThese are her words.\n\nA quick note, this story mentions pregnancy loss.\n\nI lost every one\n\nLiz Bancroft works with other neurodivergent women navigating fertility treatment. (Supplied)\n\nI had a natural pregnancy 13 years ago after I got married, which resulted in a miscarriage.\n\nThen I wasn't able to conceive naturally \u2014 that's when I started looking into IVF.\n\nThe first clinic I went to wouldn't treat me because of my BMI. So I had gastric lap-band surgery, which was then revised and turned into a gastric sleeve.\n\nI lost 55 kilograms overall.\n\nSign up to the ABC Lifestyle newsletter Get a mid-week boost and receive easy recipes, wellbeing ideas, and home and garden tips in your inbox every Wednesday.

They weren't interested in trying different protocols, so I found a third clinic [with] a slightly different approach.\n\nAt first we tried ovulation induction. I fell pregnant naturally three times in a row, three months in a row, and I lost every one.\n\nAt that point I switched to IVF. But beforehand, I pushed for a laparoscopy as I was certain I had endometriosis. They found some mild endo, and a cyst attached to my uterus, and removed all of that.\n\nWe implanted the only two embryos I had. One of them took, and that is what resulted in my son.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help: Red Nose Grief and Loss 24/7 Support Line on 1300 308 307\n\nGrief and Loss 24/7 Support Line on 1300 308 307 Pregnancy, Birth and Baby (advice from maternal child health nurses) on 1800 882 436\n\n(advice from maternal child health nurses) on 1800 882 436 PANDA (Perinatal Anxiety and Depression Australia) on 1300 726 306\n\n(Perinatal Anxiety and Depression Australia) on 1300 726 306 Bears of Hope (infant loss support for families) on 1300 114 673\n\nI went back last year to start all of this again, but the first round resulted in no embryos out of 30 collected eggs.\n\nThe second resulted in one, but unfortunately that embryo didn't implant.\n\nI'm now almost 40 and too financially stretched for more IVF.\n\nThe plan is to try naturally in the coming months, but if it doesn't happen, I'll have to accept that I am only able to have just the one.\n\nAll roads led back to myself\n\nI work with a lot of neurodivergent clients and am very good at early diagnosis and non-stereotypical presentations.\n\nBut I always assumed I was neurotypical.\n\nWhen I saw clear signs of autism in my son, he had to get that from somewhere, and it wasn't my husband.\n\nAll roads linked back to myself.\n\nLiz's son is now aged two. (Supplied)\n\nSome professionals might have assumed what I was experiencing was post-natal anxiety, but what I was struggling with was lack of control in my everyday routine.\n\nI was usually a very structured, controlled person, so my symptoms or sensitivities were never aggravated.\n\nAll that went out the window with a baby.\n\nI got therapy and worked through all the possibilities, for example childhood attachment issues and trauma.\n\nBut when I screened myself, I saw that many symptoms were just very borderline clinical levels of autism, and some surpassed.\n\nWhen I ran it past a few colleagues and friends, they were all like, 'Yeah Liz. We've known this for a while.'\n\nDoes stress impact fertility? Photo shows A woman wearing a red singlet sits down cross legged, her hands resting on knees, in a leafy park. It's not uncommon for couples to be told that if they could \"just relax\", becoming pregnant would be easy.\n\nIt was a huge relief, looking back over my life and reframing everything through a neurodivergent lens.\n\nIt made so much sense to me.\n\nAll those horrible labels I'd been given like anal retentive, bossy, dramatic, high maintenance.\n\nIt helped repair some of those self-esteem wounds.\n\nI was about to have a meltdown\n\nOne of the pinnacle examples of how autism shaped my experience with IVF would be egg collection.\n\nIt's a very intense procedure and a pivotal point in treatment which will determine potential outcomes following that.\n\nThere is some research that shows chronic and acute stress can potentially have a negative impact on outcomes at egg collection.\n\nYou have to show up at a very specific time. Then there is a window they need to operate within to get results, as you've taken medication beforehand to stimulate this process.\n\nOn one occasion, we weren't greeted at the waiting room.\n\nThey were running late.\n\nNobody updates you on anything.\n\nThe lights are very bright, people are making noise.\n\nYou have some wishy-washy instructions from your last appointment.\n\nFor an autistic person who needs structure and routine, it can be quite stressful.\n\nThe environment started to grate on me, and I was becoming more stressed and overstimulated.\n\nIt got to the point I felt I was about to have a meltdown, so I had to leave.\n\nPacing is a stimming behaviour for me, so I paced outside for 40 minutes before I was seen.\n\nMy nervous system had been activated, and I wonder how much of that stress response could have impacted my egg collection.\n\nDealing with IVF debt when you're childless Photo shows couple hugging and looking out window Any debt linked to fertility treatment can be a painful reminder for childless people that life didn't go as they planned. And it's often not just financial debt they are left with, either.\n\nHelping neurodivergent women through IVF is my new baby\n\nOffering to slow down verbal explanations, especially if processing speed is a concern for the patient.\n\nHaving more clear written instructions and visual aids.\n\nDimming lighting in waiting rooms.\n\nAddressing sensory issues around temperature in theatres.\n\nOptions for weighted blankets. Noise-cancelling headphones.\n\nThese are things that could have helped me.\n\nNeurodivergent patients may have some greater needs, and we know an autistic woman is more likely to placate, passively comply, or shut down than they are to speak up for themselves.\n\nHelping women with my program is essentially my new baby.\n\nLiz is sharing her personal story for advocacy purposes.

(ABC Pilbara: Susan Standen)\n\nLocals disappointed with plans\n\nBHP said Pier Park would be a community space that paid homage to the history of the hotel through a \"walk down memory lane\".\n\nMr Carter said he wanted to see something constructed that would provide more benefit to locals.\n\nSimilarly, Ms Jacobs said it was a \"little underwhelming\" to turn the space into a park.\n\nBut she acknowledged the land had development restrictions.\n\n\"It looks like \u2026 that's going to attract people but I think the loss of history is what is upsetting the community,\" she said.\n\nMs Jacobs said she would prefer to see it turned into a backpackers' or tourism centre.\n\n\"We're not ungrateful for it \u2014 we're just saying that something like that, with such an iconic status, has high value of history to the community,\" she said.\n\nBHP said demolition would begin this month, and the community and relevant stakeholders would be updated as the plan progressed.",

        "text": "Arsenal has kept Liverpool's Premier League title-winning champagne on ice but only just as it was twice pegged back to draw 2-2 at home by Crystal Palace.\n\nFirst-half goals by Jakub Kiwior and Leandro Trossard looked like being enough for a lacklustre Arsenal against a lively Palace side which earlier equalised with an Eberechi Eze volley.\n\nBut there was a late twist as Palace substitute Jean-Philippe Mateta pounced on a lazy pass at the back from William Saliba, leaving intended recipient Martin \u00d8degaard sprawled on the turf as Mateta produced a superb chipped finish over Arsenal keeper David Raya from outside the box in the 83rd minute.\n\nThe draw left second-placed Arsenal on 67 points with four games remaining, meaning it can only match the 79 of Liverpool, which still has five games to play.\n\nHad Arsenal lost, Liverpool would have won the title but they can now seal it with just a draw against Ange Postecoglou's Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield on Sunday (Monday morning AEST).\n\nBoth Arsenal and Palace have huge cup semifinal games looming: Arsenal in the Champions League at home to Paris St Germain next Tuesday and Palace this Saturday against Aston Villa in the FA Cup.\n\nTwelfth-placed Palace could have been excused if they were distracted by what will be the biggest game of their season.\n\nInstead, it was Arsenal who were off the pace as they drew for the 13th time in the league this season and fifth time in eight \u2014 a statistic that has allowed Liverpool to all but mathematically wrap up a record-equalling 20th English title.\n\nPalace, who left key players Mateta and Ismaila Sarr on the bench but still fielded Eze, will have taken great heart from their display as they prepare for Villa.\n\nABC Elite Athletes in Australian Women's Sport Survey: We want to hear from you Photo shows A stylised graphic with three silhouettes of unidentified a female footballer, tennis player, basketballer ABC Sport and Deakin University have partnered to produce the first ABC Elite Athletes in Australian Women\u2019s Sport Survey.\n\nEze took his goal brilliantly, connecting with Adam Wharton's corner to bounce a volley in off the post past Raya.\n\nBut the best was saved to last as Mateta, still wearing the protective covering on his ear badly gashed in the FA Cup fifth-round tie against Millwall, swooped after Saliba missed captain \u00d8degaard's direction for a back pass to the goalkeeper and the Palace man lofted a sensational shot over Raya.\n\nIf Liverpool can avoid losing to Spurs, they will lock up their first title since breaking a 30-year drought in 2020 and end Manchester City's run of four straight.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

        "text": "Western Australia's expansive and largely barren north is often in the headlines as the \"engine room of the nation's economy\".\n\nBut that value, combined with its proximity to the Indo-Pacific, also makes it significant to Australia's defence interests.\n\nIt's why the Defence Strategic Review (DSR), a generational assessment of Australia's defence forces, called for bases in northern Australia to be \"urgently and comprehensively remediated\" in 2023.\n\n\"The bases to the north are important because it's our first line of defence,\" University of Western Australia Defence and Security Institute research fellow Troy Lee-Brown said.\n\nDr Lee-Brown says bases like Curtin and Learmonth are highly important. (Supplied: UWA)\n\nThe need for that defence has grown, Dr Lee-Brown said, because of \"changes in the security structure\" of our region, led by China's military build-up.\n\nRecent reports of Russia's interest in basing aircraft in Indonesia have also raised questions about what that future structure could look like, despite Australia receiving assurances our close neighbour would not grant a request along those lines.\n\nA Defence spokesperson said its latest Integrated Investment Program included between $14 and $18 billion over the next decade for \"a logistically connected and resilient set of bases, ports and barracks across Australia's north\".\n\nA plane on the tarmac at RAAF Base Learmonth, more than 1,200km north of Perth. (ABC News: Rebecca Parish)\n\n\"The government has already approved more than $1 billion in north Western Australia infrastructure upgrades over the forward estimates, including over $700 million for airfield upgrades at RAAF Base Learmonth, to widen and strengthen the runway and taxiway,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Construction will commence shortly and [is] expected to be completed in 2027.\"\n\nDr Lee-Brown said works were \"overall \u2026 tracking in the right direction\".\n\n\"Whether it's quick enough is another matter entirely,\" he said.\n\nPriorities need to shift\n\nChair of the US-Asia Centre Kim Beazley has a firm answer to that question of timing.\n\n\"We're not completely unprepared but we don't have yet enough, and the government is undertaking to ensure that we start to get enough,\" the former Labor defence minister and ambassador to the US said.\n\n\"We are going to have to, over the next few years, shift priorities to get there.\n\nKim Beazley says defence policy is in the right area, but resourcing will be key. (Four Corners)\n\n\"It does cost money and it does take people and all has to be provided in order to be able to do it.\n\n\"I think we're now much better focused on the defence of our northern approaches, at least policy-wise, than we have been for quite some time.\n\n\" The plans are there. The question is to get the resources in to do it and starts have been made. \"\n\nDefence spending pledges\n\nPart of that could come from the Coalition's pledge yesterday to increase defence spending from 2.04 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product, where it sits now, to 2.5 per cent by 2030.\n\nThat is more ambitious than Labor's plan to lift spending to 2.3 per cent of GDP by 2033.\n\n\"This announcement today, which is a record announcement into defence of $21 billion, is not only going to get us to 2.5 per cent of GDP \u2026 it's going to allow us to invest in our defences across the north,\" Mr Dutton said in Perth on Wednesday.\n\nPeter Dutton spoke alongside Shadow Defence Minister Andrew Hastie (left) at a defence manufacturing facility in Perth. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said Labor had \"put in $57 billion additional funding over 10 years\" and would \"make budget decisions every year\".\n\nIt's unclear though how much either party will invest in strengthening defences in northern WA, or the rest of northern Australia.\n\n'Glaring hole' in defence\n\nOne area where one of the people who worked on the DSR hopes future funding is directed is a \"glaring hole\" in Australia's integrated air and missile defence.\n\nDefence review identifies WA's north as key area of concern Photo shows Woodisde's Scarborough gas project includes expanding the current Pluto facility on the Burrup Peninsula Australia's first major defence force review in a generation says the nation's geographical benefits are \"radically reduced\", with WA's north now a \"primary area of military interest\".\n\n\"Fundamentally, to protect the northern part of Australia, and particular parts of the northern parts of Western Australia where we have key military bases \u2026 we need ground-based air defence,\" the director of foreign policy and defence at the University of Sydney's US Studies Centres, Peter Dean, told ABC Radio Perth.\n\n\"At the moment there is a sort of a commitment that we identified in the Defence Strategic Review that there should be a medium-range surface-to-air missile capability.\n\n\"But there's yet to be any dedicating funding towards this and there's yet to be a clear program of how we're going to deliver this quickly and that is an urgently needed area.\"\n\nProfessor Dean estimated that project would cost between $6 and 8 billion.\n\nNorthern bases at minimal staffing\n\nAnother issue to grapple with is the staffing of bases in northern WA.\n\nCurrently, both Learmonth and Curtin are considered \"bare bases\" with minimal regular staffing but the ability to handle an influx of troops at short notice.\n\nRAAF Base Learmonth is one of the bases that needs to be running at a higher capacity, according to Dr Lee-Brown. (ABC News: Alistair Bates)\n\n\"As the region becomes more fractious and strategic warning time has evaporated \u2026 it's strategically important for Australia to have its northern bases running at a greater capacity than they currently are,\" Dr Lee-Brown said.\n\nBut neither major party would commit to that.\n\nAsked if bases in northern WA should be permanently staffed, the opposition leader said he would \"look at the advice from Defence at the time\".\n\nThe US Air Force and RAAF run joint training exercises over Curtin airbase. (Supplied: U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Dylan Nuckolls)\n\n\"But I've been very strongly supportive of us increasing our fuel reserves and making sure that our capabilities are as strong as they can be in our northern and our north-western approaches,\" Mr Dutton said.\n\n\" So we should look more closely with the United States and see what further investment can be made by the US in the top-end. \"\n\nThat was despite his shadow defence minister later that day saying Australia cannot take the US alliance for granted under President Donald Trump.\n\nStaffing levels considered\n\nWhen asked, Defence Minister Richard Marles agreed the bases were important but would not say what Labor was committing to.\n\n\"We need a defence force that can project, because the location of Australia's national security is not the coastline of our continent, in fact [it] lies much further out,\" he said in Perth on Tuesday.\n\nRichard Marles says Australia's defence strategy needs to be considered past the coastline. (ABC News: Courtney Withers)\n\n\"And in order to be able to project it is really important that we have a strong line of northern bases, including the northern part of WA. That is literally the platform from where we project.\n\n\"Upgrading those bases is a really important part of what we are doing in terms of restructuring our defence force and building a defence force which can project.\"\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese indicated staffing was being considered.\n\nDefence force shifts posture as Australia enters 'missile age' Photo shows A missile being fired in the desert. The federal government announces a major shift in Defence's posture as the world enters the \"missile age\", warning Australia's natural defences have been radically reduced.\n\n\"One of the things that the Defence Strategic Review indicated was the need for our posture, our defence force posture, to be located towards the north,\" he said in WA on Wednesday.\n\n\"That's a program that's being worked out through the Department of Defence with the Defence Minister, Richard Marles.\"\n\nWA Premier, Roger Cook, suggested he was content with current levels.\n\n\"Every Western Australian premier would say we'd want a bigger military presence in the north-west,\" he told ABC Radio Perth.\n\nPremier Cook says significant work has been done to relocate defence assets into WA. (ABC News: Ian Cutmore)\n\n\"We believe that there's a lot of strategic economic assets there. We believe that it is a point of vulnerability because it's such a vast coastline.\n\n\"I do believe that the Albanese Labor government, through the Defence Strategic Review, has done some significant work to relocate a lot of defence assets into Western Australia and that's a very pleasing development.\"",

Email us abcsport5050@your.abc.net.au\n\nAlready having earned notable wins over the experienced duo of Sara Errani and Jil Teichmann in qualifying, the US-born Joint, who has made massive strides over the past two seasons since throwing in her lot with the nation of her Australian dad, came through a roller-coaster first-round affair.\n\nIt was the Brisbane-based youngster's first match in a tour-level clay event, but she showed why her record in smaller clay-court tournaments has been so encouraging as she overcame a second-set lapse to dominate the impressive Spanish tour debutant Martinez Cirez.\n\nJoint, who was ranked 269 in the world this time last year, eked out her victory in two hours and seven minutes, setting up the chance to make even more waves when she faces American world number 10 Emma Navarro in the second round.\n\nAjla Tomljanovi\u0107's hopes of joining Joint in the last 64 ended with a disappointing 6-3, 1-6, 7-5 defeat to world number 153 Rebeka Masarova, who is ranked 74 places below the Australian.\n\nWith Kim Birrell having been beaten by American Peyton Stearns, it leaves just Joint and Daria Kasatkina, set to take on American Alycia Parks in her second competition as an Australian competitor, flying the flag in the women's draw.\n\nABC Sport Daily podcast ABC Sport Daily is your daily sports conversation. We dive into the biggest story of the day and get you up to speed with everything else that's making headlines.\n\nOn the men's side, Chris O'Connell earned himself an inviting shy at Taylor Fritz, hoping to conjure up a sensation in the 'Magic Box' with the American world number four a potentially vulnerable target after his 2025 injury woes.\n\nThe indefatigable O'Connell, one of the busiest Australians on tour in his 10th tournament of the year, earned a handy win in the first round of the ATP 1000 event at the Spanish capital's famous Caja Magica venue, beating Argentinian world number 59 Camilo Ugo Carabelli 6-3, 6-4.\n\nThe 30-year-old O'Connell, ranked 87, converted all three of the break points he earned and saved seven of the eight he faced to join compatriots Alex de Minaur and Alexei Popyrin, who both had byes, in the second round.\n\nThere he'll face US Open and ATP finals runner-up Fritz, the third seed who's competing in his first clay-court tournament of the season after a 2025 campaign dogged by an abdominal injury that's prevented him playing anywhere near his best.\n\nThe ABC of SPORT Sports content to make you think... or allow you not to.

Got it Share\n\nThere\u2019s a croque craze going on. No, not the ugly-fashionable footwear. We\u2019re talking the ugly-delicious sandwich. And Mitch & Antler\u2019s croque madame is particularly ugly, particularly delicious. Hence why co-owner Chewie Choo wonders aloud if his sandwich started the trend. Mitch & Antler\u2019s croque madame. Morgan Roberts \u201cAfter we launched it, I think it was about three or four months later that I seemed to start noticing them everywhere,\u201d he says. Perhaps. Perhaps not. Either way, Mitch & Antler\u2019s variation on the classic French toasted sandwich proved so popular after the cafe\u2019s opening in 2023 that Choo and his brother and co-owner Tze-Huei Choo then built an entire second venue, James & Antler (now sold), around the concept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe creation of Mitch & Antler Full-service cafes are hard in 2025. They\u2019re expensive to staff and run, and if you\u2019re going to pass some of that on to the diner, you need to make it worth their while. \u201cWe wanted to do something different to the traditional breakfast menu items,\u201d Chewie says. \u201cEveryone can make, like, an eggs Benedict.\u201d Related Article Flash new supper club hides in plain sight on James Street So, Mitch & Antler\u2019s menu is full of interesting variations on the classics, or the kind of thing you might\u2019ve glimpsed on Instagram. Omurice with wagyu mince and edamame. Korokke with saut\u00e9ed kale and poached eggs. Brown butter croffles. That kind of thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the star item for the Mitchelton cafe since opening is its croque madame. Despite all it has going on, the croque madame is still surprisingly simple to eat. Morgan Roberts Mitch & Antler\u2019s croque madame You might think the croque madame (basically, a fancy French toastie) is the kind of thing you could make at home. And you\u2019re probably right, but according to the Choos it would be messy and expensive. \u201cEveryone can do a croque but no one can do the leek bechamel we do,\u201d Tze-Huei says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think most people are crazy enough to buy the amount of manchego cheese that we tend to shave over the top.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat else goes into this thing? Two slices of Cordelia sourdough baked to Mitch & Antler\u2019s specs, lashings of thick-cut smoked ham from Bangalow Sweet Pork, and Egmont cheese. Then, on top, goes the seeded mustard and leek bechamel, a fried egg, chives and the manchego \u2013 the whole thing given a dash of flame before it hits the plate. Introducing Brisbane\u2019s best hangover cure Mitch & Antler buzzes with punters on weekends. Morgan Roberts On the plate, the croque is a fabulous slice (or two slices) of organised mess. You might be tempted to tackle this thing with a knife and fork. Don\u2019t bother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite everything going on with this sandwich, it holds together well and the toasted Cordelia sourdough is soft on the inside, meaning you avoid any mouth-shreddings. It would almost be a one-hander but for the wibbly-wobbly fried egg on top. Our favourite play is to order it takeaway to enjoy on a park bench somewhere nearby. Mitch & Antler co-owner Tze-Huei Choo. Morgan Roberts There\u2019s a lot to love about this sandwich \u2013 the perfectly specced bread, the smokey goodness of the chunky ham, that gooey egg. Still, it\u2019s the tangy bechamel that makes it, with the sweetness and texture of the leek and acidity of the mustard. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like tomato adding acidity to a toasted sandwich,\u201d Tze-Huei says. \u201cThat\u2019s the mustard. Then, the leek adds that sweetness.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a sizeable sanger, but you\u2019ll still destroy this thing within a few minutes, the only signs of its previous existence the yolk and bechamel left on your fingers.

        "text": "You can\u2019t find a metric for this on the stat sheet, but you can see it in their ability to control tempo and momentum. It might be how their players pull back off the mark to give the game time to reset ahead, or how, when they spot they have their opponents outnumbered up forward, they flick the switch with speed and a running handball-receive. This Collingwood side has been elite at closing games out over the past two or three seasons. But now, that same situational clarity is showing up across four quarters. They\u2019re making the right decisions consistently \u2013 a skill that only comes with experience. Forward line cohesion Every player in Collingwood\u2019s forward line is a threat. They work for each other. There\u2019s chemistry, a sixth sense about the way they move together. Everyone knows their role and plays it. No one is chasing stats \u2013 they\u2019re chasing moments.\n\nBrody Mihocek, Tim Membrey and Jamie Elliott are helping form a deadly Collingwood forward line. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images The Pies\u2019 tall forwards \u2013 Brody Mihocek, Dan McStay, Tim Membrey and Mason Cox \u2013 are all giving strong aerial contests, working in tandem. One offers a link-up, one provides depth. And the key? Any one of them can kick two or three goals on a given day. There aren\u2019t many forward lines where you can say that. It makes it difficult for opponents to decide who their best defender should go to. Then there\u2019s the smalls. The speed and pressure they bring is elite. Take Bobby Hill\u2019s rundown tackle on Dayne Zorko in the third quarter last week \u2013 textbook desperation. It led to a Nick Daicos goal and summed Collingwood\u2019s intent. And when a Collingwood player gets the ball in a tough spot, they don\u2019t blaze away. They centre it. It\u2019s unselfish, smart footy.\n\nTough on the inside, polish on the outside Yes, contested possession still matters, but our game has a new layer now \u2013 it\u2019s about execution and efficiency. You need players who are not only tough inside but also clean and sharp on the outside. Loading Melbourne and Carlton are among the teams who\u2019ve so far been great on the inside but lacked the polish to connect going forward. The Pies? They\u2019re cutting teams up on turnover. Their transitional offence hurts opponents who can\u2019t reset quickly enough. They create chains through the corridor, knowing exactly where the numbers are. One kick or handball inside can open up the overlap, and suddenly, they have a wave of players surging forward. They have outscored opponents from that source in all five wins. It\u2019s a key number that has a strong correlation to premiership success. The Magpies rank third now (+18.2 points).\n\nTheir clearance work and selfless set plays are all about getting each other free \u2013 constantly shifting the focus and keeping the opposition guessing. It makes it tough for rival midfields to lock in on a single threat because the danger can come from anyone at any moment \u2013 much like their forward line. And that\u2019s not just when they attack; the same workrate flows into Collingwood\u2019s defence. When their defenders push high, they trap teams in, shrink the ground, and deny their opponents ball movement. It\u2019s why they\u2019re dominating time in forward-half differential \u2013 winning that stat every week and ranking second in the competition overall. Where teams fall down is when their lines lose connection \u2013 when their backs hold too deep under pressure and midfielders surge ahead. That leaves dangerous gaps. But the Pies? They\u2019re staying connected. It\u2019s why their turnover defence has been so strong. Their shape holds up. That\u2019s structure. That\u2019s system.\n\nDefensive game Experience matters here too. After conceding 104 points to GWS in the opening round, Collingwood have since restricted the Power, Dogs, Blues, Swans, and Lions \u2013 all finalists last season \u2013 to 78\n\npoints or fewer. They kept Brisbane to their slowest ball-movement game since 2019 and just 37 inside 50s. Ruckman Darcy Cameron is an asset to Collingwood\u2019s defence with his desire to push back and take intercept marks. Credit: Getty Images They\u2019re playing the pressure and territory game, and it\u2019s working. Early in the season, the Pies\u2019 midfielders and wingers were getting sucked into the contest too often, leaving the outside exposed. But now they\u2019re holding their width.\n\nThere\u2019s a discipline to the way they structure around the contest \u2013 players hunting in numbers, but with purpose. They close off outlets while still supporting the inside heat. Because they\u2019re getting the balance right, they\u2019re able to defend their own turnovers better, too. They\u2019re not taking risks that leave them vulnerable. That\u2019s experience showing again. The best part? It\u2019s not just left to the defenders. Everyone\u2019s committed to slowing the opposition down.\n\nLoading There\u2019s trust \u2013 if one player presses, another will fill the gap behind. That kind of coverage takes organisation, awareness, and belief in the system. And then you\u2019ve got Darcy Cameron. The best intercepting ruckman in the comp right now, he\u2019s averaging 2.6 intercept marks per game and consistently dropping into the hole to shut down long kicks. Massive. You\u2019ll often notice Collingwood\u2019s off-ball small forwards pushing right up onto the opposite wing, creating a release for players such as Steele Sidebottom to slide back into the defensive 50m. It gives the backline extra support while also setting up a clean outlet for transition after a turnover or intercept.\n\nThe Daicos factor Nick Daicos is arguably the best player in the AFL at transitioning from inside a contest to outside. He\u2019s tough to tag because he makes opposition teams pull apart their own structure to follow him. And he knows it. He moves himself around \u2013 half-back, forward line, midfield \u2013 just to shift the magnets and pull defenders out of their comfort zones. Nick Daicos is giving opponents headaches with his ability to get the ball in contests and burst away into open space. Credit: Getty Images Whoever is on him must have body contact on him at all stoppages. He\u2019ll get the ball \u2013 that\u2019s a given \u2013 but the damage comes when he slices through the congestion and delivers with precision.\n\nThen there\u2019s his brother Josh. He holds his width perfectly on the wing, becoming a key metres-gained player. By five minutes into the second quarter last week against the Lions, he had over 330 metres gained. That\u2019s massive in a territory-based game. The verdict Collingwood are experienced, well-drilled and fully locked in on the way the game is evolving. Their list profile, once seen as a potential weakness, has become their point of difference. They\u2019ve got the system, the structure, and the smarts. Age won\u2019t weary them. It might just carry them all the way again.\n\nA day of meaning There\u2019s a deep sense of responsibility that comes with honouring the Anzac spirit. On Anzac Day, players aren\u2019t just representing their club \u2013 they\u2019re representing the fallen, their families, and every Australian who made sacrifices for the freedoms we enjoy today, including the joy of footy. You can feel the emotion in the air during the pre-game ceremonies \u2013 shoulders squared, arms linked, eyes ahead\u2014as the anthem rings out and the weight of history settles in.

Hearing her memories reminded me how deeply\n\nANZAC Day echoes through Australian families. But it also left me wondering: how can the women\u2019s game honour that legacy too?\n\nAIF Sergeant James Donald Kennedy, at 34 years old while serving in World War II after a stint earlier in his life at St Kilda Football Club. Credit: Birch family Born in 1907, James was a talented young footballer who played for St Kilda in the 1920s. He had dreams, drive, and a passion for the game. But when World War II began, like so many others, his path changed. Though too old to be conscripted, he volunteered without hesitation. He was first stationed in Darwin before boarding a troop train to Townsville, and then the SS Taroona to New Guinea. There, he served as a linesman on the front line \u2013 laying and repairing vital communication lines under fire. It was work that demanded immense bravery and resilience. Hearing his story filled me with pride, but also a sense of connection. Anzac Day isn\u2019t just about honouring names in history books; it\u2019s about remembering the people we come from. People like James Donald Kennedy, who didn\u2019t seek glory, but stood up when it mattered most.",

        "text": "Listen to Australian and world news, and follow trending topics with SBS News Podcasts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRANSCRIPT\n\n\n\n\n\nThe National Party of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso known as the Nationals or the Nats.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey're known for their big hats and focus on regional Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut where did the Nationals come from? And who are they now?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nationals were originally known as the Country Party.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen they were formed in 1920 they largely set out to be the voice for rural Australians, particularly given the importance, at the time, of farming to the Australian economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The idea was that it was only those people who represented those country communities who would be part of the party.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's the National President of the National Party, Kay Hull.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe says the focus of the party hasn't changed much over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The mandate for the party has always been to deliver security and opportunity, prosperity, equity for rural, regional, and remote Australians and to have their value recognized and respected for the contribution that we make. It sits probably more conservative in its values and its principles.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSo the party is focused on regional Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nSenior Lecturer at the Australian National University Dr Jill Sheppard says that includes regional businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They want protection for certain industries, they do not want free trade for the most part, they've had to really been dragged kicking and screaming to free trade agreements or to the removal of tariffs. But also, the Nationals don't like trade unions, and that's where they fundamentally diverge from the Labor Party. So the Nationals support agricultural industries, but they really support the people who control those industries, the large scale farmers.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMs Hull says extends to improving the overall communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"To be competitive in the global environment, you need a strong, resilient, robust, well resourced, rural, regional, remote communities, right? It cannot happen without that happening. So our objective is to ensure that we have the competitive edge in communications, transport, road infrastructure, bridge infrastructure, etc, okay. It's also important that you need to have people that will settle there. They will not come unless you have quality education opportunities. You have quality access and affordable access to health and general services, community services, strong and safe communities.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWhilst the National Party has never formed government on its own, they have been a part of a lot of governments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first coalition was with the now non-existent Nationalist Party in 1922, and they have entered similar deals since then.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1946 the Nationals teamed up with the Liberal Party, a partnership which continues to this day. This is why you often hear the pair being referred to as the coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy being in a coalition, the two parties have an agreement on how they work together.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe leader of the party with more seats gets to be the overall leader, whilst the leader of the smaller party is the deputy leader.\n\n\n\n\n\nA mix of members from both parties get to be ministers.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of the federal Liberal-National coalition, it's always the been the Liberal party with more seats, with Liberal party leaders as Prime Ministers.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Sheppard says the National Party's achievements are sometimes quiet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"When the Nationals have had the most power in Australian politics, it's been by working closely with a Liberal Prime Minister. The Nationals will never form government in their own right. They're just not big enough. So they work in coalition with the Liberal Party, and they help them to form government when without the Nationals, Labor Party would form government much more than they do. It doesn't mean that the relationship between the Liberals and the Nationals is very happy, because apart from both being vaguely pro business, one party really likes free trade and the other party hates free trade. And when that's a big part of your platform, that can be really difficult. So I think the Nationals key achievements have been in holding the Liberal Party back on what they would do otherwise. And that's not always visible.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBy working together as a coalition, the two parties can attract a broader voter base.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberal Party can focus on big city issues, and the National Party can almost exclusively champion for regional ones.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Dr Sheppard says there's still a few local contests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They do still contest some seats. There's about five seats across the country where Liberal Party and National Party candidates run against each other. There's no reason why they should. It's strategically very bad. But they continue to do that, mostly because deep down, they really don't like each other. And so if they can have a little pressure valve, you know, a few contests around the country where they can compete head to head, that seems to be all they need at the moment to, you know, be sort of happy partners, happy colleagues 99% of the time.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, David Littleproud is National's leader which makes him deputy leader of the coalition.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the coalition wins the election he will be the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother notable face is Barnaby Joyce, who is still in Parliament and has led the party twice.\n\n\n\n\n\nThey've merged with the Liberal Party in Queensland and the Northern Territory, known as the LNP and the Country Liberal Party respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe election, the Nationals are running on policies aimed at improving regional Australia, including:\n\n\n\n\n\n- Decreasing energy costs by increasing gas supply\n\n\n\n\n\n- Building more homes in the regions\n\n\n\n\n\n- Overturning the ban on live sheep exports\n\n\n\n\n\n- And improving the way farmers are treated by big businesses like supermarkets.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how does the party stack up to its original manifesto?\n\n\n\n\n\nPretty well, says Dr Sheppard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Nationals have stayed really true to their original idea of what they wanted their party to be. Now there'd be people in the Nationals who disagree with me vigorously on that, but in terms of just having a clear sense of purpose, these are the industries that we represent, they have not changed it a bit.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The price of gold has surged to its highest value on record amid volatile stock markets and global economic uncertainty, as investors move their money to what they hope is a \"safe haven\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe price of gold per ounce rose to US$3,500 ($5,477) on Tuesday, the highest value it has reached since records began. It later dropped back to around US$3,280 ($5,165).\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the International Monetary Fund is predicting global economic growth will fall by 0.5 per cent , as the economies of the United States and China weaken.\n\n\n\n\n\nDr Pramod Kumar Yadav, a lecturer in finance at the University of Sydney Business School, earlier told SBS News the recent stock market crashes are due to the uncertainty that economic measures like trade tariffs can create, making stock markets risky for investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There are also going to be people moving money from risky assets like the stock market to safer assets like cash, gold, and government bonds,\" he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE Why the IMF is slashing Australia's economic growth forecast\n\nGold has historically been considered a reliable commodity for investors, immune to stock market crashes and government decisions.\n\n\n\nDoes gold have any real value?\n\nHonorary professor Andrew Stoeckel, an economist from the Australian National University, told SBS News gold has no \"intrinsic\" economic value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"How would having a bucket of gold on a desert island help you? It would be useless, you can't eat it, you can't plant crops with it. But people like shiny stuff,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSource: SBS News Much like the stock market, which is perceived as a value rather than physical cash, there is a belief that gold is scarce and precious, which gives it a valued status in society, Stoeckel said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe likened gold to silver, saying that while they are both precious metals, silver has physical applications and uses, such as being a good conductor, which gold lacks.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said the appeal of gold over the centuries is that it is a physical, tangible object that people believe governments and institutions will continue to \"honour and value\".\n\n\n\nHow would having a bucket of gold on a desert island help you? It would be useless, you can't eat it, you can't plant crops with it. But people like shiny stuff. Andrew Stoeckel, Australian National University\n\n\"There have been periods of high uncertainty, and people have flocked to gold, but again, gold has no intrinsic value. Just the belief that it does,\" Stoeckel said.\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Swan, a professor of finance from the University of NSW Business School, told SBS News gold, like any commodity, is based on supply and demand, and that the supply of gold is unlikely to spike.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Unless another explorer like Columbus comes across a big bucket of gold in the Americas, we're unlikely to see a change,\" he said.\n\n\n\nLISTEN TO Gold returns to a record as investors digest tariff outlook SBS News 11/04/2025 10:52 Play\n\nHow does investing in gold work?\n\nSwan said investing in gold is no different from other forms of investment, as you still get a return for your money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They all exist on a spectrum and have different proportions of cash or earnings in returns. Shares have a dividend yield of around 4 or 5 per cent, while investing in housing gives a lower yield of around 2 per cent,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Gold has zero cash component because the expected appreciation is far higher.\"\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to invest in gold, including buying physical gold, such as jewellery or bullion, directly from the Royal Australian Mint.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also buy shares in a gold exchange-traded fund, where gold is bought on behalf of shareholders.\n\n\n\nWould the gold prices continue to rise?\n\nSwan predicted the popularity of gold and its value would continue to rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The beauty of gold is that the supply is relatively fixed, and that's going to continue, and political and economic uncertainty are probably going to get a lot worse. So we're going to see the price of gold, I think, rise even higher,\" he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe pointed to US President Donald Trump's \"rocky\" relationship with Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell as just one reason investors were losing faith in the stock market.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere could be more economic \"chaos\" when Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs is over, Swan said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"There may be a resurrection of these crazy tariff arrangements, which would kill the global economy, in which case gold, of course, would be seen as a very safe haven in such turbulent times.\"\n\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Coalition has unveiled plans to boost Australia's defence spending to 3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).\n\n\n\n\n\nIt says it will spend an extra $21 billion on defence over the next five years , which would see expenditure increase to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2029/30 \u2014 reaching an estimated $87.5 billion. Over the next decade it will boost this even further.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn contrast, according to the March federal budget, Labor's spending is estimated to be $79.1 billion by 2029/30, making up 2.26 per cent of GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia's current defence spending is roughly 2 per cent of GDP, or $56 billion in 2024/25.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor plans to grow this to 2.35 per cent \u2014 or a projected $100 billion by 2034 \u2014 according to its national defence strategy .\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition says it will grow spending more quickly. It plans to reach 2.5 per cent by 2029/30, reaching 3 per cent by 2034/35.\n\n\n\nHow much is 3 per cent of GDP?\n\nGDP, which measures the value of goods and services produced within a country's borders, can change every year, but the March budget predicted Australia's GDP would grow to $4.5 trillion in the next decade.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these estimates, the Coalition would spend roughly $135 billion on defence by 2034-35. Its spending is estimated to be $30 billion more than Labor's in that financial year, according to the current trajectory.\n\n\n\n\n\nExperts warn against using GDP as a measure for predicting spending, given it goes up and down depending on whether the economy is moving through periods of growth or recession.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the expected spending on defence would be slightly higher than the amount spent on health this year ($124 billion), and double the $54 billion the government spends on education.\n\n\n\nWhere will the additional funding go?\n\nIt remains unclear exactly where the extra defence spending will go.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton said drones, guided weapons, munitions and cyber capabilities are all on the Coalition's wish list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"But we're not announcing procurement contracts from Opposition, which would be something we're not able to do without that advice. But they're the capabilities that we need to invest in,\" he told reporters in Perth on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is certain, is that $3 billion will be spent on 28 extra fighter jets, increasing Australia's fleet of F-35s from 72 to 100.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever that leaves an additional $18 billion in spending over the next five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition could afford roughly another 125 guided multiple launch rocket systems \u2014 valued at $145 million each.\n\n\n\n\n\nOr they could acquire three to four extra Virginia class submarines, costing $5 billion each, according to the Australian Naval Institute.\n\n\n\n'We need to keep our country safe'\n\nDutton said keeping Australians safe was the \"single most important task for the Australian government\" as he made the announcement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It will be an important expenditure, because we need to keep our country safe, and if we're to preserve peace and stability in our region, if we're to be a good ally with our partners, then Australia needs to invest in defence,\" he said.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE The billion-dollar problem that neither Albanese nor Dutton wants to become a big issue\n\nJennifer Parker, defence expert at the ANU's National Security College, said an increase in funding is important amid growing global uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"It's not just about preparing us for conflict, but a stronger defence force means the chances of conflict are less likely,\" she told SBS News.\n\n\n\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump has called for NATO members to lift their defence budgets to 3 per cent. When quizzed by reporters, Dutton refrained from stating this informed the Coalition's policy.\n\n\n\nDefence Minister Richard Marles is critical of the Coalition's promised defence splurge, querying where the funding will come from. Source: AAP / Tertius Pickard Defence minister Richard Marles accused the Opposition of \"plucking a number out of thin air\".\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Coalition hasn't revealed exactly how it will pay for the ongoing increase but pointed to $17.1 billion in savings over forward estimates from repealing Labor's tax cuts, if elected.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional reporting by Rania Yallop.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest from SBS News, download our app and subscribe to our newsletter .\n\n\n\n",

Got it Share\n\nThere\u2019s a croque craze going on. No, not the ugly-fashionable footwear. We\u2019re talking the ugly-delicious sandwich. And Mitch & Antler\u2019s croque madame is particularly ugly, particularly delicious. Hence why co-owner Chewie Choo wonders aloud if his sandwich started the trend. Mitch & Antler\u2019s croque madame. Morgan Roberts \u201cAfter we launched it, I think it was about three or four months later that I seemed to start noticing them everywhere,\u201d he says. Perhaps. Perhaps not. Either way, Mitch & Antler\u2019s variation on the classic French toasted sandwich proved so popular after the cafe\u2019s opening in 2023 that Choo and his brother and co-owner Tze-Huei Choo then built an entire second venue, James & Antler (now sold), around the concept.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe creation of Mitch & Antler Full-service cafes are hard in 2025. They\u2019re expensive to staff and run, and if you\u2019re going to pass some of that on to the diner, you need to make it worth their while. \u201cWe wanted to do something different to the traditional breakfast menu items,\u201d Chewie says. \u201cEveryone can make, like, an eggs Benedict.\u201d Related Article Flash new supper club hides in plain sight on James Street So, Mitch & Antler\u2019s menu is full of interesting variations on the classics, or the kind of thing you might\u2019ve glimpsed on Instagram. Omurice with wagyu mince and edamame. Korokke with saut\u00e9ed kale and poached eggs. Brown butter croffles. That kind of thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the star item for the Mitchelton cafe since opening is its croque madame. Despite all it has going on, the croque madame is still surprisingly simple to eat. Morgan Roberts Mitch & Antler\u2019s croque madame You might think the croque madame (basically, a fancy French toastie) is the kind of thing you could make at home. And you\u2019re probably right, but according to the Choos it would be messy and expensive. \u201cEveryone can do a croque but no one can do the leek bechamel we do,\u201d Tze-Huei says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think most people are crazy enough to buy the amount of manchego cheese that we tend to shave over the top.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat else goes into this thing? Two slices of Cordelia sourdough baked to Mitch & Antler\u2019s specs, lashings of thick-cut smoked ham from Bangalow Sweet Pork, and Egmont cheese. Then, on top, goes the seeded mustard and leek bechamel, a fried egg, chives and the manchego \u2013 the whole thing given a dash of flame before it hits the plate. Introducing Brisbane\u2019s best hangover cure Mitch & Antler buzzes with punters on weekends. Morgan Roberts On the plate, the croque is a fabulous slice (or two slices) of organised mess. You might be tempted to tackle this thing with a knife and fork. Don\u2019t bother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite everything going on with this sandwich, it holds together well and the toasted Cordelia sourdough is soft on the inside, meaning you avoid any mouth-shreddings. It would almost be a one-hander but for the wibbly-wobbly fried egg on top. Our favourite play is to order it takeaway to enjoy on a park bench somewhere nearby. Mitch & Antler co-owner Tze-Huei Choo. Morgan Roberts There\u2019s a lot to love about this sandwich \u2013 the perfectly specced bread, the smokey goodness of the chunky ham, that gooey egg. Still, it\u2019s the tangy bechamel that makes it, with the sweetness and texture of the leek and acidity of the mustard. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like tomato adding acidity to a toasted sandwich,\u201d Tze-Huei says. \u201cThat\u2019s the mustard. Then, the leek adds that sweetness.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a sizeable sanger, but you\u2019ll still destroy this thing within a few minutes, the only signs of its previous existence the yolk and bechamel left on your fingers. Where to get it Mitch & Antler\u2019s croque madame is $21. You can get one at 62 Suez Street in Mitchelton. We recommend hitting it on the weekend to make the most of the croque\u2019s truly magical hangover-curing properties.\n\nRestaurant reviews, news and the hottest openings served to your inbox.

        "text": "Politics was the last thing on Catherine Buck and Joel Morgan\u2019s minds when they locked in May 3 as their wedding date just over a year ago. They had found the perfect venue in Sorrento on Port Phillip Bay near Melbourne, and were excited about their autumn nuptials.\n\nBut just over a month before their ceremony, their big day\u2019s date was overshadowed. After hours upon hours of planning and a few hefty non-refundable deposits, there was no way around it \u2013 the couple would announce their commitment to each other while the nation committed to its leaders.\n\nHaving a wedding the same day as the federal election? Catherine Buck and Joel Morgan aren\u2019t worried. Credit: Simon Schluter\n\nFor some, sharing the date with the federal election could have spelt disaster. Can family members put political disagreements aside? Will guests be distracted? Can everyone vote and make it to the wedding on time? But for Buck and Morgan, who are more or less on the same political page, it was nothing to panic about.\n\n\u201cThe election is obviously very important, but we\u2019re only getting married once,\u201d Buck says. \u201cSo, it will be on our minds, but we won\u2019t be completely obsessed with it.\u201d",

        "text": "You can\u2019t find a metric for this on the stat sheet, but you can see it in their ability to control tempo and momentum. It might be how their players pull back off the mark to give the game time to reset ahead, or how, when they spot they have their opponents outnumbered up forward, they flick the switch with speed and a running handball-receive. This Collingwood side has been elite at closing games out over the past two or three seasons. But now, that same situational clarity is showing up across four quarters. They\u2019re making the right decisions consistently \u2013 a skill that only comes with experience. Forward line cohesion Every player in Collingwood\u2019s forward line is a threat. They work for each other. There\u2019s chemistry, a sixth sense about the way they move together. Everyone knows their role and plays it. No one is chasing stats \u2013 they\u2019re chasing moments.\n\nBrody Mihocek, Tim Membrey and Jamie Elliott are helping form a deadly Collingwood forward line. Credit: AFL Photos via Getty Images The Pies\u2019 tall forwards \u2013 Brody Mihocek, Dan McStay, Tim Membrey and Mason Cox \u2013 are all giving strong aerial contests, working in tandem. One offers a link-up, one provides depth. And the key? Any one of them can kick two or three goals on a given day. There aren\u2019t many forward lines where you can say that. It makes it difficult for opponents to decide who their best defender should go to. Then there\u2019s the smalls. The speed and pressure they bring is elite. Take Bobby Hill\u2019s rundown tackle on Dayne Zorko in the third quarter last week \u2013 textbook desperation. It led to a Nick Daicos goal and summed Collingwood\u2019s intent. And when a Collingwood player gets the ball in a tough spot, they don\u2019t blaze away. They centre it. It\u2019s unselfish, smart footy.\n\nTough on the inside, polish on the outside Yes, contested possession still matters, but our game has a new layer now \u2013 it\u2019s about execution and efficiency. You need players who are not only tough inside but also clean and sharp on the outside. Loading Melbourne and Carlton are among the teams who\u2019ve so far been great on the inside but lacked the polish to connect going forward. The Pies? They\u2019re cutting teams up on turnover. Their transitional offence hurts opponents who can\u2019t reset quickly enough. They create chains through the corridor, knowing exactly where the numbers are. One kick or handball inside can open up the overlap, and suddenly, they have a wave of players surging forward. They have outscored opponents from that source in all five wins. It\u2019s a key number that has a strong correlation to premiership success. The Magpies rank third now (+18.2 points).\n\nTheir clearance work and selfless set plays are all about getting each other free \u2013 constantly shifting the focus and keeping the opposition guessing. It makes it tough for rival midfields to lock in on a single threat because the danger can come from anyone at any moment \u2013 much like their forward line. And that\u2019s not just when they attack; the same workrate flows into Collingwood\u2019s defence. When their defenders push high, they trap teams in, shrink the ground, and deny their opponents ball movement. It\u2019s why they\u2019re dominating time in forward-half differential \u2013 winning that stat every week and ranking second in the competition overall. Where teams fall down is when their lines lose connection \u2013 when their backs hold too deep under pressure and midfielders surge ahead. That leaves dangerous gaps. But the Pies? They\u2019re staying connected. It\u2019s why their turnover defence has been so strong. Their shape holds up. That\u2019s structure. That\u2019s system.\n\nDefensive game Experience matters here too. After conceding 104 points to GWS in the opening round, Collingwood have since restricted the Power, Dogs, Blues, Swans, and Lions \u2013 all finalists last season \u2013 to 78\n\npoints or fewer. They kept Brisbane to their slowest ball-movement game since 2019 and just 37 inside 50s. Ruckman Darcy Cameron is an asset to Collingwood\u2019s defence with his desire to push back and take intercept marks. Credit: Getty Images They\u2019re playing the pressure and territory game, and it\u2019s working. Early in the season, the Pies\u2019 midfielders and wingers were getting sucked into the contest too often, leaving the outside exposed. But now they\u2019re holding their width.\n\nThere\u2019s a discipline to the way they structure around the contest \u2013 players hunting in numbers, but with purpose. They close off outlets while still supporting the inside heat. Because they\u2019re getting the balance right, they\u2019re able to defend their own turnovers better, too. They\u2019re not taking risks that leave them vulnerable. That\u2019s experience showing again. The best part? It\u2019s not just left to the defenders. Everyone\u2019s committed to slowing the opposition down.\n\nLoading There\u2019s trust \u2013 if one player presses, another will fill the gap behind. That kind of coverage takes organisation, awareness, and belief in the system. And then you\u2019ve got Darcy Cameron. The best intercepting ruckman in the comp right now, he\u2019s averaging 2.6 intercept marks per game and consistently dropping into the hole to shut down long kicks. Massive. You\u2019ll often notice Collingwood\u2019s off-ball small forwards pushing right up onto the opposite wing, creating a release for players such as Steele Sidebottom to slide back into the defensive 50m. It gives the backline extra support while also setting up a clean outlet for transition after a turnover or intercept.\n\nThe Daicos factor Nick Daicos is arguably the best player in the AFL at transitioning from inside a contest to outside. He\u2019s tough to tag because he makes opposition teams pull apart their own structure to follow him. And he knows it. He moves himself around \u2013 half-back, forward line, midfield \u2013 just to shift the magnets and pull defenders out of their comfort zones. Nick Daicos is giving opponents headaches with his ability to get the ball in contests and burst away into open space. Credit: Getty Images Whoever is on him must have body contact on him at all stoppages. He\u2019ll get the ball \u2013 that\u2019s a given \u2013 but the damage comes when he slices through the congestion and delivers with precision.\n\nThen there\u2019s his brother Josh. He holds his width perfectly on the wing, becoming a key metres-gained player. By five minutes into the second quarter last week against the Lions, he had over 330 metres gained. That\u2019s massive in a territory-based game. The verdict Collingwood are experienced, well-drilled and fully locked in on the way the game is evolving. Their list profile, once seen as a potential weakness, has become their point of difference. They\u2019ve got the system, the structure, and the smarts. Age won\u2019t weary them. It might just carry them all the way again.\n\nA day of meaning There\u2019s a deep sense of responsibility that comes with honouring the Anzac spirit. On Anzac Day, players aren\u2019t just representing their club \u2013 they\u2019re representing the fallen, their families, and every Australian who made sacrifices for the freedoms we enjoy today, including the joy of footy. You can feel the emotion in the air during the pre-game ceremonies \u2013 shoulders squared, arms linked, eyes ahead\u2014as the anthem rings out and the weight of history settles in.

Hearing her memories reminded me how deeply\n\nANZAC Day echoes through Australian families. But it also left me wondering: how can the women\u2019s game honour that legacy too?\n\nAIF Sergeant James Donald Kennedy, at 34 years old while serving in World War II after a stint earlier in his life at St Kilda Football Club. Credit: Birch family Born in 1907, James was a talented young footballer who played for St Kilda in the 1920s. He had dreams, drive, and a passion for the game. But when World War II began, like so many others, his path changed. Though too old to be conscripted, he volunteered without hesitation. He was first stationed in Darwin before boarding a troop train to Townsville, and then the SS Taroona to New Guinea. There, he served as a linesman on the front line \u2013 laying and repairing vital communication lines under fire. It was work that demanded immense bravery and resilience. Hearing his story filled me with pride, but also a sense of connection. Anzac Day isn\u2019t just about honouring names in history books; it\u2019s about remembering the people we come from. People like James Donald Kennedy, who didn\u2019t seek glory, but stood up when it mattered most.",

        "text": "Aussie mum Ashlea Hodder has hit out at those who don't do one vital thing when they leave their campsites.\n\nAn Aussie mum is urging others to be mindful of the dangers of campfires after an Easter weekend camping trip ended in disaster for her family. Ashlea Hodder was packing up her campsite on Sunday after spending the long weekend with friends and family when she asked her children to look out for koalas while they packed up their area.\n\nA short time later, she heard her daughter Coral scream out \u2014 the seven-year-old had inadvertently stepped onto the remnants of another group's fire at Keelbottom Creek near Mingala, west of Townsville.\n\nThe little girl dropped to the ground in searing pain and in doing so, burned her hands as well. The youngster, whose birthday is next week, now faces a long road to recovery from her third-degree burns.\n\n\"We told the kids to go and explore and [my daughter] walked straight through the fire,\" Ashlea told Yahoo News. The mum raced to her aid and recalled the gut-wrenching feeling of finding her child \"screaming\" in pain.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I was so overwhelmed, I didn't know what to do,\" she said.\n\nThe family dropped everything and raced her to the nearest hospital, which was over an hour away. Coral suffered third-degree burns on her right foot and her fingers, and the family now has an anxious wait to see if she needs to have skin grafts.\n\nThe seven-year-old faces a long recovery after the painful injury. Source: Supplied\n\nCamping family say putting out fires is 'common sense'\n\nSeasoned camper Ashlea has hit out at the neighbouring campsite who \"left their fire\" still simmering.\n\n\"It's common sense to put out your fire,\" she told Yahoo News, adding that she's been left \"angry and upset\" at the ordeal. \"It could have happened to anyone, or it could have caused a bushfire.\"\n\nShe pointed out the campsite was \"right next\" to a creek and the water could have been used to put out the fire. \"My kids know not to touch or go anywhere near the fire,\" she said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAshlea said Coral is in \"a lot of pain\" and the ordeal has been \"very traumatising\" for the young girl.\n\n\"She said she doesn't want to go camping again and has called herself stupid because she didn't look where she was going,\" the mum said. \"I've told her that it's not her fault. It could have happened to anyone.\"\n\nWhile Ashlea concedes her daughter was barefoot at the time, she believes her children deserve the opportunity to \"be kids and get dirty\".\n\n\"Just make sure you put out your fires with water, don\u2019t stomp them out or cover them with sand, take extra water with you because you never know what\u2019s going to happen,\" she urged other campers.\n\nDo you have a story tip?
